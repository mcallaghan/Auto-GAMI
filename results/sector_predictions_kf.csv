The response to climate variability among farm families in Northern Ghana,"This study examines the effect of human capital on the adoption of coping mechanisms to extreme climatic conditions (drought, flood, and bushfires) by farm households in the Bawku West district of Ghana. Results indicate that literacy level, membership in a farm organization, and access to credit had positive and significant impacts on adaptation to drought. Similarly, source of seeds for planting, and household income had positive significant influence on adaptation to flood. Adaption to bushfire was positively influenced by radio ownership, and farm size. The main effect of the climatic extreme events on households were found to be destruction of crops, livestock and buildings; food and water shortage; poor yield or harvest and limited fields for livestock grazing. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Sheep breeding in Central Tunisia: varied strategies and adaptations to changes in land use,"Sheep breeding in central Tunisia remains widespread, despite the many problems it had to face since the 1970s: climate hazards, socio-economic and cultural changes and the development of cropped area. These changes have led to a decrease in forage resources from rangelands. The aim of this study was to understand how families are able to maintain sheep breeding in such a context. The study involved a survey among a sample of 60 farmers in 2012-2013. We identified four types of livestock systems. Three types are based on the raising of ewes and the production of lean or fat lambs. ""Transhumant pastoralists"" are using long-distance mobility to access rangelands with wild vegetation, managed by the State. ""Crop-Livestock"" farmers use stubble for pasture, along with other resources derived from farmed land and have a greater adaptive capacity to cope with changes. Multi-active families are the most affected by the extension of crops at the expense of rangelands. For these three systems, many farmers are thinking of decreasing their number of ewes or even giving up sheep farming, due to the difficulties they face. A fourth ""trader-fattener"" system is strongly developing, based on fattening purchased lean lambs with grain, without raising ewes. This activity is profitable in the short term but is vulnerable to price fluctuations of feed supplements.",0.8980326914990564,0.2769028592245739,0.10382370143500373,0.5078567861574461,0.04572751479283934,0.0229083482009635,0.031643423674412245
"I eat two meals per day impact of climate variability on eating habits among households in rufiji district, tanzania: A qualitative study","Background: Improved understanding of the influence of climate variability on eating habits is required to manage health outcomes that could be produced. Agriculture production is the main source of income to people in Rufiji district, where communities produce food for household and also for income. Effects of climate variability and weather extremes include occurrence of floods and prolonged dry seasons, which are recently reported to be very frequent in Africa continent, affecting food production. Prolonged dry seasons as well as frequent floods have been reported to destroy cultivated food crops in Rufiji district. However, there is little evidence on climate variability effects on household food security and their eating habits in Tanzania. Therefore, this study assessed the influence of climate variability impacts such as prolonged dry seasons and floods on the eating habits of Tanzanian rural households. Results: Study findings showed that respondents recognized changes in seasonal trends such as rainfall pattern and increase in temperature in the area. Drought and floods reduce food production and cause shortages in households. Low and poor harvest of food crops is the major contributing factor in their farms of rice and maize, the main staple food crops grown amidst prolonged dry seasons. They reported existence of household food shortage which was not there 10years ago. Participants developed adaptation mechanisms that included reducing food quantity, eating of new meals which were not eaten before as a main meal such as cooked unripe mangoes and stiff porridge. Household members decided to change eating habits as an adaptation strategy to the situation of food shortage. Some discussants acknowledged reducing number of meals, eating two meals a day instead of three or four as it was 10years ago. Conclusion: Climate variability has led to reduced amount of annual rainfall, thus affecting food productivity and consequently food shortages and changes in dietary habits among the people in Rufiji. Additional research is warranted to assess the impacts of climate variability on nutritional quality of meals. © 2016 The Author(s).",0.9595140872867957,0.20353686989154962,0.07367199513533908,0.5428686498150821,0.030124714679511232,0.014789324852571376,0.060197710166167734
"Migration and Self-Protection Against Climate Change: A Case Study of Samburu County, Kenya","Climate change will affect the livelihoods of pastoralists in arid and semi-arid lands. Using data on agro-pastoral households from northern Kenya, we explore whether migration of household members enhances adoption of agricultural innovations that aim to provide protection against weather shocks. Specifically, we seek to test whether migration and adaptation are complementary mechanisms to protect the household against adverse shocks, or whether they are substitutes. Do remittances relax capital constraints and facilitate the uptake of adaptive measures, or do they render adaptation superfluous? Our data provide suggestive evidence that remittances from migrant household members may relax capital constraints, and that remittances are an important mechanism linking migration to adoption, enabling the uptake of new technologies that involve change in activities or high costs. Specifically, migrant households adopt more adaptive measures (promoting self-protection), and we document some support for the hypothesis that this is especially the case for high-cost adaptations such as the purchasing of drought tolerant livestock. These findings suggest that migration and local innovation are complementary rather than substitutive mechanisms of self-protection for pastoral households in the semi-arid lands of northern Kenya. Households who have at least one member who has migrated are able to overcome barriers to employ high cost agricultural innovations through using remittances received thus enhancing their self-protection against climate change related shocks.

Migration as an adaptive strategy to climate variability: a study of the Tonga-speaking people of Southern Zambia,"There is increasing consensus that the effects of extreme weather conditions in the form of drought, flooding and extreme temperature will have increasingly devastating impacts on those who depend on climate-sensitive resources and ecosystems for their livelihoods. The most affected will be the poor in developing countries who have a low adaptive capacity to climate change due to high poverty levels. Despite these projections, there are, to date, insufficient empirical studies linking the relationship between climate change and migration, particularly in the context of southern Africa. Using field-based data collected from two study locations in Zambia, this paper examines the complex relationship between extreme weather events and population movement. It is envisaged that the findings presented in this paper will contribute to current discussions on the complex relationship between extreme weather conditions and population movement specifically in the context of sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries.",0.3432524478303809,0.45162923373551955,0.11294521862669696,0.42733750624974226,0.10417436162181082,0.09095526019521794,0.1738115762027082
DEVELOPMENT OF CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE (CA) SYSTEMS IN MALAWI: LESSONS LEARNED FROM 2005 TO 2014,"Conservation agriculture (CA) was introduced to farmers in Malawi to address soil degradation, declining crop productivity and the need to adapt to climate variability and change. This research from 2005 to 2014 aimed at analysing the effects of CA on longer-term productivity and profitability compared with conventional systems as practiced in two communities of Central Malawi. CA treatments outyielded conventional ridge tilled control plots in Mwansambo and Zidyana on average by between 22 and 31%, respectively. An economic analysis from 2011 to 2014 found that, on average, income was 50 and 83% greater in CA systems than in conventional systems. The crops were produced with 28 -39 less labour days ha(-1) compared with the conventional practice, leading to greater net benefits. Despite the higher returns with CA, there are still challenges with residue retention, weed control, adequate rotations, management of pests and diseases as well as other socio-economic constraints. At the same time, there are opportunities to address these challenges through site-specific and adaptive research using innovation systems approaches.",0.8352199044307325,0.2000234038116239,0.12078631725932468,0.44536529895450405,0.025433880043284725,0.031005674082109247,0.035093648646344996
Adaptation and resilience to climate change and variability in north-east Ghana,"North-east Ghana is characterised by frequent droughts and floods which adversely affect farming, the primary source of livelihood for majority of households in the region. Given the rapidly changing climate, these extreme events are expected to become more pervasive. This paper assesses the capacity of farm households to deal with climate-related risks. Using survey data from 409 farm households in three districts in north-east Ghana, this study specifically examines households' resilience to climate change and variability, and the determinants of the number and choice of adaptation measures adopted by households. Results from an indicator-based climate resilience assessment indicate that female-headed households and households located in Bongo district are less resilient to climate change and variability. The results also suggest that interventions aimed at building households' climate resilience should be mostly directed at raising household income, improving food security, and asset building. To enhance resilience to climate change and variability, households have mostly adopted a combination of autonomous adaptation measures, such as altering the timing of planting, use of drought tolerant and early maturing crop varieties, and switching to crops that are less sensitive to climate stress. Employing Poisson and multivariate probit regression models, it was found that increasing farmers' knowledge of climate change as well as building the capacity of extension agents to deliver information on climate change and appropriate adaptation measures are key to successful adaptation in the study region.

Perception of and response to climate change by maize-dependent smallholders,"Smallholder crop producers in sub-Saharan Africa are adversely affected by climate change because of their reliance on rain for crop production. Promoting adaptation interventions at local scale is unlikely to be effective without understanding farmers' views on climate change. Our study analyzes climate change perceptions and responses by maize-dependent smallholders in Ethiopia. Household-level data on farmers' climate change perceptions and adaptation strategies were collected. In addition, meteorological data were obtained from local weather stations for the period 1985-2015. Descriptive statistics, standard rainfall anomalies, thematic content methods and binary logistic models were used to analyze the relationship between climate change perceptions and adaptations. Findings show that nearly all farmers perceived climate change through increased hot and warm days and nights as well as decreased precipitation volumes. Results indicate that farmers perceive shortened seasonal rainfall duration in terms of both late start and early end. Farmers employ a range of strategies, notably cropping date adjustment, improved crop variety use, crop diversification, agroforestry practices and seasonal migration to adapt to climate change. Farmers' adaptation decisions were mainly associated with their climate change perceptions as well as socio-economic factors such as education level and farm experience. It is, therefore, suggested that recognizing farmers' knowledge and experience on climate change would help develop context-specific, flexible adaptation strategies that better build resilience capacity.",0.9710245489129813,0.19337484227577326,0.06452671286135246,0.5332789512747331,0.0292936773471902,0.009423818671866806,0.027474683241257646
Diversification and adaptation strategies to climate variability: A farm typology for the Sahel,"Sahelian farmers tend to diversify their activities to reduce their vulnerability to external shocks. It is important to distinguish between farmers' types response to these shocks as well as to policy incentives. To develop a typology of farmer adaptation strategies, evaluate the level of vulnerability and assess perceptions of policies, two detailed questionnaire surveys were conducted in a community in northern Burkina Faso. Statistical analysis included a cluster analysis to distinguish farmers' types with regard to their assets and strategies. The results show that the main factors of discrimination were family size, access to small irrigation plots and number of animals. The types react differently to climate variability and are likely to follow contrasting pathways of adaptation. Farmers' food vulnerability is still high according to the applied CILSS vulnerability index, and farmers are pessimistic about their capacity to handle future droughts. They see improved credit schemes and further development of irrigation as the most promising adaptation strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Adapting agriculture to climate change in Kenya: Household strategies and determinants,"Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable to climate change, given dependence on agricultural production and limited adaptive capacity. Based on farm household and Participatory Rural Appraisal data collected from districts in various agroecological zones in Kenya, this paper examines farmers' perceptions of climate change, ongoing adaptation measures, and factors influencing farmers' decisions to adapt. The results show that households face considerable challenges in adapting to climate change. While many households have made small adjustments to their farming practices in response to climate change (in particular, changing planting decisions), few households are able to make more costly investments, for example in agroforestry or irrigation, although there is a desire to invest in such measures. This emphasizes the need for greater investments in rural and agricultural development to support the ability of households to make strategic, long-term decisions that affect their future wellbeing.

Perceptions of and adaptation to environmental change in forest-adjacent communities in three African nations,"Semi-structured interviews were used to explore how rural communities near forests are responding to environmental change in three African nations - Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Rwanda. The study first recounts people's perception of environmental change - what are the issues of greatest concern identified by local communities? Second, it explores people's responses to identified environmental problems and in particular the role of forests in these processes. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of changing land management practices, and how their implementation may affect the future adaptation strategies of such communities. Results suggest that people's current and potential responses and adaptation to environmental change are influenced by the availability and access to forests and forest resources, and the degree to which their livelihood strategies have diversified away from forest dependence. Thus we conclude that forest policies such as REDD+ will need to be responsive to diverse forest-based adaptation needs, rather than assuming a 'one size fits all' relationship between forest conservation and adaptation to climate change.",0.6396010050153494,0.35135329445037294,0.4241078341185428,0.3848333595325326,0.07273620142386197,0.02950962520981439,0.07208565826644323
Drivers of farm-level adaptation to climate change in Africa: an evaluation by a composite index of potential adoption,"Over recent decades, there has been increasing levels of research dedicated to assess drivers of farm-level uptake of adaptation strategies to climate change. The main purpose of this research being to determine how policy intervention can most effectively increase adoption. This paper aims to synthesise this past research in order to scale up uptake of farm-level adaptation strategies through a composite index of potential adoption in Africa. In doing so, we review the estimated coefficients of econometric regressions in 42 case studies published in peer-review journals to identify the factors that regularly explain adoption. We find that these common factors can be grouped into seven components, that is human capital, financial resources, infrastructure and technology, social interaction and governance, food security, dependence on agriculture and attitudes towards the environment. Using national-level indicators of these seven categories, we develop a composite index to inform potential adoption and test the robustness of the index in an in-depth sensitivity analysis. The results show that the highest likelihood of adoption of farm-level adaptation strategies is in Northern African countries namely Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria and Morocco and in Southern African countries such as South Africa and Botswana. Conversely, they indicate that the lowest likelihood of adoption is situated in nations of the Sahel and Horn of Africa and in nations that have recently experienced conflict. We conclude that adoption is associated predominantly with governance, civil rights, financial resources and education. However, it is not necessarily driven by the magnitude of climate change impacts on agricultural production.",0.758669189920948,0.3007954708943815,0.12686486344913597,0.5,0.055426524415077595,0.07337919435254701,0.1678267092748783
"Adapting to Climate Variability and Change: Experiences from Cereal-Based Farming in the Central Rift and Kobo Valleys, Ethiopia","Small-holder farmers in Ethiopia are facing several climate related hazards, in particular highly variable rainfall with severe droughts which can have devastating effects on their livelihoods. Projected changes in climate are expected to aggravate the existing challenges. This study examines farmer perceptions on current climate variability and long-term changes, current adaptive strategies, and potential barriers for successful further adaptation in two case study regions-the Central Rift Valley (CRV) and Kobo Valley. The study was based on a household questionnaire, interviews with key stakeholders, and focus group discussions. The result revealed that about 99 % of the respondents at the CRV and 96 % at the Kobo Valley perceived an increase in temperature and 94 % at CRV and 91 % at the Kobo Valley perceived a decrease in rainfall over the last 20-30 years. Inter-annual and intraseasonal rainfall variability also has increased according to the farmers. The observed climate data (1977-2009) also showed an increasing trend in temperature and high inter-annual and intra-seasonal rainfall variability. In contrast to farmers' perceptions of a decrease in rainfall totals, observed rainfall data showed no statistically significant decline. The interaction among various bio-physical and socio-economic factors, changes in rainfall intensity and reduced water available to crops due to increased hot spells, may have influenced the perception of farmers with respect to rainfall trends. In recent decades, farmers in both the CRV and Kobo have changed farming practices to adapt to perceived climate change and variability, for example, through crop and variety choice, adjustment of cropping calendar, and in situ moisture conservation. These relatively low-cost changes in farm practices were within the limited adaptation capacity of farmers, which may be insufficient to deal with the impacts of future climate change. Anticipated climate change is expected to impose new risks outside the range of current experiences. To enable farmers to adapt to these impacts critical technological, institutional, and market-access constraints need to be removed. Inconsistencies between farmers' perceptions and observed climate trends (e.g., decrease in annual rainfall) could lead to sub-optimal or counterproductive adaptations, and therefore must be removed by better communication and capacity building, for example through Climate Field Schools. Enabling strategies, which are among others targeted at agricultural inputs, credit supply, market access, and strengthening of local knowledge and information services need to become integral part of government policies to assist farmers to adapt to the impacts of current and future climate change.",0.9827157963753811,0.19869499030706872,0.09020818649182605,0.5573631783132539,0.023541105571921257,0.011288438751264571,0.0600439685120933
Effect of climate change adaptation options on monthly food shortages among smallholder farmers in West Africa,"Climate change is among the topmost economic development challenges in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This paper analysed the effect of rural households' adaptation options on monthly food shortages. The data were collected with multi-stage sampling by the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) as a baseline survey to provide comparable data on the impact of climate change in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Senegal using multi-stage sampling method. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and Poisson regression model. Results show that reported erratic and less overall rainfalls mostly affected peanut, although in Burkina Faso and Mali, sorghum and millet were most affected. The farmers were making some changes on their farming systems with 15.94% introducing new crops in Senegal, 23.57% tested new crops in Niger and 81.43% grew high yielding varieties in Ghana. Drought resistant varieties were grown by 20.71% of the farmers from Burkina Faso, 17.86% of those from Ghana and 12.06% of those from Mali. The results of Poisson regression revealed that the data were adequately fitted judging from statistical insignificance of the deviance goodness of fit (p>0.10). Specifically, more involvement of men in raw food production, late planting of crops, number of months households depended on home production, residence in Mali and Senegal reduced the count of monthly food shortages, while introduction of stone lines, residence in Ghana and more involvement of men in timber production increased it (p<0.05). It was concluded that adequate adaptation will assist farmers to mitigate the impact of climate change on food security.",0.9552752435141877,0.16195675455651212,0.03909519840703894,0.6378933944259623,0.030702284138935818,0.016024891194830967,0.022897631826440817
Perceptions of climate change and barriers to adaptation amongst commonage and commercial livestock farmers in the semi-arid Eastern Cape Karoo,"Climate change is expected to adversely affect agriculture in South Africa. A rise in variable and unfavourable conditions is likely to surpass the limits of current coping mechanisms of farmers, compelling them to implement more resilient adaptive measures to decrease their vulnerability to heightened risks. This study assessed the perceptions and understanding of climate change amongst livestock farmers in the semi-arid Eastern Cape Karoo and their responses to perceived changes and associated risks. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews revealed that, while commercial famers were well informed regarding global climate change, commonage farmers had little or no understanding of the phenomenon. Although changes in local climate parameters were identified by farmers, perceived changes were mostly ascribed to the expected climate variability of the region. It was found that commonage farmers are particularly vulnerable to future climate change, whereas commercial farmers, having experience in dealing with the already variable and marginal conditions of the region and facing fewer asset and informational constraints, possess a greater adaptive capacity to respond to projected changes. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that lack of funds, lack of government support and access to information on climate change and potential adaptation strategies are the main factors constraining farmers from adaptation.",0.9642878631768228,0.2148770026610902,0.05038419024748012,0.49133716925610843,0.02499224368739407,0.014657793486512392,0.05124504060879597
Adoption and intensity of adoption of conservation farming practices in Zambia,"This paper analyzes the determinants of farmer adoption of conservation farming practices using panel data from two rounds of the Rural Incomes and Livelihoods Surveys that were implemented in 2004 and 2008. Conservation farming (CF) has been actively promoted in seven of Zambia's nine provinces since the 1980s. CF has the technical potential to contribute to food security and adaptation to climate change; however, rigorous analyses of the determinants of adoption/dis-adoption of these practices, are still scarce. This paper fills this gap by combining rich panel data with historical rainfall data to understand the determinants of adoption and intensity of two CF practices: minimum soil disturbance and crop rotations. Controlling for the confounding effects of household level unobservables, we find that extension services and rainfall variability are the strongest determinants of adoption, suggesting that farmers use these practices as an adaptation strategy to mitigate the negative effects of variable and delayed rainfall. Furthermore, our findings highlight the role of agro-ecological and socio-economic constraints in explaining adoption, as well as the potential role and effectiveness of interventions to support it. Eastern province shows a significantly different trend in terms of both adoption and the intensity of adoption, indicating that the long-established CF activities in the province have had some impact - though high dis-adoption rates are observed even in this province.

Prioritizing investments for climate-smart agriculture: Lessons learned from Mali,"Agricultural productivity and growth in Mali are under threat from erratic rainfall, resulting in more frequent dry years. The national economy is vulnerable to climate change due to 50% of the gross domestic product coming from the agricultural sector and 75% of the population living in rural areas. The Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) concept arises from a need to provide innovative solutions towards the complex and integrated goals of increasing yields, improving resilience, and promoting a low emissions agricultural sector. A major challenge for policymakers to operationalize CSA is the identification, valuation (cost-benefit), and subsequent prioritization of climate-smart options and portfolios (groups of CSA options) for investment. This paper presents the process, results, and lessons learned from a yearlong pilot of the Climate-Smart Agriculture Prioritization Framework (CSA-PF) in Mali. Key national and international stakeholders participated in the co-development and prioritization of two CSA portfolios and related action plans for the Malian Sudanese zone. Initial steps towards outcomes of the process include inclusion of prioritized CSA practices in ongoing development projects and prompting discussion of modifications of future calls for agricultural development proposals by regional donors.

Assessing the returns to water harvesting: A meta-analysis,"This study presents the results of a meta-analysis of the peer reviewed literature on water harvesting technologies, with a focus on the crop yield impacts of water harvesting in semi-arid Africa and Asia. Main aim of the analysis is to assess whether water harvesting significantly improves crop yields, and whether the type of water harvesting technology and the quality of the rainy season correlate with the change in yield. We find that water harvesting improves crop yields significantly, and that the relative impact of water harvesting on crop yields is largest in low rainfall years. Smallholder farmers may still be reluctant to invest in water harvesting, however, as in regions with low agricultural productivity the returns to investment are limited. Finally, our review of the literature suggests that there is only a limited number of studies that has systematically evaluated the crop yield impacts of water harvesting technologies. More work is needed to strengthen the scientific knowledge base. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Farmers' perception and adaptation practice to climate variability and change: a case study of the Vea catchment in Ghana,"Background: Rain-fed agriculture remains the source of employment for a majority of Ghana's population, particularly in northern Ghana where annual rainfall is low. The purpose of this study is to examine farmers' perceptions and adaptation practices to climate change and variability in accordance with actual recorded weather data of the Vea catchment in Upper East Region of northern Ghana during the time interval from 1972 to 2012. Methods: Climatic data over 41-years (1972-2012) from four stations in vicinity of the catchment was evaluated to identify actual weather outcomes. A survey questionnaire targeting farmers with at least 30-years of farming experience in the area was administered in six of the eleven agricultural enumeration areas in the catchment covering 305 km(2). Of the 466 farmers interviewed, 79 % utilized rain-fed practices while 21 % utilized some form of irrigation. Results: Results indicate that nearly 90 % of the farmers interviewed believe that temperature increased over the past 30-years, while over 94 % of the farmers believe that amount of rainfall, duration, intensity and rainy days has decreased. Nearly 96 % of the farmers believe that their farms are extremely vulnerable to decreased rainfall, droughts and changed timing of rainfall events. Climatic data of the catchment indicates a rising trend in temperature but no long-term changes in annual and monthly rainfall, thereby possibly increasing levels of evapotranspiration. While no statistical differences were found between rain-fed and irrigation agricultural types regarding receipt of external support, their approaches to climatic change adaptation do differ. Patently, 94 and 90 % of farmers relying on rain-fed and irrigation strategies respectively receive some form of support, primarily via extension services. Farmers using rain-fed practices adjust to climate variability by varying crop types via rotation without fertilizer while farmers employing irrigation practices are more likely to offset climate variability with a greater use of fertilizer application. Conclusion: The Vea catchment faces rising temperature and evapotranspiration trends. Farmers are aware of these climatic changes and are adapting strategies to cope with the effects but require support. Adequate extension services and irrigation facilities are needed to assist farmers in order to sustain their livelihoods on the long run.",0.9874603525577299,0.13469295724531916,0.05594314214177658,0.6106153682703841,0.027423615683231407,0.00786790843408915,0.028325432552590447
Barriers to climate change adaptation: evidence from northeast Ghana in the context of a systematic literature review,"Despite the international significance attached to climate change adaptation, there remains a lack of understanding of the barriers that impede the effective implementation of adaptation strategies by households across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Better understanding of the vulnerability of agriculture-dependent households to climate variability requires exploration of the barriers that constrain the implementation of adaptation strategies. This paper uses case studies from northeast Ghana and a systematic literature review to assess the barriers that restrict effective implementation of climate adaptations in SSA. Results suggest that households are constrained by financial barriers, socio-cultural barriers, institutional barriers, technological barriers and a lack of information on climate change characteristics. We examine how the various barriers interact at different levels to influence the adaptation process. Findings highlight that the development of early warning systems, effective communication of climate information and an understanding of the local context within which adaptations take place, are necessary pre-requisites to enhance climate adaptations and rural livelihoods. Households need to be supported through the provision of micro-credit schemes, community empowerment and extension initiatives aimed at enhancing social networks within farming communities in order to reduce their vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change and variability.",0.5564335706291008,0.3087316966666789,0.11465441694780334,0.5335598496604741,0.15219743662459437,0.08402379456522031,0.09743054869335763
Changing livelihoods and protected area management: a case study of charcoal production in south-west Madagascar,"Protected areas are usually conceived and managed as static entities, although this approach is increasingly viewed as unrealistic given climate change and ecosystem dynamics. The ways in which people use land and/or natural resources within and around protected areas can also shift and evolve temporally but this remains an under-acknowledged challenge for protected area managers. Here we investigate the factors driving a rapid rise in charcoal production within a new, multiple-use protected area in Madagascar, to inform appropriate management responses. We conducted a questionnaire survey of 208 charcoal producers to ascertain the mix of livelihood activities they practised in 2010/2011 and 5 years previously. Respondents had diversified their livelihood activities over time, and cultivation and pastoralism had decreased as primary sources of revenue. Reasons for the growing reliance on charcoal production include the reduced viability of alternative livelihoods (primarily farming), as a result of changing rainfall patterns and the loss of irrigation infrastructure, as well as a growing need for cash to support themselves and their families. Our results suggest that charcoal production is not a desirable activity but a safety net when times are difficult. Conservation efforts to ameliorate underlying factors driving livelihood change, such as dam restoration, could reduce the prevalence of charcoal production, but simultaneous action to cut demand is also required. We recommend that mechanisms to detect, understand and respond to social change are integrated systematically into protected area management planning, alongside traditional biodiversity monitoring.",0.6248226887758722,0.29167054790414,0.15862521511097702,0.40896862598747796,0.0674805533626777,0.0412847754770958,0.06768390902499483
Climate Change and Rural Development in the Middle Atlas Mountains and Fringe Areas (Morocco),"In Morocco, studies on the relationship between climate change and rural development policies, especially in the mountains, are few and far between. This article takes a geopolitical approach to this particular issue in the Middle Atlas. Until the 1990s, rural development policies were based on the fight against forest degradation and soil erosion, first and foremost with a view to reducing dam silting. Since the early 2000s, efforts have focused on direct contact with the population in order to meet their needs. However, integration of the forestry sector into the agricultural system has not yielded the expected results. People, deeply concerned by the multifaceted impacts of climate change, have not been particularly receptive to sectoral proposals of projects related to forest heritage management. To address this concern, new development programs have been implemented and decentralised at the municipal level. Although projects still fall short of needs, the new approach to rural development is more territorial in terms of improving the resilience of populations to climate change at present and in the future.",0.4626688413684034,0.3175276200694683,0.1615072910781846,0.40383555970539425,0.07500551350914149,0.052462113030825264,0.09228269250137273
Climate change and variability: perception and adaptation strategies of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists across different zones of Burkina Faso,"Due to the dependence of its economy on rainfed agriculture and livestock husbandry, Burkina Faso, like other Sahelian countries, is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Adaptation is needed to counteract anticipated drawbacks of climate change on crop and livestock productivity; therefore, we examined climate change perceptions of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists and analysed their adaptation strategies. To this end, focus group discussions were held in six villages distributed across three agro-ecological zones. In three of these sites, 162 farmers were also individually interviewed. Perceptions of farmers were compared to actual trends of different climatic parameters extracted from official long-term meteorological records (1988-2008). Results showed that farmers in Burkina Faso were partly aware of climate change, particularly of changes in temperature and rainfall patterns, but their perception did not match well with the recorded annual rainfall data in the southern Sahelian and Sudanian zones. The most important adaptation strategies mentioned by agro-pastoralists were crop diversification, combination of cropping and livestock operations, use of water harvesting technologies and anti-erosive measures such as half-moons or stone dikes. Strategies of pastoralists included seasonal, annual and permanent migration and taking up of cereal cropping. Logistic regression analysis indicated that agro-ecological zone, cultivated surface, ruminant herd size, household size and education were the most important variables affecting farmers' choice of adaptation strategies. These factors should be taken into account in the development and implementation of any programme of adaptation to climate change in Burkina Faso.",0.9705272074498548,0.15825756555651302,0.079240927108394,0.6488290706732215,0.034346574263048574,0.011662881890084036,0.01607988213743231
Climate change impacts and adaptation in South Africa,"In this paper we review current approaches and recent advances in research on climate impacts and adaptation in South Africa. South Africa has a well-developed earth system science research program that underpins the climate change scenarios developed for the southern African region. Established research on the biophysical impacts of climate change on key sectors (water, agriculture, and biodiversity) integrates the climate change scenarios but further research is needed in a number of areas, such as the climate impacts on cities and the built environment. National government has developed a National Climate Change Response White Paper, but this has yet to translate into policy that mainstreams adaptation in everyday practice and longer-term planning in all spheres and levels of government. A national process to scope long-term adaptation scenarios is underway, focusing on cross-sectoral linkages in adaptation responses at a national level. Adaptation responses are emerging in certain sectors. Some notable city-scale and project-based adaptation responses have been implemented, but institutional challenges persist. In addition, a number of knowledge gaps remain in relation to the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change. A particular need is to develop South Africa's capacity to undertake integrated assessments of climate change that can support climate-resilient development planning. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Climate Smart Agriculture? Assessing the Adaptation Implications in Zambia,"We examine a set of potentially climate smart agricultural practices, including reduced tillage, crop rotation and legume intercropping, combined with the use of improved seeds and inorganic fertiliser, for their effects on maize yields in Zambia. We use panel data from the Rural Incomes and Livelihoods Surveys merged with a novel set of climatic variables based on geo-referenced historical rainfall and temperature data to explore the changing effects of these practices with climatic conditions. We estimate the impacts on maize yields, and also on the exhibition of very low yields and yield shortfalls from average levels, as indicators of resilience, while controlling for household characteristics. We find that minimum soil disturbance and crop rotation have no significant impact on these yield outcomes, but that legume intercropping significantly increases yields and reduces the probability of low yields even under critical weather stress during the growing season. We also find that the average positive impacts of modern input use (seeds and fertilisers) are significantly conditioned by climatic variables. Timely access to fertiliser emerges as one of the most robust determinants of yields and their resilience. These results have policy implications for targeted interventions to improve the productivity and the resilience of smallholder agriculture in Zambia in the face of climate change.",0.9304898682977468,0.1915969070069337,0.09533736148451058,0.44010488833030537,0.03461785222125785,0.01991360745160874,0.016083824036008578
Combining Sustainable Land Management Technologies to Combat Land Degradation and Improve Rural Livelihoods in Semi-arid Lands in Kenya,"Drylands occupy more than 80 % of Kenya's total land mass and contribute immensely to the national economy and society through agriculture, livestock production, tourism, and wild product harvesting. Dryland ecosystems are areas of high climate variability making them vulnerable to the threats of land degradation. Consequently, agropastoralists inhabiting these ecosystems develop mechanisms and technologies to cope with the impacts of climate variability. This study is aimed to; (1) determine what agropastoralists inhabiting a semi-arid ecosystem in Kenya attribute to be the causes and indicators of land degradation, (2) document sustainable land management (SLM) technologies being undertaken to combat land degradation, and (3) identify the factors that influence the choice of these SLM technologies. Vegetation change from preferred indigenous forage grass species to woody vegetation was cited as the main indicator of land degradation. Land degradation was attributed to recurrent droughts and low amounts of rainfall, overgrazing, and unsustainable harvesting of trees for fuelwood production. However, despite the challenges posed by climate variability and recurrent droughts, the local community is engaging in simple SLM technologies including grass reseeding, rainwater harvesting and soil conservation, and dryland agroforestry as a holistic approach combating land degradation and improving their rural livelihoods. The choice of these SLM technologies was mainly driven by their additional benefits to combating land degradation. In conclusion, promoting such simple SLM technologies can help reverse the land degradation trend, improve agricultural production, food security including access to food, and subsequently improve livelihoods of communities inhabiting dryland ecosystems.",0.9314337826638678,0.28481680066944626,0.14309853655689614,0.6465318910691139,0.022656777639270577,0.015203988301319348,0.07814717741337593
Crop diversification and livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe: adaptive management for environmental change,"This paper demonstrates how crop diversification impacts on two outcomes of climate smart agriculture; increased productivity (legume and cereal crop productivity) and enhanced resilience (household income, food security, and nutrition) in rural Zimbabwe. Using data from over 500 smallholder farmers, we jointly estimate crop diversification and each of the outcome variables within a conditional (recursive) mixed process framework that corrects for selectivity bias arising due to the voluntary nature of crop diversification. We find that crop diversification depends on the land size, farming experience, asset wealth, location, access to agricultural extension services, information on output prices, low transportation costs and general information access. Our results also indicate that an increase in the rate of adoption improves crop productivity, income, food security and nutrition at household level. Overall, our results are indicative of the importance of crop diversification as a viable climate smart agriculture practice that significantly enhances crop productivity and consequently resilience in rural smallholder farming systems. We, therefore, recommend wider adoption of diversified cropping systems notably those currently less diversified for greater adaptation to the ever-changing climate.",0.9800286415178693,0.13344160391857618,0.07137504331861999,0.7366193740712991,0.021913523909397194,0.012281235769774156,0.012579135511003444
Post-disaster Housing Reconstruction: The Impact of Resourcing in Post-cyclones Sidr and Aila in Bangladesh,"This study draws on structured interviews of 285 villagers and semi-structured interviews of 20 key stakeholders to investigate the effectiveness of resourcing for post-disaster housing reconstruction in Bangladesh. Through evaluating post-disaster housing reconstruction theories and approaches, the synthesis of literature and empirical fieldwork, this paper develops a dynamic theoretical framework that moves the trajectory of post-disaster housing reconstruction towards the construction of more resilient houses. The results of descriptive statistics, multiple regression and thematic analyses indicate that only 6 per cent of reconstructed houses could withstand cyclones, and access to resources played a pivotal role in post-Sidr and post-Aila housing reconstruction.

TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE CHINESE COASTAL MEGACITIES. A CASE STUDY OF PRACTICE IN THE PEARL RIVER DELTA,"This article analyses the current flood risk management practices in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. In the next four decades, 120 million people are expected to live in the region, which currently covers 11 major cities, and includes the coastal megacities formed by Hong Kong and Shenzhen. These populous low-lying coastal cities experience emerging flood risk from (i) intense precipitation, (ii) storm surges, (iii) global sea level rise and (iv) rapid urbanization in the flood-prone areas. These have major economic, social and ecological impacts and have made it imperative to adopt a sustainable flood risk management strategy to mitigate these risks. This research uses the case study in Tai O and Shenzhen River sites from Hong Kong and Shenzhen where in-depth discussions were held with various stakeholders to overview and understand current constraints to realizing sustainable flood risk management (SFRM). The outcome shows the authorities have realized the importance of SFRM and climate change adaptation strategies. They seek further improvement in managing flood risk and preparing for unpredictable climatic regimes in both megacities, and by extension comparable urbanizing coastal cities in the PRD and East Asia.

"Rebuilding pastoral social-ecological resilience on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in response to changes in policy, economics, and climate","Economic, policy, and climate changes have profoundly influenced pastoral social-ecological systems on the Tibetan Plateau. Climate change is believed to be leading to increasing extreme weather conditions such as snow disasters and droughts, putting a strain on the rangeland resources herders must have to increase income. Market-based economic reforms and interrelated development policies such as the Rangeland Household Contract Policy, the Ecological Construction Project, and herder settlement Initiatives have increased integration of pastoral regions into modern markets with promotion of tourism, expanded livestock markets, and marketing opportunities for rangeland resources. Although allocating common rangelands to households is the foundation of current rangeland management strategies to achieve these goals, it removes important technologies for coping with high variability in rangeland forage production from the traditional rangeland management portfolio on the Tibetan Plateau. These include shared risk, shared labor, seasonal and yearly herd mobility, and access to diverse areas of rangelands and multiple water sources. Field study of two villages in Guinan County of Qinghai Province, and Ruoergai County of Sichuan Province from 2011 to 2014 found that the villages responded to externally driven policy, economic, and climate changes with an innovative locally adapted quota-based grazing management system that preserves valuable management technologies, conserves rangeland resources, and provides individual opportunities for financial gain. In this way the village social-ecological system has exhibited considerable resiliency, maintaining a form of community governance that functions to manage the rangelands, improve well-being as indicated by livestock productivity, and, according to local perceptions, maintain rangeland condition. The community-based grazing quota system devised by the villages occupies a middle ground between common and individual models for resource use because it focuses more on how to equitably distribute services and utilities from rangelands, instead of how to distribute rangelands.",0.7627123833940764,0.3447046490210059,0.19090516192616178,0.4776009198909757,0.05458446461757671,0.03217465260264111,0.17998645599697694
"Finding the missing thread: The inclusion of a human rights-based approach in tackling climate change mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk reduction","The discussion on how to address climate change, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation, has paid scant attention to human rights. We argue that a human rights-based approach (HRBA) provides excellent tools towards a real positive change, including, but not limited to climate change. We compare four case studies and their national legal framework on disaster risk reduction (DRR): Brazil, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia and Nepal. The focus is on how human rights affect progress or lack of it in the advancement of DRR, climate change adaptation and climate change mitigation. We suggest that the mere existence of national legislation covering natural disasters may not be sufficient. Regardless of various ambitious policies on natural disasters if such basic issues like the human rights protection and empowerment of local community is missed, this will hamper the efficiency and effectiveness of efforts to reduce or manage disaster risk and climate change. We argue therefore for the inclusion of a HRBA in the post-Hyogo Framework of Action.",0.2690542086490741,0.4293559584642254,0.21400538230681745,0.28215100778582514,0.1083496136555947,0.1538480780116845,0.1901626152249811
"""Credit plus"" microcredit schemes: a key to women's adaptive capacity","This paper presents the provision of ""credit plus"" training activities, conditionally and jointly with microloans by Equity Bank and by Swedish non-governmental organization Vi-Skogen in the area of Kisumu, Kenya to women's groups as a key to improving women's capacity to adapt to climate change. Groups received training in small business administration and agroforestry, which produced positive outcomes or a virtuous spiral in their families' economy, well-being and in their intra-household bargaining power. In agroforestry and new farming practices, group training enhanced the women's set of planned adaptation strategies. In a context where formal financial institutions are still reluctant to provide credit to subsistence farmers, this case study shows the beneficial effects that credit would generate for women's adaptive capacity.",0.7728788085532285,0.2939036354264041,0.08631252866079504,0.60624637931873,0.034858169713816375,0.02994833713890643,0.07000764531908744
Adaptation in a multi-stressor environment: Perceptions and responses to climatic and economic risks by coffee growers in Mesoamerica,"While climate change adaptation policy has tended to focus on planned adaptation interventions, in many vulnerable communities, adaptation will consist of autonomous, ""unplanned"" actions by individuals who are responding to multiple simultaneous sources of change. Their actions are likely not only to affect their own future vulnerability, but, through changes in livelihoods and resource use, the vulnerability of their community and resource base. In this paper, we document the autonomous changes to livelihood strategies adopted by smallholder coffee farmers in four Mesoamerican countries (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica). Our aim is to gain insight into the process of autonomous adaptation by proxy: through an assessment of how farmers explain their choices in relation to distinct stressors; and an understanding of the set of choices available to farmers. We find that climatic stress is a feature in decision making, but not the dominant driver. Nevertheless, the farmers in our sample are evidently flexible, adaptive, and experimental in relation to changing circumstances. Whether their autonomous responses to diverse stressors will result in a reduction in risk over time may well depend on the extent to which policy, agricultural research, and rural investments build on the inherent logic of these strategies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",0.7776920621421083,0.3297521670008056,0.11744809779522739,0.4851078820494497,0.06356481072390961,0.052253478934359804,0.035256955399373735
How cities prepare for climate change: Comparing Hamburg and Rotterdam,"This paper compares the different ways in which the cities of Hamburg and Rotterdam are taking preemptive action to adapt to climate change. Literature, interviews, secondary data, official statistics, project reports and policy briefs were used to identify institutional arrangements used by the city governments to encourage innovations in climate adaptation strategies and involve the private sector in climate change policy implementation. We focus on cases that create positive opportunities; exploring how innovations are facilitated within the theoretical frameworks of the Porter hypothesis and eco-innovation. We examine two possible pathways of climate change governance, firstly strict regulation and formal enforcement, and secondly institutional eco-innovation and voluntary measures. We found that different emphasis is placed on the preferred pathway in each of the case studies. Hamburg focuses on formal enforcements while the Rotterdam city government encourages institutional eco-innovation by acting as a platform and also providing incentives. Our findings suggest that a well-designed institutional framework can enhance innovation and increase environmental and business performance. The framework could vary in instruments and patterns, using both formal constraints and incentives to increase voluntary actions to shape policy. The formal rules could be stringent or incentivising to shape the climate change measures. The research aims to contribute to both practice and science by providing examples that might motivate and inspire other cities to design appropriate institutions for climate change policy implementation.

Spatial Optimization of Future Urban Development with Regards to Climate Risk and Sustainability Objectives,"Future development in cities needs to manage increasing populations, climate-related risks, and sustainable development objectives such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Planners therefore face a challenge of multidimensional, spatial optimization in order to balance potential tradeoffs and maximize synergies between risks and other objectives. To address this, a spatial optimization framework has been developed. This uses a spatially implemented genetic algorithm to generate a set of Pareto-optimal results that provide planners with the best set of trade-off spatial plans for six risk and sustainability objectives: (i) minimize heat risks, (ii) minimize flooding risks, (iii) minimize transport travel costs to minimize associated emissions, (iv) maximize brownfield development, (v) minimize urban sprawl, and (vi) prevent development of greenspace. The framework is applied to Greater London (U.K.) and shown to generate spatial development strategies that are optimal for specific objectives and differ significantly from the existing development strategies. In addition, the analysis reveals tradeoffs between different risks as well as between risk and sustainability objectives. While increases in heat or flood risk can be avoided, there are no strategies that do not increase at least one of these. Tradeoffs between risk and other sustainability objectives can be more severe, for example, minimizing heat risk is only possible if future development is allowed to sprawl significantly. The results highlight the importance of spatial structure in modulating risks and other sustainability objectives. However, not all planning objectives are suited to quantified optimization and so the results should form part of an evidence base to improve the delivery of risk and sustainability management in future urban development.",0.2290476010770897,0.35534700609200964,0.09135659771574091,0.224428295499133,0.0731426370285694,0.3298811061634817,0.0901159091161285
Climate change and thermal comfort in Southern Europe housing: A case study from Lisbon,"The world has been experiencing a significant increase in daily average temperatures per decade and climate change scenarios are projecting high probability of more frequent heat waves. In vulnerable regions, like Southern Europe, where most of the residential buildings still rely on natural ventilation for cooling, impact on thermal comfort can be significant in terms of health, well-being and also energy consumption. The question is particularly important for the existing building stock, which was not designed considering the projected future climate conditions and is prone to be subjected to interventions with the purpose of improving thermal. performance. The study presents a vulnerability framework and methodology for the assessment of thermal comfort in existing dwellings in the context of climate change. Results relating to a 1960s typical building case study in Lisbon, Portugal, suggest that specific dwelling characteristics, such as orientation, and occupancy profiles are relevant when assessing vulnerability, suggesting significant differences, of up to 91% in discomfort hours on an annual basis. Furthermore, increased insulation seems to be effective in decreasing discomfort, as the best results (48% in discomfort hours decrease) stem from a context of external insulation for a heatwave situation. The methodology can be useful for assessing vulnerability in existing dwellings and its specific conditions. It can also contribute to understanding the effect of energy retrofitting measures in future climate conditions, assisting energy efficiency policies and decision-making regarding retrofit interventions.

Ecosystems-based adaptation: Are we being conned? Evidence from Mexico,"This paper scrutinises claims made about the promise and efficacy of ecosystems-based adaptation (EBA), through an exploration of EBA-relevant interventions in two fieldsites in Mexico. Our data starts to fill important gaps in current global debates about EBA. We find evidence of the important contribution of interventions relevant to EBA objectives at a small scale and under very specific conditions. However, the viability of similar interventions is substantially reduced, and arguably rendered null, as an incentive for conservation in a more populous fieldsites. Furthermore, evidence suggests that other adaptation options risked being overlooked if the context were viewed solely through the lens of EBA. We conclude that EBA needs to: a) engage with and address the trade-offs which characterised earlier attempts to integrate conservation and development, and; b) acknowledge the implications for its objectives of a globally predominant, neoliberal political economy.",0.4268313212844374,0.3168863382374893,0.27956307561286914,0.33977729865970746,0.16340474115373954,0.087238727695151,0.24925847465500886
"Human perceptions of, and adaptations to, shifting runoff cycles: A case-study of the Yellowstone River (Montana, USA)","Throughout the western United States, researchers have started documenting a trend toward earlier runoff, lower in-stream flows, and wanner-than-average water temperatures. These 'drought-like' stream conditions often lead to negative ecological, economic, and social consequences. To gain a deeper understanding of these emerging impacts, we focused our investigation on the Yellowstone River, which experienced a major drought event in 2016. This drought lead to an outbreak of Proliferative Kidney Disease that killed approximately 10,000 fish and resulted in an emergency closure of 294.5 km of the river for 15 days. We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with outfitters, guides, government researchers, and state fisheries biologists/managers working within the Yellowstone River watershed. Our work was guided by three objectives: 1) to determine if people perceive changes in the runoff cycle; 2) to identify the impacts of changing runoff; and 3) if impacts are occurring, to document what adaptations strategies are being used to address them. In our discussions, respondents described an earlier runoff, shorter and more intense runoff, and more interannual variability in runoff. The impacts respondents associated with these changes were: 1) increased uncertainty in yearly planning and fishing quality; 2) altered fishing quality; 3) changes in species distributions; 4) disease outbreaks; and 5) imposed fishing restrictions. Respondents also described the following adaptations to mitigate impacts: 1) altering catch-and-release practices; 2) temporally shifting trips; 3) spatially shifting trips; 4) drought anticipation; and 5) targeting warm water species.",0.5768822775023101,0.35680747823795156,0.2021856162731586,0.2816341593899503,0.12637633317481117,0.12350582607047153,0.23357087380523175
"Brazil, Ethiopia, and New Zealand lead the way on climate-smart agriculture","As countries around the world face urgent agricultural challenges, the concept of 'climate-smart' agriculture (CSA) has been put forward to achieve climate change adaptation, mitigation, and food security synergistically. A new report explores how three countries are using integrated policy approaches to CSA and offers insights for how other countries can build CSA into their policy mix. Brazil has invested in research to support sustainable intensification while creating legal and enforcement mechanisms to protect forest areas as a response to unrestrained agricultural expansion driven by market demand. Ethiopia initiated innovative participatory watershed development programs, in partnership with numerous international institutions, which helped smallholder farmers to rehabilitate marginal land and break out of a poverty cycle. New Zealand has removed agricultural subsidies while partnering on research and development with the private sector as a way to ensure efficiency and resilience in an agricultural sector influenced by climate change and international trade dynamics. To assemble an integrated set of national policies that fosters CSA, governments will need context-specific assessments, strong multi-stakeholder institutions, coordination frameworks, and multi-scale information systems. Governments can select from an array of policy instruments ranging from regulatory mechanisms and economic incentives to public investments and educational campaigns. Many existing national policy goals and public programs designed to increase agricultural production, improve livelihoods, and reduce environmental risks can become important pillars of a national CSA strategy. Countries have obvious interests in fostering an agriculture sector that is climate-resilient, provides national needs for food, fiber, and fuel, and supports farm livelihoods. However, the incentives for national-level action toward reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) levels are less clear in the absence of serious and shared international commitment. Integrated national CSA policies will be encouraged by clear, consistent signals from multilateral agencies, global donors, and international conventions and trade agreements that promote agriculture as a pathway for poverty reduction and food security. © 2014 Negra et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",0.6688906148321817,0.2937786784414318,0.19797533698970352,0.4824671419208611,0.06394004415882436,0.06192956680237666,0.04845464202929729
Is conservation agriculture 'climate-smart' for maize farmers in the highlands of Tanzania?,"Conservation agriculture (CA) is promoted extensively to increase the productivity and environmental sustainability of maize production systems across sub-Saharan Africa and is often listed as a climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practice. However, the impacts of CA on food security, resilience/adaptive capacity and climate change mitigation are location-dependent and it is unknown whether CA can simultaneously address CSA's multiple objectives. Here we evaluate four variations of CA: reduced tillage plus mulch (mulch), reduced tillage plus mulch and leguminous cover crop (Lablab), reduced tillage plus mulch and leguminous trees (CAWT), and reduced tillage plus mulch and nitrogen fertilizer (CA + F)-for their effect on CSA-relevant outcomes in highland Tanzania maize production. By comparison to conventional practice in the region, intensification of maize production by Lablab, CAWT, and CA + F significantly increases yields by 40, 89 and 77 %, respectively. Likewise, rainfall use efficiency was highest in these three treatments and significantly greater than conventional practices in 7 of 12 comparisons. Seasonal and annual greenhouse gas fluxes were similar across all treatments; however, yield-scaled global warming potential (Mg CO2 eq Mg grain(-1)) was lower in CAWT (2.1-3.1) and CA ? F (1.9-2.3) than conventional practice (1.9-8.3), averaging 62 and 68 % of the emission intensity of conventional practice, respectively. The findings demonstrate that CA can deliver benefits consistent with the objectives of CSA for farmers in this region, particularly when soil nitrogen limitation is alleviated, providing other constraints to adoption are removed.",0.9370884463114871,0.1876743589622369,0.0823714060488234,0.5,0.030653129439845578,0.026128811843048935,0.026438731146776435
Reducing vulnerability of rain-fed agriculture to drought through indigenous knowledge systems in north-eastern Ghana,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze how fanners are reducing vulnerability of rain-fed agriculture to drought through indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) in the Atankwidi basin, north-eastern Ghana. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on combined qualitative and quantitative research methods and data. First, the paper draws on qualitative data generated from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions from purposively sampled farmers in the Atankwidi basin. It also draws on a survey conducted on 131 systematically and randomly sampled households in three communities of the basin, namely Yua, Pungu and Mirigu. Findings - The results show that farmers are planting multiple indigenous drought resilient crop varieties and employing different rounds of seeding and or staggering planting between multiple farms. They are also applying indigenous forms of organic manure, checking soil erosion through grass strips and stone terracing and adopting paddy farming for improving soil and water conservation towards enhancing plant adaptation to drought. The paper therefore, asserts that through conscientious effort, farmers are reducing vulnerability of rain-fed agriculture to drought through indigenous knowledge systems of drought risk management. Practical implications - The paper recommends that capacity for managing vulnerability to drought at the local level, including the Atankwidi basin, can be enhanced by incorporating as into District Development Planning (DDP) and giving priority to the strategic role of IKS in climate change adaptation planning. Originality/value - This paper fulfills a need for researching the relevance of IKS for reducing vulnerability of rain-fed agriculture to drought in particular, and enhancing adaptation to climate. change in general in the quest for promoting Endogenous Development (ED) in Africa.",0.8998998665334267,0.24646817846171692,0.10024037704704607,0.5168932342086773,0.035056891261474425,0.03573993026503213,0.19769318911807263
Yield response of maize (Zea mays L.) to conservation agriculture cropping system in Southern Africa,"The effect of different conservation agriculture (CA) systems on maize grain yield was studied across four countries in southern Africa. Maize yield data was obtained from plots under no-tillage as well as from conventionally tilled plots. Crop residues were retained in no-till plots, whereas they were removed from conventional tillage plots in line with current farmer practices. Rotations or intercropping systems with grain legumes were introduced at all sites. Fertiliser treatments were uniform across tillage treatments at each trial location but varied across countries, based on local fertilizer recommendations. Focus group discussions were conducted with farmers in the study sites to understand the constraints related to the successful integration of CA into the farming systems and to document farmers' perceptions about CA. In the majority of cases (80%), yield responses from a range of CA systems were greater than those of the conventional control plot at the respective site. In 20% of the cases there was a negative response to CA, due to lack of experience by farmers in the initial year, slow increase in soil fertility at the respective site and waterlogging in some years with too much rainfall. Yield advantages on two manual CA systems, planted with a dibble stick with sole maize and maize-legume intercropping in Malawi were 1152 kg ha(-1) and 1172 kg ha(-1), respectively. Animal traction CA systems had slightly smaller yield benefits (458 kg ha(-1) on a ripline seeded system and 761 kg ha(-1) on an animal traction direct seeding systems) as compared to a ploughed control treatment. Yield benefits increased with increasing years of practicing CA, highlighting the need to gain experience to master critical management steps such as timely planting, weeding, fertiliser application and crop harvest residue management. Yields from CA system responded better to increasing clay and silt content in the top soil and were more resilient to seasonal rainfall variability than conventional control treatments. Results suggest that the niche for CA in southern Africa is larger than expected although rainfalls regimes below 600 mm are challenging to sustain large maize biomass production to provide effective soil cover in CA systems. The success of CA implementation will largely depend on addressing critical challenges observed in the field, which will need adaptation of CA system to the site and farmer circumstances.

Responding to Crop Failure: Understanding Farmers' Coping Strategies in Southern Malawi,"Malawi is a country in southern Africa facing high climate variability and many agricultural challenges. This paper examines farmers' coping strategies for crop failure and the determinants of their choices using household level data from rural southern Malawi. The results highlight that farmers are not responding directly to climate variability, but to crop failure, which is influenced by climate stress, as well as other constraints, such as poor soil fertility and lack of agricultural inputs and technologies. The coping strategies adopted by households are mostly ex-post measures, including engaging in casual labor, small businesses and the sale of forest products. The main determinants of the adoption of these coping options are education, gender of the head of household, soil fertility and frequency of crop failure. This study concludes by recommending, among other things, that policies for the more efficient communication of climate change threats should emphasize the risk of crop failure. Furthermore, initiatives to assist households to better cope with climate change should take into consideration the local context of decision-making which is shaped by multiple stressors.",0.9294785108748161,0.19421468956905008,0.06985179404924215,0.6737985433173139,0.020472012277095143,0.025563569570925464,0.04831819680363185
"Fishers' perceptions of climate change, impacts on their livelihoods and adaptation strategies in environmental change hotspots: a case of Lake Wamala, Uganda","Fisheries resources support livelihoods of fishing communities but are threatened by over-exploitation, habitat degradation, pollution, invasive species and climate change. Unlike the other threats, climate change has received limited consideration and reducing its risks requires appropriate adaptation strategies. This study used quantitative and qualitative methods to generate knowledge on fishers' perceptions of climate change, changes in climate variables and their impacts on livelihoods, adaptation strategies, constraints to adaptation and required interventions to promote adaptation strategies that would enable fishers to build resilience to sustain their livelihoods. We found that fishers were aware of changes in climate conditions manifested by unpredictable seasons, floods and droughts. Fishing remained the main livelihood activity. However, the dominance of fishes had changed from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) to the African catfish (Clarias gariepinus Burchell). Floods and droughts were associated with damage to gears, boats, landing sites and changes in fish catches and sizes, income from fishing and fish consumption. The fishers adapted by increasing time on fishing grounds and changing target species and fishing gear among other things. Some innovative fishers diversified to high-value crops and livestock. This increased their income beyond what was solely earned from fishing which provided an incentive for some of them to quit fishing. Livelihood diversification was enhanced by use of communications technology, membership of social groups, increasing fishing days and fishing experience. Adaptation was, however, constrained by limited credit, awareness and access to land, which require interventions such as improving access to credit, irrigation facilities, appropriate planting materials and awareness raising. We identified adaptation strategies, which if promoted and their constraints addressed, could increase resilience of fishers to the influence of climate change and sustain their livelihoods.",0.918246465460783,0.27601743706923165,0.08428468010751258,0.6472688658703145,0.28337652546288866,0.015545628646144113,0.0236015886574764
The influence of gendered roles and responsibilities on the adoption of technologies that mitigate drought risk: The case of drought-tolerant maize seed in eastern Uganda,"Gender-disaggregated, household survey data for Uganda are used to examine how gendered roles and responsibilities influence adoption of drought-tolerant (DT) maize, a new technology that can help smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa adapt to drought risk. Multinomial logit (MNL) regression results indicate that, compared to men farmers, women farmers have much lower adoption of DT maize, mainly due to differences in resource access, notably land, agricultural information, and credit. Differentiation of women and men farmers by various characteristics reveals that whether a male farmer was younger or older, or poor or non-poor has no significant influence on DT maize adoption; but important differences among different categories of women farmers are identified. For example, the farmer group found least likely to adopt DT maize is young, poor women household heads. MNL results also show that wives strongly influence adoption of DT maize on plots controlled by their husbands. We discuss the implications of study findings for the development of well-targeted and socially-inclusive adaptation policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Navigating complexity through knowledge coproduction: Mainstreaming ecosystem services into disaster risk reduction,"Achieving the policy and practice shifts needed to secure ecosystem services is hampered by the inherent complexities of ecosystem services and their management. Methods for the participatory production and exchange of knowledge offer an avenue to navigate this complexity together with the beneficiaries and managers of ecosystem services. We develop and apply a knowledge coproduction approach based on social-ecological systems research and assess its utility in generating shared knowledge and action for ecosystem services. The approach was piloted in South Africa across four case studies aimed at reducing the risk of disasters associated with floods, wildfires, storm waves, and droughts. Different configurations of stakeholders (knowledge brokers, assessment teams, implementers, and bridging agents) were involved in collaboratively designing each study, generating and exchanging knowledge, and planning for implementation. The approach proved useful in the development of shared knowledge on the sizable contribution of ecosystem services to disaster risk reduction. This knowledge was used by stakeholders to design and implement several actions to enhance ecosystem services, including new investments in ecosystem restoration, institutional changes in the private and public sector, and innovative partnerships of science, practice, and policy. By bringing together multiple disciplines, sectors, and stakeholders to jointly produce the knowledge needed to understand and manage a complex system, knowledge coproduction approaches offer an effective avenue for the improved integration of ecosystem services into decision making.",0.4407964151525085,0.3446909350604587,0.14650445513318716,0.24909617190535843,0.1353648181491545,0.14269481999898434,0.08439057505272093
Is Sustainable Adaptation Possible? Determinants of Adaptation on Mount Kilimanjaro,"Adaptation is increasingly planned and funded to reduce negative impacts of climate change for vulnerable social groups; however, vulnerable groups have the least capacity to adapt. Adaptation is therefore unlikely to produce socially sustainable or equitable outcomes. Six adaptation processes on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, are modeled with logistic regression to identify their determinant factors. Most adaptations simply reproduce unsustainable patterns of social vulnerability rooted in unequal access to land and other resource entitlements. A few exceptions are observed, where low costs, widely accessible knowledge, and community groups with cross-scale social networks enabled vulnerable social groups to implement adaptations.",0.5925616412048142,0.40863156195048944,0.11529424013120904,0.4779762465903766,0.13180250229051424,0.08512681738082532,0.085900458571307
Investigating Climate Compatible Development Outcomes and their Implications for Distributive Justice: Evidence from Malawi,"Governments and donors are investing in climate compatible development in order to reduce climate and development vulnerabilities. However, the rate at which climate compatible development is being operationalised has outpaced academic enquiry into the concept. Interventions aiming to achieve climate compatible development ""wins"" (for development, mitigation, adaptation) can also create negative side-effects. Moreover, benefits and negative side-effects may differ across time and space and have diverse consequences for individuals and groups. Assessments of the full range of outcomes created by climate compatible development projects and their implications for distributive justice are scarce. This article develops a framework using a systematic literature review that enables holistic climate compatible development outcome evaluation over seven parameters identified. Thereafter, we explore the outcomes of two donor-funded projects that pursue climate compatible development triple-wins in Malawi using this framework. Household surveys, semi-structured interviews and documentary material are analysed. Results reveal that uneven outcomes are experienced between stakeholder groups and change over time. Although climate compatible development triple-wins can be achieved through projects, they do not represent the full range of outcomes. Ecosystem-and community-based activities are becoming popularised as approaches for achieving climate compatible development goals. However, findings suggest that a strengthened evidence base is required to ensure that these approaches are able to meet climate compatible development goals and further distributive justice.",0.33284147222116506,0.36749310238361615,0.1321204210147554,0.4169708045584157,0.1459634226923181,0.10622327861909468,0.08566966496839581
Raising awareness about climate change in Pacific communities,"Community-based climate change projects in the Pacific typically seek to raise the awareness of locals about the consequences of climate change and changing weather patterns. A key concern is that such activities might be done in an ad hoc manner, with little consideration of local relevance, audience and the integration of local experiences and knowledge. Drawing on the results gleaned from an interactive focus group with 10 climate change practitioners working in the region, this exploratory study investigates why raising awareness about climate change remains crucial, and importantly, how such activities might be done in a more relevant, meaningful and empowering way at the community level in the Pacific. This commentary argues that it is essential for communities to make local sense of climate change, particularly in an ever-changing world where knowledge is continuously expanding and changing. Initial findings suggest that making local sense of and raising awareness about climate change readily comes about with due consideration of approach, audience and context.",0.425464368305734,0.41858067276801364,0.16660655376810082,0.36215126567472417,0.09679361912028384,0.05834740397814105,0.24384597011039597
Is cross-breeding with indigenous sheep breeds an option for climate-smart agriculture?,"Climate-smart agriculture aims to improve food security by increasing productivity and producer incomes, strengthening resilience to climate change, and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For the livestock sector, improved genetics is often identified as a climate-smart option. While there is evidence in commercial systems that improved genetics is effective, extensive livestock systems in marginal environments have received less attention. This study in Mongolia compares flocks of two indigenous breeds: flocks of pure Mongol breed and flocks of Mongol-Barga breed crosses. It finds that cross-breeding can increase productivity (measured by live weight of animals) and improve adaptation to winter cold (measured by reductions in weight loss during winter-spring), while not increasing the intensity of GHG emissions (measured as kg CO(2)e emitted per kg live weight marketed) (p<0.05). The effects of crossbreeding on GHG emissions are strongly dependent on the structure of flocks and off-take. Productivity and winter adaptation are significantly improved for the cross-bred flocks compared to pure Mongol flocks (p<0.05), but management practices also have a significant impact. Programs to promote climate smart practices in extensive livestock systems should adopt an integrated approach combining improved animal management and marketing with breeding activities, rather than promoting single practices, such as cross-breeding with indigenous breeds.

"Livestock population dynamics and pastoral communities’ adaptation to rainfall variability in communal lands of Kgalagadi South, Botswana","Rainfall variability is a problem in arid environments, and in this study, drought severity, impact of rainfall variability on livestock population and adaptation practices were investigated in Kgalagadi, Botswana. Data from the Department of Meteorological Services, Central Statistics Office and a structured questionnaire were collected and analysed. Kgalagadi district is highly vulnerable to recurring mild droughts. The livestock population, particularly the goat population, thus tends to be positively associated with mean annual precipitation. Though cattle also responded positively to mean annual rainfall, the relationship was not statistically significant and this could be due to the buffering impact of management practices. Pastoral farmers’ adaptation practices included destocking, supplementation and mobility. The current grazing policy which promotes fencing could therefore increase the pastoral farmers’ vulnerability to droughts, as it limits mobility. © 2014, Kgosikoma and Batisani.; licensee springer.",0.9332987663341112,0.21193309076583716,0.0598067946538676,0.5267574570771474,0.03668564380432633,0.01784671868088467,0.04477463068029962
Genetic Adaptation vs. Ecophysiological Plasticity of Photosynthetic-Related Traits in Young Picea glauca Trees along a Regional Climatic Gradient,"Assisted population migration (APM) is the intentional movement of populations within a species range to sites where future environmental conditions are projected to be more conducive to growth. APM has been proposed as a proactive adaptation strategy to maintain forest productivity and to reduce the vulnerability of forest ecosystems to projected climate change. The validity of such a strategy will depend on the adaptation capacity of populations, which can partially be evaluated by the ecophysiological response of different genetic sources along a climatic gradient. This adaptation capacity results from the compromise between (i) the degree of genetic adaptation of seed sources to their environment of origin and (ii) the phenotypic plasticity of functional trait which can make it possible for transferred seed sources to positively respond to new growing conditions. We examined phenotypic variation in morphophysiological traits of six seed sources of white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) along a regional climatic gradient in Quebec, Canada. Seedlings from the seed sources were planted at three forest sites representing a mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient of 2.2 degrees C. During the second growing season, we measured height growth (H2014) and traits related to resources use efficiency and photosynthetic rate (A(max)). All functional traits showed an adaptive response to the climatic gradient. Traits such as H2014, A(max), stomatal conductance (g(s)), the ratio of mesophyll to stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency showed significant variation in both physiological plasticity due to the planting site and seed source variation related to local genetic adaptation. However, the amplitude of seed source variation was much less than that related to plantation sites in the area investigated. The six seed sources showed a similar level of physiological plasticity. H2014, A(max) and gs, but not carboxylation capacity (V-cmax), were correlated and decreased with a reduction of the average temperature of the growing season at seed origin. The clinal variation in H2014 and A(max) appeared to be driven by CO2 conductance. The presence of locally adapted functional traits suggests that the use of APM may have advantages for optimizing seed source productivity in future local climates.",0.6954654676155058,0.27295220979212487,0.13877728258136152,0.36794807437658283,0.046203159103521955,0.042030451793855186,0.05352203629184248
Managing soil fertility to adapt to rainfall variability in smallholder cropping systems in Zimbabwe,"Adaptation options that address short-term climate variability are likely to lead to short-term benefits and will help to deal with future changes in climate in smallholder cropping systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In this study we combined field experimentation and long-term rainfall analyses in Makoni and Hwedza districts in eastern Zimbabwe to evaluate cropping adaptation options to climate variability. Analyses of long-term rainfall data closely supports farmers' perceptions that the mean annual total rainfall has not changed, but the pattern of rainfall within-season has changed: the number of rainfall days has decreased, and the frequency of dry spells has increased at the critical flowering stage of maize. On-farm experiments were conducted over two cropping seasons, 2009/10 and 2010/11 to assess the effects of planting date, fertilization and cultivar on maize production. Three maize cultivars were sown in each of the early, normal and late planting windows defined by farmers. Each of the nine cultivar-planting date combinations received N, P. K and manure combinations at either zero, low or high fertilization rates. Overall, there were no significant differences in maize development or grain yield among cultivars. Maize grain yield was increased by increasing the amount of nutrients applied. Average yield was 2.5 t ha(-1) for the low rate and 5.0 t ha(-1) for the high rate on early planted cultivars on relatively fertile soils in Makoni in 2009/10 season. Yields on poorer soils in Hwedza were small, averaging 1.5 t ha(-1) for the low rate and 2.5 t ha(-1) for the high rate. Maize grain yields for the early and normal planted cultivars were similar for each fertilization rate, suggesting there is a wide planting window for successful establishment of crops in response to increased rainfall variability. Yield reduction of >50% was observed when planting was delayed by 4 weeks (late planting) regardless of the amount of fertilizer applied. Soil nutrient management had an overriding effect on crop production, suggesting that although the quality of within-season rainfall is decreasing, nutrient management is the priority option for adaptation in rain-fed smallholder cropping systems.

Climate risk management in river-based tilapia cage culture in northern Thailand,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse how fish farmers manage climate-related risks and explore possible ways to strengthen risk management under current and future climate. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 662 fish farmers in sites across Northern Thailand were interviewed about risks to the profitability of their fish farms and ways such risks were managed. Nonlinear canonical correlation analysis was used to relate risk factors to management practices at farm and river levels. In total, 68 in-depth interviews with farmers and other stakeholders provided additional information on climate risk management practices. Findings - Farmers use a combination of adjustments to rearing practices, cropping calendars and financial and social measures to manage those risks, which they perceive as being manageable. Many risks are season, river and place specific; implying that the risk profiles of individual farms can vary substantially. Individual risks are often addressed through multiple practices and strategies; conversely, a particular management practice can have a bearing on several different risks. Farmers recognize that risks must be managed at farm and higher spatial and administrative scales. Social relations and information play critical roles in managing these complex combinations of risks. Originality/value - This is one of the first papers to report in detail on how inland fish farmers manage climate-related risks. It underlines the need to consider multiple spatial and temporal scales and that farmers do not manage individual climate-related risks in isolation from other risks.",0.8970408949293992,0.2552677003445034,0.10071944062793933,0.33179576602100375,0.050272420928862076,0.05760776731194154,0.032494434639372995
The use of Ecosystem-based Adaptation practices by smallholder farmers in Central America,"There is growing interest in promoting the use of Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) practices to help smallholder farmers adapt to climate change, however there is limited information on how commonly these practices are used by smallholder farmers and what factors influence their use. Using participatory mapping and field surveys, we examined the prevalence and characteristics of EbA practices on 300 smallholder coffee and maize farmers in six landscapes in Central America and explored the socioeconomic and biophysical factors associated with their use. The prevalence of individual EbA practices varied across smallholder farms. Common EbA practices included live fences, home gardens, shade trees in coffee plantations, and dispersed trees in maize fields. We found a mean of 3.8 EbA practices per farm. Factors that were correlated with the total number of EbA practices on farms included the mean area of coffee plantations, farmer age, farmer experience, the farm type and the landscape in which farms were located. Factors associated with the presence or characteristics of individual EbA practices included the size of coffee plantations, farmer experience, farmer education, land tenure, landscape and farm type. Our analysis suggests that many smallholder farmers in Central America are already using certain EbA practices, but there is still scope for greater implementation. Policy makers, donors and technicians can encourage the broader use of EbA by smallholder farmers by facilitating fanner-to-farmer exchanges to share knowledge on EbA implementation, assessing the effectiveness of EbA practices in delivering adaptation benefits, and tailoring EbA policies and programs for smallholder farmers in different socioeconomic and biophysical contexts.",0.9332500469685818,0.1853945992244755,0.16766049643811876,0.4780296468468977,0.06944226550191711,0.02988643531115758,0.06236696547206484
Waterbird communities adjust to climate warming according to conservation policy and species protection status,"Climate change is one of the strongest biodiversity threats. Worse still, the impact of multiple anthropic stressors on species dynamics could complicate adaptation to temperature increase. International conservation policies aim to protect ecosystems against anthropic pressures, but their ability to facilitate adaptation to climate change has yet to be assessed. Using wetland bird monitoring surveys, we evaluated the differences at the country scale of community adjustment to temperature increase of wintering waterbird communities (145 species) according to the implementation of the two main western Palearctic international conservation policies (Bern Convention and Birds Directive) in the Mediterranean basin (2786 sites, 22 countries) over a 22-year period. We showed that thermic community composition increases over time in countries which have enforced conservation policies. We found that strictly protected species under the Birds Directive and the Bern Convention contributed more to this community adjustment than the not strictly protected species. The mechanism results from a population increase in protected warm-dwelling species but not from a decline in cold-dwelling species. This study supports the ability of international conservation policies to mitigate the effect of climate change on animal communities.",0.5282766169201497,0.3103735325156734,0.2590731274540094,0.3169360547231154,0.07206191134511604,0.06515002027849237,0.10177492784861418
"Flood management in cities of developing countries: the example of Ibadan, Nigeria","Flooding, a common environmental hazard worldwide has, in recent times, increased as a result of climate change, with the effect felt more by the poor in developing countries. In Nigeria, as in most developing countries, flooding has been linked to natural causes, urbanisation and poor management practices. It has resulted to loss of lives, income, property damage and spread of diseases. The recurrent incidences of flooding and associated risks in cities of developing countries have necessitated a review of the approaches to flood risk management in Nigeria. This paper takes a look at the incidence of flooding in Ibadan, a major city in Nigeria. It examines its causes, effects and the effectiveness of the flood management options. The study found that even with daunting challenges of financial constraints, mismanagement, lack of continuity in governance and policy, and small-scale flood management remedies, such as proper waste management, dredging, clearing of channels and bridge throughway, have proven effective in the management of flood risks. The study recommends an intensification of non-structural strategies of flood management.",0.21967293806863158,0.33561486656613926,0.1511708662383621,0.25994834697655,0.11773766888703631,0.5948472284322154,0.8113412890293883
Flood protection for the City of Beira: An exemplary climate adaptation project in Mozambique,"A new tidal outlet is now protecting the port city on Mozambique's Indian Ocean coast with a population of approximately half a million people, and improving the city's drainage. Since the Indian Ocean in this area has a very large tidal range of up to 7 m, reliable coastal protection is of great importance. The Chiveve tidal river, which runs through the city for a distance of approx. 5 km, was neglected in the past, and became increasingly silted up, to the point that it no longer served as a drainage channel for the surrounding area. The standing water promoted the spreading of diseases such as malaria and cholera. During very high tides or storm surges in the adjacent ocean, combined with heavy rainfall, the Chiveve regularly overflowed its banks and flooded much of its catchment area - particularly the informal settlements along its banks. To address this problem, Inros Lackner designed a new tidal outlet and flood barrier to protect Beira's city centre. The project also included a comprehensive plan for the reestablishment of the original river course and renaturation measures along its embankments. This included excavation of the river, dredging of sludge within the fishing port downstream, resettlement measures, and planting of young mangroves along the river banks.",0.19908220104876337,0.3458930785242668,0.17243101646111156,0.20603874649299309,0.0905266482217664,0.40977304473377174,0.26973483764079703
Where the rain falls: Evidence from 8 countries on how vulnerable households use migration to manage the risk of rainfall variability and food insecurity,"Up to present, research relating environmental change to human mobility has found out that environmental factors can play a role in migration without being conclusive. Further, in the context of climate change, scholarly literature on migration ranges across a host of climatic stressors and geographies, making it difficult to date to solve the debate whether migration is a form of adaptation or an indicator of limits to adaptation. To address both of these debates, original research was undertaken to answer the question 'under what circumstances do households (HHs) use migration as a risk management strategy when facing rainfall variability and food insecurity?'. This research administered a HH survey (n = 1300) and participatory research (n = 2000 respondents) in districts in eight countries (Guatemala, Peru, Ghana, Tanzania, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, and Vietnam). The findings reveal that the answer to how climatic stressors affect migration decisions and the degree to which migration improves the adaptive capacity of those HHs lie in the vulnerability of the HH and its sensitivity to climatic factors. The data reveal for the first time in a comparable global study distinct HH profiles of 'resilience' and 'vulnerability'. At the same time, the article distinguishes between 'content' migration - rather associated with resilient HHs - and 'erosive' migration - rather associated with vulnerable HHs. However, the article also highlights that there are not always clear cuts but very often grey areas and overlaps among the HHs of the study when applying these typologies. Moreover, the article relates these profiles to an agent-based modelling approach applied in the Tanzania case to explore under what scenarios rainfall variability and food security have the potential to become significant drivers of human mobility in particular regions of the world in the next two to three decades.",0.36424509920882253,0.4011220260575375,0.07286486166889303,0.6450238782087242,0.13301897314391398,0.07899600309198496,0.06633251473363357
"Micro hydropower: an alternative for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and development of marginalized local communities in Hispaniola Island","In this essay, we explore the contribution of establishing off-grid community micro-hydropower systems in the Dominican Republic to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Forty-five micro-hydropower systems were set up over 16 years that are sustainably and autonomously managed by the local groups and provide access to electricity to communities in remote areas while reducing CO2 emissions and favoring carbon sequestration. In addition to mitigating climate change by avoiding emissions and reforestation of more than 28,000 t of CO2 per year, these initiatives have improved the adaptive capacity of the local communities through contributing to biodiversity protection, climate policy development, and governance; as well as enhancing the wellbeing of families through increased savings, improved education, and increased income generation opportunities. We elaborate the key factors for success and considerations for meeting future challenges.",0.43096101722440316,0.35494589065462795,0.13155106487538937,0.36559202336679736,0.09096186231247942,0.08512676917677037,0.09043367039812407
Options for water storage and rainwater harvesting to improve health and resilience against climate change in Africa,"West and East Africa experience high variability of rainfall that is expected to increase with climate change. This results in fluctuations in water availability for food production and other socioeconomic activities. Water harvesting and storage can mitigate the adverse effects of rainfall variability. But past studies have shown that when investments in water storage are not guided by environmental health considerations, the increased availability of open water surface may increase the transmission of water-related diseases. This is demonstrated for schistosomiasis associated with small reservoirs in Burkina Faso, and for malaria in Ethiopia around large dams, small dams, and water harvesting ponds. The concern is that the rush to develop water harvesting and storage for climate change adaptation may increase the risk for already vulnerable people, in some cases more than canceling out the benefits of greater water availability. Taking health issues into account in a participatory approach to planning, design, and management of rainwater harvesting and water storage, as well as considering the full range of water storage options would enable better opportunities for enhancing resilience against climate change in vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa.",0.722506367125591,0.22440723626303702,0.1374206755356246,0.30568798218633697,0.021763380856025624,0.06765868718418043,0.8472874823007952
Climate-Change Adaptation in Ethiopia: To What Extent Does Social Protection Influence Livelihood Diversification?,"Social-protection programmes like the Productive Safety-Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia can play a positive role in promoting livelihoods and enhancing risk management. This article uses propensity score matching to estimate its effect on income diversification. The results suggest that receiving transfers from the PSNP, on average, did not increase farm or non-farm income but significantly increases natural-resource extraction (one component of off-farm income). While these results should be treated with caution, they suggest that the PSNP may not be helping smallholders diversify income sources in a positive manner for climate adaptation. The article concludes by arguing for the promotion of positive forms of income diversification and the further investigation of the PSNP's influence on autonomous adaptation strategies.",0.8142862286236844,0.33910665981634835,0.13406983820679624,0.4932550370411858,0.08074823666560481,0.05575576304204484,0.058997556598351056
"The role of formal and informal institutions in smallholder agricultural adaptation: The case of lawra and nandom districts, Ghana","As the current frequency of climate impacts is expected to increase in semi-arid regions of Ghana, smallholder farmers will require access to new and relevant information to adapt successfully. Institutional support is increasingly gaining attention for effective and successful adaptation; however, there is limited knowledge on the specific roles of both formal and informal organizations in implementing adaptation strategies in semi-arid regions. Using the Lawra and Nandom Districts as case studies, the various roles of existing institutions in adaptation strategies were examined. A total of 135 household questionnaires, six focus group discussions (FGDs), 20 in-depth interviews with farmers, and seven key informant interviews from institutions evaluated climate risks and impacts, adaptation responses of farmers and the functions of the different institutions in supporting these adaptation strategies. Majority of respondents observed that irregular and unpredictable rainfall (77%), high temperature and extreme heat (56%) and rainfall irregularities during growing season (55%) as the main changes in the past 10 years. Major agricultural adaptation strategies identified were changing of planting dates (100%), planting of different varieties of the same crop (51%), planting of trees (35%) and seasonal migration by the local farmers (21%). There is high dependence by the smallholder farmers on formal institutions’ resources to adapt, especially for developing/ building the local capacity, rather than on local innovations within the communities. This is mainly due to the lack of knowledge about climate change risks and adaptation strategies and limited or no access to financial resources. Government-led adaptation is considered to be more sustainable than NGO-led programmes although it comparatively lacks specific mandates and financial resources. Continued support by formal institutions will therefore enable the development of more effective agricultural adaptation initiatives. © 2018, Ecological Laboratory.

The role of perception in subsistence farmer adaptation in Africa Enriching the climate finance debate,"Purpose - Africa is a focus area for international climate change adaptation finance. Subsistence farmers are crucial for Africa's adaption. But it is unclear how those that qualify to receive adaptation finance actually perceive climate change, even though perceptions are reflected in adaptive behaviour. This paper aims to show how perceptions of climate-related hazards drive adaptation and provide recommendations for the climate change finance community to support subsistence farmer adaptation. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 227 households in rural Ghana and Botswana were surveyed and their answers statistically analysed. Findings - The respondents' perception of climate-related hazards is analogous to existing environmental degradation. In the complex environment in which farmers operate, high vulnerability and climate dependency do not necessarily result in autonomous adaptation. Experience, means and perceived successfulness are more important factors, but these hardly relate to individual adaptive measures. Practical implications - Recommendations for adaptation finance institutions: build on existing development plans and policies on climate-related environmental problems; adaptation is more than a collection of adaptive measures, so financing adaptation is more than financing adaptive measures; extremely vulnerable people do not necessarily adapt autonomously, indicating that ex post adaptation remains important too. Originality/value - This study shows that highly vulnerable subsistence farmers do not automatically adapt and that adaptation is more than implementing adaptive measures. The outcomes are linked to the adaptation finance institutions.",0.6845651941157361,0.36298010879836834,0.0967420756818687,0.3799401487184567,0.10530422086924457,0.0966013728222462,0.1065665752950319
Rural household vulnerability to climate risk in Uganda,"Vulnerability assessment is fundamental for informing adaptation to climate change policy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the vulnerability of rural subsistence farmers in Uganda to climate risk. A mixed methods approach used semi-structured and guided interviews, and participatory techniques to explore perception, livelihood response and socio-economic status. Perception of climate risk varied, with wealthier farmers perceiving drought as highest risk, whilst poorer farmers perceived extreme heavy rainfall. Farmers implemented many general livelihood coping and anticipatory responses (54.7 %) to perceived impacts from drought, rainfall variability and extreme heavy rainfall. Examples included food storage, livestock maintenance and planting drought-resistant varieties. Other responses (45.3 %) were specific to individual climatic events, and farmers had no response to cope with rainfall variability. Climate risk was not the only driver of vulnerability. Soil infertility, pests and diseases, and economic instability also sustained decreasing trends in income. Adaptive capacity of households differed with external and internal attributes of sensitivity. Farmers with more land, education, access to governmental extension, a non-farm livelihood, larger households and older age had more capacity to buffer shock through increased assets and entitlements than poorer farmers who were more likely to engage in opportunistic behaviour like casual labouring. Few livelihood responses associated with perceived threat from the climate indicating response to a broader range of stressors. Conclusions determined inequality in livelihood response as a fundamental driver in households' ability to cope and adapt to climate risk.",0.9808452226733493,0.24790758885075467,0.05302444105772039,0.7387491245181995,0.02363136882161835,0.010691716711378923,0.06104183215351441
Crops and livestock under the sun: Obstacles to rural livelihood adaptations to hotter 21st century temperatures in eastern Senegal,"This article evaluates the proposition that farmers in dryland West Africa will be compelled by midcentury to shift household resources from crop to livestock production due to changing climate conditions. The article investigates the prospects for such a livelihood transition in the semiarid part of eastern Senegal, where downscaled statistical models indicate temperature increases of at least 2 degrees, that will have substantially negative impacts on crop yields. Based on survey of 448 households and focus groups conducted across an eco-climatological transect, the article presents evidence that this livelihood transition is already underway in many households but is increasingly out of reach for others. It uses statistical and qualitative analysis to argue that the most vulnerable householdscrop-dependent smallholders in the geographic area where the livelihood shift is most neededare the least prepared for it. The article shows that land degradation is both an additional cause of the transition and an obstacle to it. Soil exhaustion, made worse by the lack of opportunities to procure chemical fertilizer, is compelling many to seek to increase their livestock holdings. This strategy is constrained by rangeland degradation, which, made worse by expanding agriculture, reduces the viability of the transition for all but the wealthiest households. Households rely on migration to compensate for shortfalls in production, but this option is becoming closed off to those households who do not already have a member abroad. This is shown to raise the vulnerability of households who rely on a degraded resource base for their livelihoods.",0.7809992970155397,0.284331245298256,0.06803981513929214,0.6344154337371883,0.06588486660643054,0.03761105033038946,0.052029636527581746
Adaptation opportunities and maladaptive outcomes in climate vulnerability hotspots of northern Ghana,"How climate change adaptation practices can constrain development and deliver maladaptive outcomes in vulnerability hotspots is yet to be explored in-depth using case study analyses. This paper explores the effects of climate change coping and adaptation responses in three case study villages across the Central Gonja district of northern Ghana. The study addresses the following research questions: i) What are the key climatic and non-climatic stressors confronting households in northern Ghanaian communities? ii) How are households adapting to climatic and non-climatic stressors? and iii) What are the outcomes of these coping and adaptation responses on development? The study employs a mixed-method approach including key informant interviews, focus group discussions and household questionnaire surveys. Data identified socioeconomic stressors including a lack of access to (and high cost of) farm inputs, labour shortages and population growth. Climatic stressors include erratic rainfall, high temperature, droughts and floods. Climatic and non-climatic stressors interact to affect agricultural practices and related livelihoods. The study identified various adaptation measures including extensification and intensification of agriculture, temporary migration, planting of drought resistant varieties, irrigation, and livelihood diversification. We show that many coping measures (e.g. livelihood diversifications activities such as selling of firewood and charcoal production) and adaptation responses (including intensification, extensification and irrigation) currently deliver maladaptive outcomes, resulting in lock-ins that could exacerbate future climate vulnerabilities. The paper contributes to the growing literature on adaptation and climate risk management by providing empirical evidence showing how coping and adaptations measures can deliver maladaptive outcomes in vulnerable communities.",0.7638107574896935,0.35892041683459097,0.11416966840187034,0.6475878597402901,0.05592796945615243,0.029826865148152755,0.07626778312518627
Adaptation to climate change impacts: coping strategies of an indigenous community in Ghana to declining water supply,"Climate change can have disruptive impacts on water and other natural resources. In view of this, there is the need to marshal efforts and utilize available knowledge from diverse sources to enable society adapt to challenges associated with climate change. While a number of scientifically based and tested strategies have been utilized, indigenous means of adapting to global warming and other climate change impacts are also available. This study unearthed coping strategies adopted by Dupong, an indigenous community in Ghana to limit adverse impacts of climate change-induced water shortages. Community members were able to identify simple indicators that signalled climate change and its impacts on their water supply conditions. In addition, they adopted key strategies such as rainwater harvesting, reliance on alternative sources of water and increased roles of males in household water collection that enabled them to minimize the adverse impacts of climate change on their water supply situation. This paper argues that while these indigenous adaptation strategies are not perfect, they are affordable hence key adaptive measures such as rainwater harvesting could be improved upon to enhance their usefulness as coping mechanisms against climate change-induced declining water supply.",0.6367147420174186,0.27608448737506036,0.16921360360163515,0.4259733672058332,0.052647496504614186,0.0816594856867901,0.6976406676966637
Determinants of farmers' adaptation to climate change: A micro level analysis in Ghana,"This study analyzed socio-economic factors that influence farmers' adaptation to climate change in agriculture. Perceptions regarding long-term changes in climate variables and the rate of occurrence of weather extremes were also investigated. Additionally, farmers' perceived barriers to the use of adaptation practices were identified and ranked. A total of 100 farm-households were randomly selected from four communities in the Lawra district of Ghana and data were collected through semi-structured questionnaires, focused group discussions and field observations. A logistic regression model and weighted average index were used to analyze the data. The results showed that 87 % of respondents perceived a decrease in rainfall amount, while 82 % perceived an increase in temperature over the past 10 years. Results of the weighted average index indicate that dry spell and drought have a higher annual rate of occurrence than flood. Empirical results of the logistic regression model showed that education, household size, annual household income, access to information, credit and membership of farmer-based organization are the most important factors that influence farmers' adaptation to climate change. The main constraints on adaptation include unpredictability of weather, high farm input cost, lack of access to timely weather information and water resources. The policy implication of this study is that governments should mainstream barriers to, and choice factors of, adaptation practices to climate change related projects and programs.",0.9659448421256442,0.17499476684809107,0.09260096852442885,0.5752199018141204,0.01930513041756489,0.015919068282654134,0.057484764907618786
Adaptation to climate change or non-climatic stressors in semi-arid regions? Evidence of gender differentiation in three agrarian districts of Ghana,"With the increasing impacts of climate change in Africa, a relationship between rainfall and yields in semi-arid Ghana has been observed. Drawing insights from three agrarian societies in the semi-arid region of Ghana using qualitative research methods, the study reports how people currently deal with climate variability as insight on how they will deal with climate change in the future. The findings indicate wide gender inequality in decision making processes and land access resulting from patriarchal local customs and institutions that shape adaptation responses of different vulnerable social groups to climatic or non-climatic stressors. Different adaptation practices of groups indicate that both climatic and non-climatic stressors shape the kind of responses that groups adopt. From the current adaptation practices, efforts to improve adaptation to future climate change at local levels must give attention to the nexus of both climatic and non-climatic stressors, gender, differential vulnerabilities and other subjectivities that produce a particular adaptation practice in a given place.

The development of Ethiopia's Climate Resilient Green Economy 2011-2014: implications for rural adaptation,"Anthropogenic climate change is predicted to have severe impacts on national economies and individual livelihoods, particularly for the world's poorest populations. Measures to address climate change include both mitigation to reduce emissions and adaptation to climate change impacts. Prior to the Paris Conference of Parties 21 in 2015, few low-income countries had made extensive progress on either mitigation or adaptation. Ethiopia's Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) policy, introduced in 2011, stands out as an unusual example in its scope to reduce future emissions while also promoting adaptation through economic development. The formation of Ethiopia's CRGE between 2011 and 2014 demonstrates how a low-income country can rapidly develop a comprehensive policy for climate change using green growth. A case from the Rift Valley, however, illuminates the challenges facing government efforts to have its climate policy reach its predominantly rural population. Using multiple methods of key informant interviews, analysis of policy documents, and survey data collected during three years of study, 2012-2014, the data suggest a confluence of factors contributed to the design and emergence of Ethiopia's climate policy, notably Ethiopia's institutional autonomy and capacity. Despite being at the global forefront of climate policy for low-income countries, the reach of the Ethiopian state to implement programmes in the rural sector remains limited. Ultimately, Ethiopia is a bellwether for the combined mitigation and adaptation policy responses needed in many low-income countries to promote sustainable development in the face of climate change.",0.4297595828989603,0.34249704307768575,0.11569022331716446,0.38837781742654176,0.07193454195147342,0.14023185415708186,0.056224627430047344
Diversification Strategies and Adaptation Deficit: Evidence from Rural Communities in Niger,"The paper provides fresh empirical evidence on the adaptation process in Niger rural communities using original longitudinal socio-economic panel data merged with granular geo-referenced climatic information. We identify the main drivers and impacts of crop and labor diversification which constitute two livelihood strategies on moderating the adaptation deficit. In doing so, we account for the interdependence between the two diversification practices and potential reverse causality between welfare outcomes and diversification behavior. Moreover, we condition the impacts of diversification on different sections of the welfare distribution to capture potential non-linear effects. Our results reveal that the diversification has positive and significant welfare impacts when most vulnerable households rely on it as an adaptation strategy to mid-run climate variability and as a, coping strategy to short-run market shocks. At the same time, our results find lower but still positive impacts for well-endowed households that are likely to diversify their activity portfolio. Given the very limited presence of policy support, we conclude that the rural Nigerien communities are characterized by a large and autonomous adaptation response which constitutes a key leverage mechanism for policy makers. We thus suggest government interventions aimed at supporting the most important diversification drivers, but also aimed at straightening some channels, such as network infrastructures or the promotion of local crop varieties, which may have a greater potential in triggering diversification.

Drivers and responses to climate variability by agro-pastoralists in Kenya: the case of Laikipia County,"This paper examines factors influencing the choice of response strategies and the actual strategies smallholder farmers use to respond to the effects of climate variability in transitional climatic zones of Africa, specifically Laikipia West Sub-County in Kenya. Data for this study were collected from 392 randomly selected smallholder farmers, using a structured questionnaire. The study used principal component analysis to group together related strategies that farmers used to respond to the effects of climate variability, which resulted into seven groups of responses. Majority of farmers at 97.5%, 85% and 74.1%, respectively, used cultural practices, diversification practices and risk reduction practices. Intensification practices followed by 69.3% while terraces crop and herd management and new breeds were the least adopted at 27%, 13.2% and 9%, respectively. Multivariate probit model was then used to examine the factors influencing smallholder farmers' choice of response strategies to effects of climate change. The results indicated that access to weather information had a strong effect on use of risk management strategies at 74% and intensification strategies at 49%. Increase in level of education and exclusive dependence on agriculture increased the probability of introducing new breeds by 30% and 53%, respectively, while access to extension services increased use of terraces by 42%. Strong local institutions that facilitate access to information and credit are likely to initiate changes in key household characteristics, which positively affect response to effects of climate variability.

Rural transport and climate change in South Africa: Converting constraints into rural transport adaptation opportunities,"This study explored the implications of climate change for rural transport in South Africa. The article was seeking to convert existing rural transport adaptation constraints into rural transport adaptation opportunities. Challenges and constraints to rural transport adaptation transitions were also explored. The research methodology adopted was a review of the literature and references to case study examples. Then a four-stage multi-analytical approach was used to unravel and decode the major rural transport and climate change issues in South Africa. Consequent to the analysis, a framework of analysis for strongly integrating climate change to rural transport interventions was advanced. The findings indicated the existing rural transport adaptation measures and options in South Africa. The article concludes by highlighting the complexity and intricate dynamic nature of interactions, networks and systems that impact rural South Africa. Recommendations revolve around properly situating rural transport and climate change within the wider rural development challenges and matters facing contemporary South Africa.",0.5148449735780969,0.34724370351365647,0.11184155572375637,0.43203715915502205,0.06170573339127512,0.07718301136036829,0.07153349083247572
Small Scale Rain- and Floodwater Harvesting for Horticulture in Central-Northern Namibia for Livelihood Improvement and as an Adaptation Strategy to Climate Change,"This paper presents research results of the German-Namibian joint research project CuveWaters in which different technologies for small-scale rain- and floodwater harvesting were introduced as pilot plants in central-northern Namibia as part of a broader Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) approach. Central-northern Namibia has semi-arid climate conditions with clearly distinctive dry and wet seasons. Rain-and floodwater harvesting for irrigation purposes are intended to increase resilience in agricultural production by building buffers for interseasonal dry spells and to make irrigation farming possible during the dry season. This is intended to improve availability of vegetables in rural parts of Namibia and to derive income on local markets. Besides raising temperatures, climate change in sub-Saharan Africa is predicted to increase rainfall variability. Therefore, these adaptations also present a precondition for adapting to future climate change. Within the project, different organisational approaches such as harvesting of rainwater at the household as well as at the communal level were tested, as well as different locally available tank construction materials. All technologies were developed in cooperation with the local communities and framed by capacity development measures which yielded very good results and enabled a diffusion of the technology in the region. Based on 5 years of research the construction of ferrocement tanks on the household level and ponds covered with shade nets on the communal level can be recommended. Due to high evaporation rates all gardens irrigated with harvested rainwater were equipped with water saving drip irrigation systems. In combination with capacity development focusing on water management this enabled the users to irrigate their gardens throughout the dry season.",0.7619220852440508,0.23337854120398824,0.1182443116603486,0.4011969669261835,0.027735083433545207,0.07627197408594043,0.3371193499586403
Time matters: shifting seasonal migration in Northern Ghana in response to rainfall variability and food insecurity,"This article examines the interrelationships between rainfall variability, livelihood/food security and migration in rural Savannah communities in Northern Ghana. It addresses the question of how strong dry season migration is pronounced and whether the recent dominant migration type is a coping or adaptation mechanism. The analysis is based on empirical research conducted in four communities of the Nadowli District (Upper West Region), using a mixed methods approach. It was found that the households are highly dependent on rain-fed subsistence agriculture and livestock rearing, showing a low degree of economic diversification. Study participants in general complained about the unpredictability of the weather and linked changes in rainfall to declining crop yields and livestock possession as well as to increasing food prices. A common livelihood strategy used by households is dry-season migration to more suitable farming areas and to mining sites. Research in 2011 revealed that the majority of migrants were forced to migrate during the rainy season in order to feed the household members. This observation may indicate a shift in seasonal migration patterns with potentially harmful consequences for household livelihood security in the future.",0.8035026792189359,0.35802058307684065,0.08768103168540767,0.7499975412285205,0.047314420963173995,0.012775200007962215,0.03231897964670986
Understanding disaster resilience in communities affected by recurrent drought in Lesotho and Swaziland-A qualitative study,"Background Lesotho and Swaziland experience intense, recurring drought resulting in disaster situations. Despite the recurrence of drought, both its influence on rural subsistence communities' support systems and the actions that enable structures of resilience remain poorly understood. Each incidence of drought stimulates a disaster resilience discussion that stalls without achievement of positive results until the next disaster. This study has examined the influence of recurring drought on communities' inherent resilience and proposes an evidence-based framework to enhance community resilience. Methods Data were collected from 16 focus group discussions (N = 197) in the Highveld, Midveld and Lowveld agro-ecological regions of Swaziland and Lesotho. Themes and subthemes have been identified, defined, categorised and narrated using structuration theory as a guide. Results Resilience activities were found to be characterised by knowledgeability and changes in behaviour in adapting and applying appropriate actions, all of which were enhanced by institutional support. The effectiveness of institutional support hinged on harnessing communities' knowledge, social groups, value systems, connectedness, participation, decision-making and collectivism. Conclusion Large-scale interventions to build and strengthen resilience are urgently needed in order to maintain cohesiveness and development gains, especially because rural subsistence farmers make up the majority of these two countries' populations. Policies that integrate resilience with national development planning must be urgently developed and executed.",0.581581227236362,0.38538759014217205,0.10989246568131449,0.41307706572461994,0.05995737107062731,0.056842139053831196,0.31511875301651454
Useful traditional knowledge indicators for drought forecasting in the Mzingwane Catchment area of Zimbabwe,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify, analyse and document local traditional indicators used in drought forecasting in the Mzingwane Catchment and to assess the possibility of integrating traditional rainfall forecasting, using the local traditional indicators, with meteorological forecasting methods. Design/methodology/approach - Self-administered structured questionnaires were conducted on 101 respondents in four districts of the Mzingwane Catchment area, namely, Beitbridge, Mangwe, Esighodini and Mwenezi from February to August 2012. In addition, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were also used in data collection and the collected data were analysed for drought history and demographics; drought adaptation and the use of drought forecasting methods in the catchment using Statistical Package for Social Science. Findings - The paper reveals the growing importance of precipitation forecasts among Mzingwane communities, particularly the amount, timing, duration and distribution of rainfall. Rainfall was cited as the major cause of drought by 98 per cent of the respondents in the catchment. Whilst meteorological rainfall forecasts are available through various channels, they are not readily accessible to rural communities. Furthermore, they are not very reliable at local level. The paper shows that communities in the Mzingwane Catchment still regard local traditional knowledge forecasting as their primary source of weather forecasts. The paper finds that plant phenology is widely used by the local communities in the four districts for drought forecasting. Early and significant flowering of Mopane trees (Colophospermum mopane) from September to December has been identified to be one of the signals of poor rainfall season in respect to quantity and distribution and subsequent drought. Late and less significant flowering of Umtopi trees (Boscia albitrunca) from September to December also signals a poor rainfall season. Originality/value - The paper fulfils an identified need to study and document useful traditional drought indicators. Furthermore, the paper provides a platform for possible integration of traditional drought forecasting and meteorological forecasting and ensure sustainable rural livelihood development. The paper is useful to both meteorological researchers and resource-constrained communities in Mzingwane Catchment.",0.8416687399355942,0.3196069822034644,0.07259247326836792,0.5,0.04873768994758153,0.07860504212170356,0.18227866487894104

Enhancing adaptation to climate variability in the East African highlands: a case for fostering collective action among smallholder farmers in Kenya and Uganda,"There is an increasing recognition of the role of climate change adaptation among smallholder farmers in rain-fed agriculture in Africa. Collective action among smallholder farmers has been suggested as influencing local adaptation processes hence the need to evaluate its impact in different contexts. This paper provides evidence of collective action in enhancing local adaptation to climate variability. It determines the importance of different forms of collective action for enhancing adaptation. Through simple random sampling, a survey of 240 households in Embu County in Kenya and 200 households from Kapchorwa district of Uganda was undertaken. Focus-group discussions involving farmer groups and local government representatives were performed to triangulate information collected through the surveys. The results show a positive relationship between membership in farmer groups and adaptation to climate variability in both sites. Four main components of collective action were identified in Embu and these included the development of internal group capacities, assets mobilization and management, collective marketing, and management of human and natural capital. In Kapchorwa, the development of internal group capacities, risk spreading, and financial resources were significant. We argue that local-level governance and institutional arrangements for collective action are critical for successful adaptation to climate variability.",0.7719563793160891,0.26605111620145266,0.0739224707082406,0.4709137633406438,0.061034064587820874,0.05936762266106515,0.11160992797651302

"Institutional sustainability in the face of climate change: Empirical insights from irrigation institutions in the iringa rural district, Tanzania","Adaptation and mitigation have been proposed as strategies for addressing climate change, which is a predominant challenge facing society today. It has been found that an increase of 1 °C leads to a 5 % reduction in grain yield. From 1901 to 2010, the average sea level rose by 19 cm, and global emission of CO2 has increased by about 50 % since 1990. However, little attention has been paid to the link between institutional sustainability and climate change adaptation and mitigation. This paper argues that effective adaptation to and mitigation of climate change depends on the sustainability of both formal and informal institutions. Institutional sustainability is used in this paper to mean the ability of institutions, under particular conditions, to continue guiding actors to achieve desirable goals. Sustainable formal and informal institutions provide a framework that guide interactions among actors, including organizations and individuals, for mitigating and adapting to climatic change. Literature has pointed out a number of conditions that ensure institutional sustainability during climate change. Drawing from empirical insights from a case study in Tanzania, it is demonstrated that institutional sustainability is possible in the face of climate change and can be achieved through evolution and change, legitimacy, bricolage and performance and embracing practices of polycentric governance. Furthermore, a multiple institutional logics of action (MILA) theoretical framework was recommended for assessing institutional sustainability in the face of climate change. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",0.32967569677308867,0.33960732005332006,0.13810379720102428,0.3696334984359093,0.10515752150797755,0.12342934099641759,0.08900655142404677
Evidence and perceptions of rainfall change in Malawi: Do maize cultivar choices enhance climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan Africa?,"Getting farmers to adopt new cultivars with greater tolerance for coping with climatic extremes and variability is considered as one way of adapting agricultural production to climate change. However, for successful adaptation to occur, an accurate recognition and understanding of the climate signal by key stakeholders (farmers, seed suppliers and agricultural extension services) is an essential precursor. This paper presents evidence based on fieldwork with smallholder maize producers and national seed network stakeholders in Malawi from 2010 to 2011, assessing understandings of rainfall changes and decision-making about maize cultivar choices. Our findings show that preferences for short-season maize cultivars are increasing based on perceptions that season lengths are growing shorter due to climate change and the assumption that growing shorter-season crops represents a good strategy for adapting to drought. However, meteorological records for the two study areas present no evidence for shortening seasons (or any significant change to rainfall characteristics), suggesting that short-season cultivars may not be the most suitable adaptation option for these areas. This demonstrates the dangers of oversimplified climate information in guiding changes in farmer decision-making about cultivar choice.",0.9115384634890338,0.17441620470638522,0.07057097385244607,0.3569696097960564,0.042495188114608576,0.031359615197176297,0.0238218612416245
Exploring the link between climate change perceptions and adaptation strategies among smallholder farmers in Chimanimani district of Zimbabwe,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to establish the association between smallholder farmer perceptions toward climate change and adaptation strategies at the household level in Chimanimani District of Zimbabwe. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 284 households mainly using a structured questionnaire. The Heckman probit selection model was used to first identify the underlying socio-economic factors that affect households' recognition of climate change in the past 10 years, and the second model the factors that influence adaptation to the climate change phenomenon. Findings The majority of farmers (85 percent) perceived that climate change, characterized by rising temperatures and variability in rainfall patterns, has been occurring in the past ten years. As a response, farmers adapted using methods such as manuring and staggering of planting dates. Indigenous knowledge systems and non-governmental organizations increased the likelihood farmers' recognition of climate change (p<0.05). The probability of adopting multiple adaptation strategies was influenced by household head's education level, land tenure and access to public extension services. Originality/value This study showed that there is a link between farmers' prior knowledge of climate change and the number of adaptive investments. The analysis proposed an educational and extension approach that is embedded in the socio-cultural and traditional setting of farmers.",0.9528943529441766,0.2312474962001557,0.07519722764670145,0.5959407119672545,0.03132003088710525,0.021134176111116666,0.04324783947156029
Integrating Farmers and Scientific Methods for Evaluating Climate Change Adaptation Options in Embu County,"Potential for promoting sorghum crop as a climate change adaptation strategy for rain-fed agriculture in Embu County, Kenya was evaluated using farmer perceptions and scientific methods. Three hundred and sixty six smallholder farmers participated in the evaluation. The treatments which were overall rated as 'good' are tied ridges with a mean score of 2.9 and mean rank (2,873.87). Under this treatment sorghum grain yield of 3.7 t ha(-1) was recorded with application of 40 kg P ha(-1) + 20 kg N ha(-1) + Manure 2.5 t ha(-1). This was closely followed by tied ridges and contour furrows overall rated 'good' best three under the same soil fertility management options with a mean score ranging from 2.65 to 2.8 and yielding 2.7-3.7 t ha(-1). However, the treatments which were rated as 'poor' were experiment controls with a mean score below (1.43), mean rank (1,101.24) and yielding as low as (0.7 t ha(-1)). Therefore, integration of organic and inorganic inputs under various water harvesting technologies could be considered as an alternative option towards food security under climate change for semi-arid areas of Embu County.",0.8714205593220651,0.20826651297528728,0.12289839111461079,0.39988427868797055,0.02899847476609824,0.046080130325344235,0.02812988460987375
The interplay between planned and autonomous adaptation in response to climate change: Insights from rural Ethiopia,"Using the notion of institutional interplay, which refers to situations where the operation or consequences of one regime influence another regime, the article explores the interplay between planned adaptation and farmer households' autonomous adaptation. Drawing empirical data from two drought-prone districts in Northeastern Ethiopia (Kobo and Raya Azebo), this article deals with the differentiated effects of planned adaptation, exemplified by Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP). Two layers of differentiating effects are studied by looking at the differences between households that are and households that are not targeted by PSNP; and the more detailed differences are explored by zooming in on male and female-headed households, respectively, within the subset of households targeted by PSNP. We use semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with female and male household heads and key informant interviews with government officials. Our study indicates that the interplay has a differentiated effect following the participation of households in planned adaptation programs and gender lines. We show that the effect on building community assets can be positive at the community level and expands autonomous adaptation particularly for non-targeted households; however, targeted households in general and female-headed households in particular experience a negative effect of the interplay: planned adaptation constrains autonomous adaptation due to time and labor demands of public work, program restrictions and local gender norms.

Intra-seasonal risk of agriculturally-relevant weather extremes in West African Sudan Savanna,"Using household survey data and historical daily climate data for 29 communities across Upper East Ghana and Southwest Burkina Faso, we document climatic conditions deemed major threat to farming in the West African Sudan Savanna and assess risks posed by such conditions over the period 1997-2014. Based on farmers' perception, it is found that drought, low rainfall, intense precipitation, flooding, erratic rainfall pattern, extremely high temperatures, delayed rains, and early cessation of rains are the major threats farmers face. Using first-order Markov chain model and relevant indices for monitoring weather extremes, it is discovered that climatic risk is a general inherent attribute of the rainy season in the study area. Due to recent changes in onset of rains and length of the rainy season, some farmers have either resorted to early planting of drought-hardy crops, late planting of drought-sensitive crops, or spreading of planting across the first 3 months of the season to moderate harm. Each of these planting decisions however has some risk implications. The months of May, June, and October are found to be more susceptible to relatively longer duration of dry and hot spells, while July, August, and September are found to be more susceptible to intense precipitation and flooding. To moderate harm from anticipated weather extremes, farmers need to adjust their cropping calendar, adopt appropriate crop varieties, and implement soil and water management practices. For policy makers and other stakeholders, we recommend the supply of timely and accurate weather forecasts to guide farmers in their seasonal cropping decisions and investment in/installation of low cost irrigation facilities to enhance the practice of supplemental irrigation.",0.9277891386104157,0.22987899100798623,0.08409709870528799,0.4401896774093895,0.027165696403802196,0.021777864974738995,0.09577594853646357
"Factors influencing farmers' choices of adaptation to climate change in Ekiti State, Nigeria","Climate change poses a great threat to human security through erratic rainfall patterns and decreasing crop yields, contributing to increased hunger. The perceptions of the indigenous people about climate change and their responses to climate change have significant roles to play in addressing climate change. Therefore a critical study on farmers' choices of adaptation is critical for ensuring food security and poverty alleviation. A multi-stage random sampling technique was used to select 156 households in Ekiti state while descriptive statistics and multinomial logit (MNL) were used to analyze the data obtained from the households. The results showed that the most widely used adaptation method by the farmers were soil and water conservation technique measures (67 percent). The multinomial logit analysis revealed that the factors explaining farmer's choices of climate change adaptation include age of the farmers, gender of the household head, years of education, years of farming experience, household size, farmers information on climate change, farmers access to credit, farm income, non-farm income, livestock ownership and extension contact.",0.9838471457875592,0.17084939478871225,0.0626850459403871,0.6676322066289078,0.022878673341583992,0.009805486952436685,0.02885687679002278

Organic cotton production as an adaptation option in north-west Benin,"Organic agriculture is increasingly recognized as an adaptation measure to support sustainable livelihoods under a changing climate. This study assesses how it constitutes a suitable adaptation strategy in north-west Benin to make rural households more resilient to the increased likelihood of flooding, high-intensity rainfall or droughts. Based on household interviews, focus group discussions and expert interviews in villages around the Pendjari National Park, it was found that agricultural practices of organic cotton production directly reduced the most frequent climatic risks that households faced, and indirectly contributed to reducing economic risks and to empowering women. But there are also obstacles, such as the availability of sufficient organic material and the need for transport to dispersed fields, which currently limit adaptation potential.",0.8158962945585688,0.2713859982457709,0.10195873531848922,0.5091120639776975,0.04791844746653463,0.04562588604532207,0.09147628707991826
Perceived effects of drought on household food security in South-western Uganda: Coping responses and determinants,"Food insecurity is a region-wide problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, exacerbated by severe drought, with devastating impacts at the household level. However, farmers' coping strategies and their determinants remain under-documented. In this study, we: 1) characterise relationships between perceptions of drought and food insecurity and corresponding household coping responses, 2) compare livelihood characteristics of farmers that perceived food insecurity as a problem and those who did not, and 3) investigate how household-level characteristics correspond to household coping strategies. Our study is exploratory in nature: we administered a questionnaire to 140 farmers in Isingiro district in South-west (SW) Uganda whose livelihood is predominantly dependent on crop production. We employ binomial and multinomial logistic regression models to identify the determinants of the respondents' perceptions, how household characteristics correspond to household perceptions of food insecurity, and factors that affect coping responses. Our data show that 68.6% of the respondents perceived food insecurity as a problem in their household. Access to credit for crop cultivation increased the likelihood (p < 0.05) that farmers will be more aware and concerned about household food security status. Farmers were more likely to use the credit as a buffer against food insecurity. Whilst drought is widely perceived (by 95.6%: 133) as a problem contributing to food insecurity, the coping responses are wide-ranging. However a considerable 13% (of the total) reported to be "" doing nothing"" to respond to the drought effects. Notably, farmers that did not perceive food insecurity as a problem have higher (p = 0.01) off-farm incomes and larger (p = 0.00) farm sizes on average compared to those that did. Significant (p < 0.05) determinants of coping strategies include a combination of size of farmland, total income from crops, number of livestock and marital status. Broadly, our study indicates that households believe they are most at-risk of drought-induced food insecurity. Access to credit and alternative means of livelihood may offer resilience building options.",0.947024285587278,0.2264631903380315,0.061276475512573474,0.6886038414694517,0.02190252319233985,0.012423644360289175,0.05868874877672941
"Adapting to climate variability and change in rural Kenya: farmer perceptions, strategies and climate trends","Climate change has had a significant impact on rain-fed agricultural production in developing countries. Smallholder farmers are the most vulnerable, and currently must make production decisions in a high risk and uncertain environment with regard to rainfall and temperature. This paper uses climate and household survey data to analyse farmer perceptions regarding climate change, adaptation measures taken in response to these changes, and how well these perceptions correlate with meteorological data in Kenya. We find that a significant number of farmers perceive climate change as real, and that they are particularly concerned about changes in rainfall and temperature. Changing crop varieties is predominantly used as an adaptation measure since extension messages often encourage adoption of drought-resistant varieties. Major factors influencing farmer perceptions include age of the farmer, which is often associated with more farming experience and subsequent extension service. Except in low potential zones, farmers' perceptions of climatic variability are in line with climatic data records. Better education, access to extension messages, farm size and credit facilities are necessary for farmers to decide to adapt to climate change. The paper further assesses barriers to the adoption of various adaptation strategies, and lack of finances and knowledge have been found to inhibit adaptation response within the smallholder farming sector. Findings imply that effective adaptation to threats posed by climate variability and change requires a multi-dimensional collaborative approach, with different stakeholders playing key roles in providing support services in terms of education, extension, credit and meteorological information.",0.9822780784945547,0.17171695562718506,0.0473412816897728,0.6190321309778942,0.023340720122902066,0.01396649507348223,0.0391202214225266
"Adapting to the impacts of climate change in the sub-humid zone of Burkina Faso, West Africa: Perceptions of agro-pastoralists","This study examined the impact of climate change on pastoral livestock in Boulgou Province located in the sub-humid zone of Burkina Faso. We analysed the annual rainfall and temperature data from 1980 to 2012 using both Mann-Kendall's statistical test to show the long-term annual trends and Standardised Anomaly Index (SAI) to evaluate inter-annual rainfall fluctuations. We also conducted household interviews with 248 respondents to analyse agro-pastoralists' perceptions of climate change and variability, its impacts on livestock production and their acceptance of adaptation measures. A binary regression model was employed to identify the most important factors affecting agro-pastoralists' decisions to adopt specific adaptation measures. Within the period of study, the annual rainfall showed an upward trend, with high inter-annual variability and 818.9 mm of mean annual rainfall. Additionally, the annual minimum and maximum temperatures showed a statistically significant upward trend, with a rate of change of 0.20 degrees C and 0.27 degrees C per decade. The results of the household interviews indicated that most of the respondents (73.4 %) observed temperature changes compared with rainfall amount (1.2 %). To adapt to these changes, they have already adopted some adaptation measures that include the use of crop residue and herd destocking. Other less popular but innovative adaptation measures such as haymaking and use of concentrate livestock feeds could be promoted effectively under a comprehensive climate change adaptation action plan within a reviewed National Policy for Sustainable Livestock Development. This case study is one of the platforms through which poor agro-pastoralists' perception and recommendations can be accommodated in this proposed multi-stakeholder policy review.",0.8887739279366221,0.21858359657713455,0.10484792889511578,0.5,0.0383144464919942,0.052628736490376554,0.03994202451086854

Adoption of Climate Smart Agricultural Technologies and Practices in Drylands in Uganda: Evidence from a Microlevel Study in Nakasongola District,"Agriculture is the most important sector in Uganda’s economy, but it continues to experience challenges of erratic rainfall variability and environmental degradation. This paper is situated within post-structuralist geographical thought to (i) classify CSA practices and (ii) empirically quantify the relative importance of household socio-economic factors that structure the adoption of CSA practices in drylands in Uganda. The study was carried out in Nakasongola District in Central Uganda, and 143 geo-referenced questionnaires were used to collect relevant farming household and CSA data. Results indicated that timely planting, crop rotation, intercropping, and proper spacing were the most prevalent CSA practices, while rotational grazing, mulching, fertilizer use, and use of pesticides and herbicides were the least prevalent practices. Principal component analysis (PCA) generated a factor solution, and the components were clustered into three CSA practices: crop management, conservation agriculture, and land management practices. There are important differences in the propensity of households living in village settings to adapt. Parameter estimates indicated that the size of household, household income diversity index, access to pesticide uses, fertilizers, extension services, domestic water sources, improved seeds, credit, main decision-maker in the household, and education levels of the head of the household significantly influence (p &lt; 0.05) the adoption of CSA practices. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",0.9295159238536767,0.187574836010783,0.0950278690919956,0.6512563558144068,0.029505282028433565,0.019166559498698575,0.04324458519334209
What are the drivers of cocoa farmers' choice of climate change adaptation strategies in Ghana?,"This study analyses cocoa farmers' perception on climate change and adaptation strategies in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana. Better understanding of these perceptions would help identify knowledge gaps of cocoa farmers on climate change, and would help equip them with the requisite knowledge and skills on climate change and improve cocoa yields. The study is based on a cross-sectional survey of 240 cocoa farmers selected from six cocoa growing communities. Logit model is used to estimate factors influencing climate change adaptation strategies among cocoa farmers in the study area. The results of the study reveal that cocoa farmers perceive long-term changes in climatic variables which indicate their awareness of climate change and the impact on cocoa production. The adaptation strategies use by cocoa farmers in the study area includes planting of improved varieties of cocoa, increasing pesticide and fertilizer application, crop diversification, diversification to non-farm activities and planting of trees for shade. Gender, marital status, educational level, household size, engagement in other economic activities, farming experience, access to extension services, access to credit/loan, and cocoa income influence the cocoa farmers' choice of adaptation strategies. The study suggests that the government of Ghana should develop more effective climate change adaptation strategies as well as improve dissemination of information to farmers through extension agents in order to increase adoption of effective climate change adaptation strategies.",0.9855618842202373,0.18742933160702935,0.04094490119001049,0.647846938590426,0.03467376527706715,0.013213160586621673,0.039527915601695336
Whose knowledge matters in climate change adaptation? Perceived and measured rainfall trends during the last half century in south-western Tanzania,"Parts of eastern Africa have experienced substantial climatic variability and extremes during the last few decades. Here we explore the extent to which local place-based knowledge is used and is relevant to understanding and appropriately responding to place-based climate variability and change (specifically rainfall) in an area of considerable rainfall variability in south-western Tanzania. Primary data were collected using focus group discussions and household questionnaire surveys, and secondary data obtained from government institutions. Various changes associated with the frequency, intensity and consistency of rainfall during the period 1960 to 2014 are explored. Findings indicate that knowledge and perceptions associated with climate operate at a local level, and that these are not necessarily applicable to neighbouring regions. Smallholder farmers in the Great Ruaha River Sub-Basin rely on incremental adaptations of agricultural practices, in response to climatic stresses which have long-term implications. We argue that incremental adaptations ought to be supplemented by more transformative changes of existing agricultural practices, such as using more climate-adapted crops and livestock. Moreover, caution is required when examining human perceptions and responses to climate variability and change at the site-specific scale, as such findings may not necessarily be applicable to broader regions in all cases.",0.904899978775733,0.24502518320245958,0.08689724998856967,0.520465760265952,0.035865375186916834,0.02229345472740085,0.11047202642489995
"Will Adaptation Carry the Future? Questioning the Long-term Capacity of Smallholder Farmers' Adaptation Strategies against Climate Change in Gwanda District, Zimbabwe","Globally, smallholder farmers are adapting to the negative effects of climate change. This paper uses sustainability lenses to interrogate the capacity of current adaptation strategies used by smallholder farmers in Gwanda District, Zimbabwe. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were held with smallholder farmers, non-governmental organisation representatives, and Agriculture and Extension Services Department (AGRITEX) personnel to understand current adaptation methods used by smallholder farmers and the potential of those strategies to continue delivering positive results into the future. The study found out that most adaptation methods currently being promoted such as conservation agriculture and small grains have various implementation challenges which threaten their sustainability as long-term adaptation methods. Among other recommendations, this paper proposes that more research should be directed at understanding low-cost, labour friendly technologies and strategies for use with current adaptation methods in order to reduce the labour strain on ageing rural populations. © Kamla-Raj 2018.",0.9438326409764554,0.20720453616313425,0.08575167187738893,0.623989692867281,0.03946161437337998,0.024055377194707673,0.025457029168857077
Bespoke Adaptation in Rural Africa? An Asset-Based Approach from Southern Ethiopia,"Debates on adaptation in rural Africa rarely consider how responses to climate variability vary by wealth group. This study examines differences across wealth groups based on principal component analysis and cluster analysis triangulated with participatory methods. Results indicate that perceptions of weather variability and extreme events are detected by most households regardless of wealth status. The most common responses-using drought-resistant crops and changing planting dates-are also similar across groups. However, there are significant differences in the type of adaptation options adopted by wealthier and poorer farmers: the former intensify agriculture through improved seed varieties, fertiliser and manure; the latter depend on craft activities, seasonal migration and support from relatives and neighbours. Overall, our findings suggest that measuring asset holdings could allow a differentiated approach to supporting adaptation across socio-economic groups in rural regions in Ethiopia and Africa more broadly.",0.8451494202035691,0.25442885234424545,0.08798060585067295,0.5330288150295428,0.05747795351621684,0.03164035153171958,0.05586011242510675
Building an indigenous agro-pastoral adaptation framework to climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa: experiences from the North West Region of Cameroon,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), among other regions of the world, stands today as one of the hardest hit areas as far as the concomitants of climate change is concerned. This is particularly the case with the agro-pastoral sector which is the lifeblood of most of the economies of this region with about 85% of the indigenous populations relying on agriculture for their survival. Both long and short term climatic oscillations have succeeded to disrupt crop and livestock output thus signaling threats to food security. Although the communities have either consciously or unconsciously made use of some indigenous adaptation strategies, they are judged to be weak at the moment. This requires the designation of context-specific agro-pastoral adaptation frameworks. Using focus group discussions (FGDs) of 6 agro-pastoral groups (10 representatives each) in this region, complemented by field surveys and the extensive review of literature on case studies for other SSA communities, we analyze the knowledge, perceptions and adaptation strategies for individual agro-pastoral households in rural Cameroon. Our analysis of data leads us to conclude that future climatic situation is characterized by increasing unpredictability, introducing shocks of varying degrees in the crop and livestock sector necessitating varying formal and informal mechanisms. Current adaptation measures rely mainly on crop diversification and mixed farming. Although these methods are good, the scale of operation and the degree of diversification is still low to climate-proof the agro-pastoral sector. Furthermore, these changes are introduced in the midst of poor farming practices such as slash and burn and ankara systems. Current indigenous adaptation strategies are weak and have a connection with income levels, level of farmers organizations, knowledge and perception. (C) 2015 The Authors.

"Building pastoralists' resilience to shocks for sustainable disaster risk mitigation: Lessons from West Pokot County, Kenya","Most pastoralists' in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) are adversely affected by climate-change related shocks such as droughts and livestock diseases. These shocks lead to deterioration of livestock quality and even mass death of herds. This leaves pastoralists vulnerable as they derive most of their food and income needs from livestock, necessitating emergency disaster response and the need to build their long-term adaptive capacity. In most cases however, investments only focus on reducing risks and not on building long-term adaptation strategies. In this study, we analyzed factors affecting household resilience among the pastoralists of West Pokot County in Kenya. A focus group discussion and key informant consultations were held to understand community perspectives on the historical nature of climate-change related shocks. In additional, individual household surveys were done with 191 randomly selected households to obtain information on the shocks experienced by pastoralists, coping strategies, long term adaptation strategies and external support, their uptake of these and the effect on their resilience. The household resilience index was constructed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). An ordered probit regression was used to analyze the effect of socio-demographic, institutional factors and adaptive practices on households' resilience. It was noted that years of formal schooling, household income, access to credit and extension and adaptive practices such as post harvest use of field crops for grazing, enclosures, stocking improved breeds, bee keeping, ethno-veterinary practices and afforestation have a positive and significant effect in building household resilience to shocks. There is therefore a need to direct investment to bolster pastoralists' own efforts towards building their resilience.",0.7922126013226827,0.2964074896450337,0.08336454210179926,0.6722563563421416,0.018100502209462258,0.03442587113165163,0.051525256061984555
Farmer's response to climate change and variability in Ethiopia: A review,"Ethiopia is one of the most vulnerable countries experiencing drought and floods as a result of climate variability and change. Climate change in the form of higher temperature, reduced rainfall, and increased rainfall variability reduces crop yield and threatens food security in low income and agriculture-based economies. This study reviews impact of climate change and variability, and climate change adaptation strategies employed at farm level in response to perceived changes in temperature and precipitation. Climate change negatively affects agriculture, nutrition, ground water availability, soil organic matter and soil quality, health conditions, growth and poverty. The survey reveals that Ethiopian farmers adopt many strategies in response to climate change. These strategies include ""use of improved crop varieties,"" ""agroforestry practices,"" ""crop diversification,"" ""soil conservation practices,"" ""tree planting,"" ""off-farm activities,"" ""irrigation practices,"" ""adjusting planting dates,"" ""selling of assets,"" ""food aid,"" and ""permanent and temporary migration in search of employment"" are the most important adaptation strategies by smallholder farmers. However, ""level of education,"" ""gender,"" ""age,"" ""wealth of the head of household,"" ""access to extension and credit,"" ""information and climate social capital,"" ""agroecological settings,"" and ""temperature"" all influence farmer's choices; ""lack of information on adaptation methods,"" ""financial constraints,"" and ""lack of access to land"" as main barriers to adapt climate change and variability. Another investigator also revealed that farmers living in the dry lowland area perceived more change in climate than farmers in the wet lowland area.",0.9893060210967024,0.15563861106146518,0.0872248920152823,0.671664669638772,0.015592927107755337,0.008745462945523315,0.016960471742275034
"Forest adjacent households' voices on their perceptions and adaptation strategies to climate change in Kilombero District, Tanzania","Climate change is a global and local challenge to both sustainable livelihoods and economic development. Tanzania as other countries of the world has been affected. Several studies have been conducted on farmers' perceptions and adaptation to climate change in the country, but little attention has been devoted to forest adjacent households in humid areas. This study assessed this gap through assessing forest adjacent households' voices on perceptions and adaptation strategies to climate change in Kilombero District, Tanzania. Data collection involved key informant interviews, focus group discussions and household questionnaires. Results showed that the majority of households perceived changed climate in terms of temperature increase, unpredictable rainfall, frequent occurrence of floods, increased dry spells during rainy season coupled with decreased water sources and emergence of new pests and diseases. The perceived change in climate has impacted agriculture productivity as the main livelihood source. Different coping and adaptation strategies are employed. These are; crop diversification, changing cropping calendar, adopting modern farming technologies, and increasing reliance on non-timber forest products. These strategies were positively and significantly influenced by socio-economic factors including household size, residence period, land ownership and household income. The study concludes that, there are changes in climatic conditions; and to respond to these climatic changes, forest adjacent households have developed numerous coping and adaptation strategies, which were positively and significantly influenced by some socio-economic factors. The study calls for actual implementation of local climate change policies and strategies in order to enhance adaptive capacity at household level.",0.9342669968712188,0.2229821262293672,0.13656516997718618,0.6328086760366414,0.03336787945597164,0.01698061146410599,0.09322861515365823
The positive impacts of farm land fragmentation in Rwanda,"Land fragmentation and land consolidation are two interrelated concepts of land management. The dominant discourse is that fragmented land ownership and land use tend to be ineffective and unwanted, and land consolidation is then a solution to this quandary. Not surprisingly, in countries such as Rwanda, the majority of the governmental strategies highlight the negative effects of fragmentation. However, the effects of land fragmentation have been dual. Its positive side has often been overlooked by policy makers and the research community. Therefore, this study investigates to which degree one can benefit from farmland fragmentation, especially in the context of food security at the household level and of climate change vulnerability. The goal of this article is to expand the current land fragmentation discourse and describe in which context specific types of land fragmentation may be just as sustainable as opting for land consolidation. The guiding hypothesis hereby is that there is a high level of fragmented land ownership yet, that physical (location, use, internal, shape and value) fragmentation acts as a risk management strategy which positively impacts the nutritional balance for food quality and food sustainability as components of food security. Conceptually, land fragmentation can be seen from multiple lenses. It can be seen as a land use concept (emphasizing variation in manner of agricultural production, variety of crops, frequency of harvesting, etc.). It can also be seen as a geodetic concept (emphasizing variation in shape and size of parcels on the one hand, and variation in land ownership on the other hand). Additionally, it can be seen as a spatial planning and intervention concept (emphasizing the urgency and need for order, structure and alignment of space). In our article we look at fragmentation (and the variation thereof) in all three ways. If within an area, the utilization, ownership, leasehold, shape, size and location of parcels and spatial policies vary more than average (as compared to a similar area), then we consider it a fragmented landscape. Once we find a case of such a landscape, then we are able to investigate why and/or under which conditions (and by which drivers) this 'fragmented' landscape has emerged and what are the implications. This is the main question under investigation in this research. The research relies on a mixed methods research approach via household surveys with 98 random respondents in Gashora sector, Bugesera District, Eastern province of Rwanda. The data collection included further 7 key informants' interviews, a focus group discussion, field observations of current plot sizes and land uses, and the review of the existing literature on the topic. The findings indicate that a high level of fragmentation exists, both in terms of land ownership (visible and hidden) and physical landscape. The dominant reasons are that land users perceive this as an effective risks management strategy which would positively affect food quality, food sustainability and food security. Multiple land holdings with different shapes in different locations allow farmers to grow multiple crops with different adaptation capacities in different growing conditions (soil type, slope, microclimate variations, etc.). Furthermore, fragmentation seems to help reduce land ownership and use related conflicts despite its negative impacts on agriculture production efficiency, especially the loss of land through boundaries and the increase in boundaries related conflicts. Unlike previous studies on land fragmentation, we posit that environmental and agricultural policies should take both negative and positive impacts of land fragmentation into account equally as sustainable and resilient solutions, given the right circumstances and contexts, especially for vulnerable and food insecure areas in Rwanda.",0.7844505326942126,0.2853021844549383,0.11295345371462746,0.4745837083045913,0.053595931955624884,0.07624742453353488,0.04004279699372769
Pursuing productivity gains and risk reduction in a multi-hazard landscape: A case study from eastern Uganda,"Agricultural land and natural resource management has an important role to play in reducing the vulnerability of rural populations to hazard risk and to promote increases in agricultural yields. Though strategies for hazard risk mitigation and productivity gains are sometimes viewed in opposition to each other, many of the practices promoted to achieve one goal provide co-benefits toward the other. Our understanding remains imperfect with respect to the mechanisms underlying the use of such practices, and how these motivations are weighted in the context of multiple environmental hazards, multiple practice alternatives, and multiple sources of information. This study addresses these knowledge gaps by investigating the voluntary adoption of agricultural land management practices among farmers in the Bugisu sub-region in eastern Uganda. A set of multinomial logistic (MNL) regression analyses reveal that socio-economic and risk perception factors contribute significantly to the use of the more labor-intensive practices, while others are best explained by variations in household income and income streams. The village context is an important factor in explaining variation in use rates, and the contributions of village characteristics beyond the household are discussed, as is the role that risk reduction and agricultural development organizations play in facilitating adoption. The results of this study are well placed to inform the intervention targets of development and disaster risk reduction organizations seeking to increase uptake of agricultural land management practices.",0.8452348131222152,0.23839577295015368,0.10878511318816791,0.4237471345591651,0.039995822895957614,0.03604008003640546,0.06963545466701555
"Resource Use Efficiency as a Climate Smart Approach: Case of Smallholder Maize Farmers in Nyando, Kenya","To simultaneously enhance agricultural productivity and lower negative impacts on the environment, food systems need to be much more efficient in using resources such as land, water, and fertilizer. This study examines resource use efficiency of maize production among smallholder farmers in Nyando, Kenya. The main objective is to assess the degree of technical efficiency of smallholder farmers and identify the impact of so-called climate smart practices on technical efficiency. The method of Stochastic Frontier Analysis is used to simultaneously estimate a stochastic production frontier and a technical inefficiency effect model. Data for 324 subplots farmed by 170 households were available for this analysis. The study reveals that maize production in Nyando is associated with mean technical efficiency of 45% and that soil conservation practices such as residue management, legume intercropping, and improved varieties significantly increase farmers' technical efficiency. Soil carbon is found to be a critical factor of production. These results imply that there is potential to more than double production using the same resources and that soil conservation practices can be very climate smart, at once increasing soil carbon, production, climate resilience, and technical efficiency.",0.9560334828386983,0.18431508391588503,0.10263070646829127,0.45392451553763774,0.022699837272418595,0.019167935409501336,0.04005296181273015
"CLIMATE CHANGE PERCEPTION AND ADAPTATION IN NIGERIA'S GUINEA SAVANNA: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM FARMERS IN NASARAWA STATE, NIGERIA","Nigeria's guinea savanna produces the bulk of the food consumed in the country and climate change is adversely affecting agriculture in the area. Farmers in the area respond differently to climate change based on their perception. Yet, studies that systematically link farmers' perception on climate change to scientific data from meteorological stations are rare in Nigeria's guinea savanna Much rarer are studies that consider the simultaneity in the adaptation decisions of the farmers. This study therefore aimed at analysing farmers' perception in comparison with meteorological data and the determinants of adaptation efforts of crop farmers in the areas with data from Nasarawa State of Nigeria. To achieve this aim, the study combined time-series data on climatic variables obtained from a weather station and cross-sectional data from 160 smallholder farmers selected from the area. The study applied descriptive statistics, trend analysis, and multivariate probit model in analysing data collected. The study showed reduction in volume of rainfall and significant increase in surface temperature with the farmers having firm perception of these changes. The farmers responded to the changes in temperature and rainfall by choosing adaptation strategies such as use of improved crop varieties, soil and water conservation, tree planting, changing dates of sowing and tillage options, irrigation, diversifying their means of livelihood, and farmland management. Interestingly, these strategies were complementary and farmers' socioeconomic and institutional characteristics significantly determined adaptation in the area. Therefore, considering farmers' socioeconomic characteristics and improving the institutions will help in future and planned adaptation efforts of governments.",0.9925881311433097,0.13592896146446043,0.09268947255384868,0.5909995480618404,0.013077285692798698,0.008906904226447816,0.029097294294589748

"Climate trends, risks and coping strategies in smallholder farming systems in Uganda","Smallholder farmers in Uganda face a wide range of agricultural production risks. Climate change and variability present new risks and vulnerabilities. Climate related risks such as prolonged dry seasons are becoming more frequent and intense with negative impacts on agricultural livelihoods and food security. This paper examines farmers' perceptions of climate change, climate-related risks affecting crop and livestock production, including climate-risk management and adaptation strategies. Percieved changes in climate included erratic rainfall onset and cessation (which were either early or late), poor seasonal distribution of rainfall and decreased rainfall. In addition, farmers reported variations in temperatures. Drought, increasing disease and pest incidences, decreasing water sources, lack of pasture, bush fires, hailstorms, changes in crop flowering and fruiting times were the major climate-related risks reported. In order to cope with climate change and climate variability, farmers use a wide range of agricultural technologies and strategies. Mulching, intercropping and planting of food security crops were among the most commonly used practices. Other strategies included water harvesting (mainly for domestic consumption), other soil and water conservation technologies and on-farm diversification. Farmers often use a combination of these technologies and practices to enhance agricultural productivity. Analysis of trends in temperature and rainfall showed an increase in average maximum temperatures, while average annual rainfall showed mixed results, where a general decline was observed in one district and a relatively stable trend in the other district. Farmers' perception of changing rainfall characteristics and increasing temperatures were consistent with observed historical climatic trends based on meteorological data.",0.9969085494673247,0.09524891735930464,0.07168971590906513,0.6492576524218037,0.014748043581319462,0.00517100628757324,0.02492954564578659
Role of community based local institution for climate change adaptation in the Teesta riverine area of Bangladesh,"Climate change adaptation is one of the most crucial issues in developing countries like Bangladesh. The main objective was to understand the linkage of participation with Community Based Adaptation (CBA) to climate change. Institutional framework following different types of conceptual theories (collective action, group, game and social learning theory) was utilized to analyze the participatory process in local community level Village Disaster Mangement Committee (VDMC) that works in collaboration with local government. Field level data was collected through interview and group discussion during 25 April to 30 May 2015 in the Teesta riverine area of northern Bangladesh. Results showed that flood and drought were the major climate change impacts in the study area, and various participatory tools were used for risk assessment and undertaking action plans to overcome the climate change challenges by the group VDMC. Participation in VDMC generated both relational and technical outcomes. The relational outcomes are the informal institutional changes through which local community adopt technological adaptation measures. Although, limitations like bargaining problem, free riding or conflict were found in collective decision making, but the initiation of local governance like VDMC has brought various institutional change in the communities in terms of adaptation practices. More than 80% VDMC and around 40-55% non-VDMC household respondents agreed that overall community based adaptation process was successful in the previous year. They believed that some innovative practices had been brought in the community through VDMC action for climate change adaptation. No doubt that the CBA has achieved good progress to achieve the government Comprehensive Disaster Management (CDM) strategy of climate change adaptation. But, there is still lack of coordination among local government, NGOs and civil partners in working together. Research related to socio-economic impact analysis for the sustainability of adaptation measures implemented through local community could be undertaken in future. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Do Development Interventions Confer Adaptive Capacity? Insights from Rural India,"Risks due to the occurrence of climatic aberrations pose an impediment to the economic growth of the households in vulnerable regions. The frequency of these events is projected to increase in the foreseeable future, with developing countries being the worst sufferers. Dealing with this appears to be an additional burden on the resources of such countries, a large part of which is already devoted to providing better living standards for its inhabitants. Does this imply that developmental interventions should be discontinued? Is there a link between these programs and adaptation to environmental shocks? In an effort to answer such questions, the paper examines the impact of the developmental schemes on the livelihood of the households in Western Odisha, India and investigates whether they augment post disaster coping and adaptation as well. The results indicate that overall the programs have made an impact concerning their intended goals but the diffusion of benefits across beneficiary groups is heterogeneous. Additionally, the programs have contributed in post disaster coping, but only in the regions where either they performed well or their penetration was extensive. Activities promoting livelihood diversification, food security, and poverty reduction also tacitly facilitate improvements in the resilience of the individuals and communities thereby enhancing their capacity to deal with climatic risks. Policy implication advocates the continuation of developmental interventions. However, realigning their framework to incorporate actions intended toward disaster risk reduction and management would result in more inclusive impacts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Perceptions matter: household adaptive capacity and capability in two Australian coastal communities,"This paper presents empirical data on household perceptions of capability to adapt to climate hazards and associated capacity needs. Households play an important role in responding to the impact of a changing climate by creating a functional link between individual and community responses to change. However, household perspectives on their capacity needs are rarely sought in programs seeking to provide incentives for household action-despite the influence of normative values and perceptions on household action. Rather, interventions are often informed by quantitative measures of adaptive capacity, such as access to financial or social capital. An alternative approach involves analysis of social narratives of capability that reflect normative perceptions of climate risk and capacity needs. Implementation of this approach reveals that a significant number of households in vulnerable locations consider existing capacities sufficient to manage familiar climate hazards, regardless of socio-economic circumstance. Our comparative study of two Australian coastal communities also suggests that a dominant narrative of capability to manage climate hazards reduces the likelihood of household investments in adaptive actions. While socio-political influences on narratives are often deeply embedded and difficult to change in the short term, identifying perceived risk and response capacity is pivotal in determining the likely utility of adaptive capacity stocks as measured through quantitative means.",0.46268253358260875,0.3453213194842842,0.11428990323393591,0.3947564603749315,0.10657126151890031,0.11176624165345364,0.13964347362229956
Mitigating Climate Change Related Floods in Urban Poor Areas: Green Infrastructure Approach,"Natural disasters continue to hit urban areas worldwide, undermining community resilience capacity. The combination of increasing precipitation because of climate change, sea level rise, and uncontrolled rapid urbanization bring greater risk of flooding impacts in urban areas. Such flooding has a disproportionate effect on the urban poor, who often live in informal settlements. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of informal settlements encroaching on floodplains that restrict the storage of flood waters and the expansion of impermeable urban surfaces also contribute to the increasing magnitude and frequency of flooding. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge the urban poor as the most vulnerable community and also as key party in mitigation efforts. Although mitigation measures are currently in place to lessen the impact of climate change related floods in urban poor areas, little attention has been given to the use of green infrastructure as a mitigation strategy. Hence, this study aimed to examine current practices of green infrastructure (GI) in urban poor areas of Kibera (Kenya), Madurai (India) and Old Fadama (Ghana) to mitigate climate related flood impacts. Using the multiple case study method, it was investigated how urban stakeholders address and overcome the critical issues of governance, finance and awareness to secure the success of GI implementation. It was found that GI requires comprehensive understanding of political, social, economic and environmental aspects of the urban poor population to secure the success of initiatives, while cohesive cooperation and full participation of urban stakeholders is the key.",0.0727634321851605,0.43116376864580014,0.10932208244944114,0.27347331208009756,0.10089389615065533,0.8804505041711557,0.29064216989155267
"Responses to Climate Variability in Urban Poor Communities in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","South Africa's rising urbanization has exacerbated the levels of urban poverty and inequality. The urban poor are increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and have weak household risk response capacities. The study, through the use of a questionnaire survey, investigated how climate stressors such as the change of seasons, drought, heat waves, cold spells, hailstorms, floods, disease outbreaks, and veld fires are affecting four socioeconomically marginalized urban communities in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal. The respondents identified eight stressors that affect lifestyles and livelihoods; however, the majority do not have the means to cope adequately. Moreover, the coping strategies that were adopted were stop-gap reactive-type measures and provide limited capacity to build resilience and response capacity. With the projections that climate stressors will increase in frequency and duration in the region, the local government must increase investment in urban pro-poor climate change projects, which have been successful in some rural and urban areas, and educate the communities on climate-related risks so as to increase their knowledge and response capacities.",0.44340389432468824,0.366185811119202,0.07935319475717342,0.411593697168311,0.051227370996657765,0.237022580752392,0.1086391490230129

"On the predicted effectiveness of climate adaptation measures for residential buildings (Reprinted from vol 82, pg 300-316, 2014)","In a changing outdoor climate, new buildings as well as the existing building stock need to adapt in order to keep providing their inhabitants and users a comfortable and healthy indoor environment, with a minimum or - preferably - no increase in energy consumption. In this paper, the effectiveness of six passive climate change adaptation measures applied at the level of building components is assessed using building energy simulations for three generic residential buildings as commonly built in - among others - the Netherlands: (1) detached house; (2) terraced house; (3) apartment. The study involves both residential buildings that are built according to the regulations and common practice in 2012, and residential buildings that were constructed in the 1970s, with a lower thermal resistance of the opaque and transparent parts of the building envelope. The climate change adaptation measures investigated are: (i) increased thermal resistance; (ii) changed thermal capacity; (iii) increased short-wave reflectivity (albedo); (iv) vegetation roofs; (v) solar shading; and (vi) additional natural ventilation. This paper quantifies the effectiveness of these climate change adaptation measures for new residential buildings as well as for renovation of the current building stock. The performance indicator is the number of overheating hours during a year. It is shown that exterior solar shading and additional natural ventilation are most effective for this performance indicator. Furthermore, increasing thermal insulation to reduce energy use for heating demands additional measures to prevent overheating. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Strengthening climate change adaptation capacity in Africa-case studies from six major African cities and policy implications,"Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions in respect of climate change. As the African continent struggles to adapt to climate change, a variety of measures are being pursued to alleviate the resultant pressures on people, properties and their livelihoods in several African cities. Collectively, they show that climate change adaptation in Africa is not as hopeless as widely claimed, and that there are some promising prospects. The literature shows a deficiency on studies which examine the extent to which climate change adaptation is being pursued in African cities. This paper addresses this need, and outlines some of the most important climate threats (e.g. increasing temperatures, droughts, sea level rise, sea and river flooding) and synergic non-climate factors, as well as recent progress made In respect of implementing climate change adaptation in African cities. Rather than adopt a general description of trends, this research focuses on concrete case studies from six major cities across the central, western, and eastern regions of the African continent (Douala, Lagos City, Dar-es-Salaam, Accra, Addis Ababa and Mombasa). The vulnerability and adaptive capacity status of the studied cities are discussed. Difficulties and challenges encountered in implementing adaptation policies in these areas are also highlighted. Furthermore, some successful examples of climate change adaptation initiatives in the surveyed cities are provided. Finally, the paper outlines some of the policy measures which can be implemented towards strengthening the capacity of African cities to adapt to a changing climate.",0.31806625094866303,0.40565165951869275,0.09832652848282526,0.27942023269077093,0.07423357842714325,0.38528939357941683,0.14052918065909248

Reaching the end goal: Do interventions to improve climate information services lead to greater food security?,"Climate change is projected to have profound effects on nutritional outcomes, particularly among children under five in developing countries, where small-scale, subsistence farming and livestock production supports a majority of livelihoods. An underlying mechanism by which climate change will negatively affect nutrition is through increased food insecurity, as both crop and livestock production are threatened by changing patterns of rainfall and temperature. Climate information services (CIS) provide short and long-term weather and climate forecasts through a variety of means with the aim of increasing smallholder farmers' ability to cope and adapt to a changing environment. CIS can be used to increase climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, which in turn can increase agricultural productivity and farmer resilience, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Through household surveys, focus group activities, and participant observation, this research investigates linkages between CIS, uptake of CSA practices, and household food security through investigation of four research sites, two in Senegal and two in Kenya. The research sites were selected based on their various levels of engagement in CIS programs sponsored by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) at the time research was conducted. The role of gender dynamics in the relationship between CIS, CSA, and food security is also explored through 1) sex-disaggregated quantitative from household surveys, and 2) sex-disaggregated qualitative data focus groups, which focuses in part on conceptualization of women's empowerment. Findings indicate that farmers are receiving CIS and are using that information to make changes in farming practices, without major differences between men and women. This research suggests that CCAFS-CIS interventions may be leading to adoption of CSA practices; however, no direct correlation between receipt of CIS and use of CSA practices was found, nor was a relationship established between use of CSAs and food security. These findings are inconclusive, however, given the near complete coverage of CIS and widespread food insecurity across sites. Importantly, participants did not ascribe their knowledge of CSA practices to CIS, and the important role of social and informal networks as a source of climate information emerges as an important area of additional exploitation for increased uptake of CSA for improved food security.",0.9520971821007808,0.17834893409148841,0.08785189119760779,0.7400773593146902,0.024340729027292018,0.01178977510877043,0.015986875392133046
Subsidies promote use of drought tolerant maize varieties despite variable yield performance under smallholder environments in Malawi,"This study used a three-year panel dataset for 350 Malawian farm households to examine the potential for widespread adoption of drought tolerant (DT) maize varieties, a technology that holds considerable promise for helping smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) adapt to drought risk. Regression results revealed that DT maize cultivation increased substantially from 2006 to 2012, with the main driver being the Malawi Farm Input Subsidy Program. Recently experienced drought and farmer risk aversion stimulated adoption of DT maize. In yield performance, improved maize varieties performed significantly better than local maize during the 2011/12 drought year. However, DT maize did not perform significantly better than other improved maize varieties used in Malawi, which is in contradiction to results obtained from on-station and on-farm trials. A plausible explanation is that the severe drought in Malawi in the 2011/12 season occurred early in the rainy season and DT maize primarily provides an advantage in the case of late droughts during the silking/grain filling stage of the crop. Preliminary results herein suggest that it was lack of rainfall in December 2011 that constrained maize yield while rainfall in January and February was less limiting. Additionally, the length of the longest dry spells in December and February further strengthens the evidence in favor of this explanation, but further research is needed to reach a conclusion.",0.9636621906870857,0.18744837606876766,0.059374243112890426,0.4877245476012907,0.019059995001853406,0.021991833973073784,0.03971615964691319

Impact of Climate Change on Cultivar Choice: Adaptation Strategies of Farmers and Advisors in German Cereal Production,"The objective of this study is to understand which requirements for cereal cultivarswith regard to climate change adaptationare in demand by farmers and advisors, and to clarify whether there are any differences in their assessments. A comparative survey was used to collect data from 410 farmers and 114 advisors in Germany. The majority of both farmers and advisors reported perceivable effects of climatic change on plant production. The increase in droughts and hot spells, the increased incidence of torrential rain, and mild winters were mentioned as the main effects of climate change. For climate change adaptation, the farmers and advisors mostly relied on a locally-adapted cultivar selection. It is estimated that eco-stability, grain yield, resistance to lodging and drought tolerance are important cultivar properties. In the study, farmers and advisors equally pointed out the need for additional cultivar evaluation according to eco-stability. Finally, only minor differences regarding farmers' and advisors' assessments were found within the study. The outcome of this research points to the need of implementing farmers' demands in cultivar recommendations. For example, an impartial assessment of cultivars' eco-stability could help support the choice of cultivars and reduce the growing risks in cereal production with regard to climate change.",0.9290339069906186,0.19037936178754197,0.08271585918543282,0.4094491165556485,0.019371006332932022,0.03584837013536858,0.028489208115576876
Improved production systems for traditional food crops: the case of finger millet in western Kenya,"Increasing agricultural productivity through the dissemination of improved cropping practices remains one of the biggest challenges of this century. A considerable amount of literature is dedicated to the adoption of improved cropping practices among smallholder farmers in developing countries. While most studies focus on cash crops or main staple crops, traditional food grains like finger millet have received little attention in the past decades. Traditional food grains have however an important potential to improve food security, reduce micronutrient deficiencies, and enhance smallholder adaptation to climate change. The present study aims to assess the factors that influence adoption decisions among finger millet farmers in western Kenya. Based on cross-sectional household data from 270 farmers, we estimated a multivariate probit model to compare the adoption decisions in finger millet and maize production. While improved practices such as the use of a modern variety or chemical fertilizer are relatively well adopted in maize production, they are less common in finger millet production. Social networks as well as access to extension services play crucial roles in the adoption of improved finger millet practices, while the same variables are of minor importance for the adoption of improved maize practices. A Cobb-Douglas production function shows a positive effect of modern varieties and chemical fertilizer on finger millet yields.",0.978366525116438,0.1634494719462619,0.053398829426629775,0.585221514935614,0.01857863830940068,0.014358879097496445,0.02980518294522738
"Adaptation of agriculture to climate change in semi-arid Borena, Ethiopia","Livestock production is very risky due to climate variability in semi-arid Sub-Saharan Africa. Using data collected from 400 households in the Borena zone of the Oromia Region, we explored what drives adoption of agricultural practices that can decrease the vulnerability of agro-pastoralists to climate change. Households with more adaptive capacity adopted a larger number of practices. The households' adaptive capacity was stronger when the quality of local institutions was high. However, adaptive capacity had less explanatory power in explaining adoption of adaptation options than household socio-economic characteristics, suggesting that aggregating information into one indicator of adaptive capacity for site-specific studies may not help to explain the adoption behaviour of households. Strong local institutions lead to changes in key household-level characteristics (like membership to community groups, years lived in a village, access to credit, financial savings and crop income) which positively affect adoption of agricultural practices. In addition, better local institutions were also positively related to adoption of livestock-related adaptation practices. Poor access to a tarmac road was positively related to intensification and diversification of crop production, whereas it was negatively related to the intensification of livestock production, an important activity for generating cash in the region. Our findings suggest that better local institutions lead to changes in household characteristics, which positively affect adoption of adaptation practices, suggesting that policies should aim to strengthen local institutions.",0.9535084847345154,0.20619227354767944,0.08264276784125453,0.7396497196323745,0.03172015401201723,0.01167432444079884,0.045847250328584624
Measuring the impacts of adaptation strategies to drought stress: The case of drought tolerant maize varieties,"This study measured the impacts of drought tolerant maize varieties (DTMVs) on productivity, welfare, and risk exposure using household and plot-level data from rural Nigeria. The study employed an endogenous switching regression approach to control for both observed and unobserved sources of heterogeneity between adopters and non-adopters. Our results showed that adoption of DTMVs increased maize yields by 13.3% and reduced the level of variance by 53% and downside risk exposure by 81% among adopters. This suggests that adoption had a ""win-win"" outcome by increasing maize yields and reducing exposure to drought risk. The gains in productivity and risk reduction due to adoption led to a reduction of 12.9% in the incidence of poverty and of 83.8% in the probability of food scarcity among adopters. The paper concluded that adoption of DTMVs was not just a simple coping strategy against drought but also a productivity enhancing and welfare improving strategy. The results point to the need for policies and programs aimed at enhancing adoption as an adaptation strategy to drought stress in Nigeria and beyond. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Effects of climate variability and insurance adoption on crop production in select provinces of South Africa,"Increasing climate variability increases the risks in production and prices of agricultural products. Inarguably, Africa's susceptibility to climate change is high because it hosts the majority of the world's poor who cannot afford the costs of coping mechanisms. Agricultural insurance is being largely put forward as a coping measure of adapting to climate change to sustain farm production and farmers' livelihood. The study critically reviewed numerous publications on climate change impacts and the role of insurance in the adaptation process. It examined the effects of varying weather conditions and insurance on net crop revenue using the instrumental variable regression approach on a Ricardian model. The study further identified factors influencing the purchase of insurance among the farmers with a probit model. The study data were collected from a cross section of farmers in three selected provinces of South Africa. Results of data analysis indicated that owning insurance, number of labourers employed, size of irrigated farmland and rainfall have significant effects on net revenue. It was also revealed that experience, indicated by years of farming and revenue, influenced farmers' adoption of insurance. Consequently, the paper advocates for the provision of efficient irrigation facilities and promotion of insurance among farmers.",0.964583210243691,0.20017810806504166,0.06658866456067632,0.5371415083235584,0.021608744895736682,0.01917529445705794,0.041592805862000426
Facing famine: Somali experiences in the famine of 2011,"In 2011-12, Somalia experienced the worst famine of the twenty-first century. Since then, research on the famine has focused almost exclusively on the external response, the reasons for the delay in the international response, and the implications for international humanitarian action in the context of the ""global war on terror."" This paper focuses on the internal, Somali response to the famine. Themes of diversification, mobility and flexibility are all important to understanding how people coped with the famine, but this paper focuses on the factor that seemed to determine whether and how well people survived the famine: social connectedness, the extent of the social networks of affected populations, and the ability of these networks to mobilize resources. These factors ultimately determined how well people coped with the famine. The nature of reciprocity, the resources available within people's networks, and the collective risks and hazards faced within networks, all determined people's individual and household outcomes in the famine and are related to the social structures and social hierarchies within Somali society. But these networks had a distinctly negative side as well social identity and social networks were also exploited to trap humanitarian assistance, turn displaced people into ""aid bait,"" and to a large degree, determined who benefited from aid once it started to flow. This paper addresses several questions: How did Somali communities and households cope with the famine of 2011 in the absence of any state-led response and a significant delay in a major international response? What can be learned from these practices to improve our understanding of famine, and of mitigation, response and building resilience to future crises? (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Pastoral community coping and adaptation strategies to manage household food insecurity consequent to climatic hazards in the cattle corridor of Uganda,"Establishing short and long term measures that pastoral and agropastoral households use to ensure they have access to food in periods of climate extremes could provide insights into ways to support households in similar conditions. Using semi-structured elicitation, 15 purposively selected participants from case households and 13 community leaders, in the central cattle corridor of Uganda were interviewed in January to February 2013. Thematic analysis revealed four coping strategies: harvesting immature food crops, selling off cattle, searching for alternative water sources and using alternative non-production-based means to access food. Three adaptation strategies identified were: diversifying livelihood activities, changing agricultural practices and investing in alternative water sources. Several strategies were related to incremental crop system changes, to maintain the existing way of practice. However, some were transformational, like formerly specialized livestock keepers taking on crop farming. Some strategies presented environmentally erosive effects; which could be curbed by evaluating the opportunity cost of diversification and transformative practices in relation to incremental adaptation. Insights gleaned could assist researchers to consider aspects for in-depth adaptation analysis and inform on how policies and institutions in Uganda could be used to facilitate, rather than undermine, pastoralists’ coping and adaptation; and thus guide interventions to strengthen food security. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.9303421842045375,0.24599639482608826,0.09887942841224373,0.559887448267991,0.03976651218902098,0.025682746641298385,0.06319065079877847
"Assessment of climate change awareness and agronomic practices in an agricultural region of Henan Province, China","Agricultural production is a complex interaction between human and natural environment, making agriculture both significantly responsible and vulnerable to climate change. China, whose socioeconomy is fundamentally dependent on agriculture, is already experiencing climate-change-related issues that threaten food security and sustainable development. Climate change mitigation and adaptation are of great concern to ensure food security for the growing population and improve the livelihoods of poor smallholder producers. A questionnaire survey was conducted in Henan Province, China to assess agronomic practices of smallholder farmers, adaptation strategies and how climate change awareness and perceptions influence the farmers' choice of agronomic practices. The results showed that the vast majority of farmers owned < 10 Chinese Mu (0.7 ha) and nearly all farmers' relied on intensive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to increase yield at the detriment of environment. However, farmers who were aware of climate change had adopted agronomic practices that reduce impacts of climate change. Information about climate change, lack of incentives, lack of credit facilities and small farm sizes were major hindrance to adaptation and adoption of farming practices that can reduce impacts of climate change. This study recommends that research findings should be disseminated to farmers in timely and appropriate ways. The central government should formulate policies to include subsidies and incentives for farmers to motivate adoption of eco-friendly agronomic practices.",0.9852891704142969,0.1243793390099028,0.06681548961151444,0.5126578049999304,0.02277077964642265,0.008982500877049344,0.00702561799695939
Climate change-related risks and adaptation strategies as perceived in dairy cattle farming systems in Tunisia,"The perception of risks due to climate change by farmers and the measures they take to address those risks are of paramount importance in policy-making if the implementations of targeted adaptation and mitigation strategies are to be economically and environmentally sustainable. This study focused on Tunisian dairy farmers' perceptions of the risks and the actions taken to cope with changes attributable to climate change. Using a bottom-up approach, 566 surveys were carried out randomly among dairy farmers throughout Tunisia. A total of 70 diagnostic variables relating to farm characteristics, resources, management, performances and profit, in addition to climate change risk perception and adaptation strategies, were identified and analyzed. Using multivariate statistical analysis, four dairy farming groups were identified. The largest proportions of farmers belonged to the two above-ground dairy systems: without utilized agricultural areas; and with non-dairy utilized agricultural areas (Clusters 1 and 2). A minority of farmers belonged to medium-sized and large farms that specialized in milk production (Clusters 3 and 4) and has access to sufficient land, water and capital resources. In all the clusters, almost all the farmers perceived that the greatest impact of climate change would be on cow performance and forage production. The attitudes of the farmers towards adaptation to climate change are associated with farm typology.

Environmental health practitioners potentially play a key role in helping communities adapt to climate change,"BackgroundVulnerable population groups in South Africa, especially those living in poverty, young children, women, the elderly and people with pre-existing diseases, are susceptible to new or exacerbated health threats resulting from climate change. Environmental Health Practitioners (EHPs) can play an important role in helping communities adapt to climate change health impacts, however, effective coordination of this requires further understanding of their roles in implementing climate change-related adaptation actions in communities.MethodsA cross-sectional survey using convenience sampling was undertaken at the January 2017 conference for EHPs hosted by the South African Institute of Environmental Health in Cape Town. All EHPs who attended the conference were invited to complete a study questionnaire that requested information on participant demographics, as well as climate change related-knowledge, practices and perceptions.ResultsMajority of participating EHPs (n=48; 72.8%) had received formal or informal training on climate change and health. Thirty-nine percent of EHPs indicated that they had a climate change and health-related committee / working group in their department, a policy or strategy (41.0%) and budget allocated for climate change and health-related work (51.5%). A total of 33.3% had participated in climate change-related projects. Majority (62.2%) of EHPs believed that they should play a supportive role in addressing climate change while 37.8% believed that EHPs should play a leading role.ConclusionsRecognising the need for raising awareness about climate change adaptation as well as implementing appropriate interventions to combat climate-related ill health effects, especially among vulnerable groups, EHPs are well-placed to adopt significant roles in helping communities to adapt to climate change.",0.2663258088105289,0.4672047734810986,0.09420856222561898,0.2250165020929617,0.053341266018746995,0.08238128481731459,0.024858636496403994
Out-migration from Coastal Areas in Ghana and Indonesia-the Role of Environmental Factors,"Projections of climatic and environmental changes have generated a growing effort to assess their implications for human migration. Because migration is always a multicausal phenomenon, this study aims to disentangle the impact of environmental factors from other migration-inducing factors to shed some light on the complex relationship between the environment and migration. Thus, we conducted quantitative microlevel studies in low-lying communities in two high-mobility countries-Ghana and Indonesia-that are particularly exposed to coastal hazards like erosion, land subsidence, storm surges and an increasing sea level, and are prone to flooding on a regular basis. Different measures of environmental threats were collected, ranging from individual perceptions over the household's distance to the coast to expert opinions. We analyzed the relationships using logistic regressions and controlled for contextual factors on multiple levels. No statistically significant direct impacts of slow-onset environmental events on migration decisions could be detected. Perceptions of storms, a clearly sudden-onset event, however, were found to be significantly linked to out-migration decisions in Ghana. These findings support the hypothesis that environmental factors are generally not a primary cause of migration, and their effects are rather context specific-especially for slow-onset changes.

Eco-adaptation strategies of health to climate change: Case of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) as vulnerability indicatorin Pre-Saharan region of Morocco,"Human societies are rapidly increasing in size, driving with them the level of appropriation of Earth’s resources, including land use. Today, human influence has reached global proportions and has altered ecosystems with consequences for local and regional climates. These changes in climates often alter the biosphere’s ecosystem services and social livelihood; and in some cases they strongly affect human security, including publichealth. For example, in Pre-Saharan North Africashifts in surface climate associated with climate change may have altered the dynamic of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL), a vectorial disease causing threat to health security in most North African countries. Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease widespread in most countries of the Mediterranean basin, including Morocco where it causes a public health problem that is worsening with changes in climate and unsustainable population activities. ZCL is a form of leishmaniasis endemic in south-east Morocco, especially in the province of Errachidia. Caused by Leishmania major, this form is transmitted by Phlebotomus (Phlebotomus) papatasi (Diptera: Psychodidae), with Meriones shawi grandisthe main reservoir host. This investigation is carried out in the province of Errachidia with the aim to assess the vulnerability of local populations to ZCL, as influenced by climate change, and identify potential adaptation strategies susceptible to reduce the risk of infection. Our research is based on extensive interviews with local populations, particularly about their behavior and their interactions with local environment changes. It also refers to reports from the Moroccan Ministry of Health on the prevalence of disease and socio-economic data from the region. As results, we report on micro-environmental and socio-economic aspects that may act as risk factors conditioning the resurgence of this parasitic disease. It is a contribution that raises the flag about ZCL in order to develop an eco-health approach and determine adaptation procedures able to reduce the sensitivity and exposure of vulnerable populations. Based on population perceptions, the relationship between the transmission cycle of disease, environment and local population was discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",0.4658348595613202,0.4159142498047519,0.1376685418397606,0.32304892851428463,0.0689185095014592,0.07873745340974667,0.07062936688813524
"One option, two countries, several strategies: subjacent mechanisms of assisted migration implementation in Canada and France","Climate change obliges societies to develop adaptive strategies in order to maintain sustainable management of resources and landscapes. However, the development and implementation of these strategies require dialogue between researchers and policy-makers about what they understand for adaptation. This dialogue can be hindered by language differences, the hidden agendas, and conflicting concerns of those involved. In this research study, we explored the mechanisms that underlie the implementation process of assisted migration (AM), an adaptation strategy that aims to limit the impact of climate change. We conducted a comparative analysis of 80 semistructured interviews with actors in the forestry sectors in Canada and France. In Canada, our results show a division between the provinces strategies, causing a debate about AM because researchers are wary of the geoengineering and economic arguments that frame AM in areas where the effects of climate change remain unclear. In contrast, we found that the observation of climate impacts is a strong trigger for the application of AM despite an awareness of its associated risks. In France, we explained the absence of AM implementation by a lack of information flow between research and foresters regarding the concept of AM, a cultural attachment of French foresters to their forest landscapes and that climate change effects are not clear yet. Clarity on what implies a true ecological engineering approach in ecological restoration can help maintaining adaptive actions like AM within the general scope of ecosystem management and minimize simplistic applications of adaptation strategies because of climate change.",0.37835022931053097,0.32750408872717435,0.23144234758651422,0.22524702135571784,0.06163684978147501,0.12206653822336393,0.06319359314986508
Institutional barriers for the implementation of climate change adaptation actions in the Mexican coastal zones,"This paper has as its object of study the coastal and marine areas of Mexico; specifically, it focuses on the analysis of existing barriers for the implementation of actions tending to the adaptation to climate change of these fragile and dynamic regions of the national territory. The study makes a general review of the main meetings, agreements and international entities related to the global climate that have served as the basis for the XXI Conference of the Parties, from which emanated the ""Paris Agreement"". After analyzing some implications of the aforementioned agreement and presenting evidence of the current situation, the main legal and normative instruments of the national marine and coastal areas are reviewed; the main risks in these areas of the national territory associated with climate change are evaluated; the main existing adaptation measures are analyzed; and, the most important socioeconomic and political barriers that exist for their correct implementation are established.

Climate Change Perceptions and Observations of Agricultural Stakeholders in the Northern Great Plains,"This study explored whether Montana agricultural stakeholders' perceptions and observations of climate change vary according to four socio-ecological variables: income, political view, agricultural occupation, and production region. A survey including 27 questions was developed into five sections: (1) agricultural background information; (2) perceptions about climate change; (3) observed changes in climate-related variables; (4) adaptation practices and strategies; and (5) demographic information. The survey included Likert-scored responses and multiple-choice questions, and was completed by 452 participants, including conventional and organic farmers and ranchers, extension agents, crop consultants, and researchers. The results indicate that while a notable fraction of agricultural stakeholders are alarmed about climate change and optimistic about the human capacity to reduce climate change, the degree of concern and optimism significantly varies depending on the stakeholder's political views, production region, and agricultural occupation group. We found that observations of changes in climate, perceptions about climate change, and potential risks to agricultural production are driven mainly by political views. Both perceptions and observations drive the choice of adaptation and mitigation practices. It is thus essential to understand farmers' socio-ecological characteristics when designing agricultural outreach programs in order to reduce barriers for the adoption of climate-resilient agriculture.",0.9662299624566898,0.20115001667547333,0.1084626069472618,0.44299123927515927,0.022746778002174943,0.010763274064351808,0.03086771853795539
Coastal adaptation to climate change in Aotearoa-New Zealand,"The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports conclude that for Australasia, without adaptation, further changes in climate, atmospheric CO2, sea-level rise and ocean acidity are projected to have substantial impacts on climate sensitive systems, sectors and populations. In the context of varying geographical, social, cultural and policy contexts, this paper reviews research contributions and activities concerning coastal adaptation to climate change in Aotearoa-New Zealand. It reflects on the insights derived from this emerging pool of scholarship and considers what lessons have been learned to help us address the future challenges of adaptation to climate change on our coasts and estuaries. In particular, future progress will require strong understanding of natural coastal systems, clearer national direction and guidance in balance with regional flexibility, and collaborative processes to help communities understand, implement and evaluate adaptation pathways for a sustainable and resilient future.",0.20120696355705112,0.439720894048962,0.13749455792886392,0.26416303258095136,0.24745536121565193,0.21854048176469784,0.1047849657546594
Vulnerability and adaptation strategies of coastal communities to the associated impacts of sea level rise and coastal flooding,"This study aimed to assess the vulnerability of selected communities of the island to the impacts of sea level rise and associated coastal flooding, to examine the perception of local communities of North and South Regions of Pemba Island on the occurrence and impact of coastal flooding to their wellbeing and, lastly, to evaluate the adaptive capacity and different adaptation strategies adopted by the local communities in response to coastal flooding in the two administrative regions of Pemba Island. Within each district, three rice-growing areas were purposely selected for the study. Data collection techniques used included interviews, FGDs and physical observation. A total of 140 individuals were interviewed. Findings show that rice farmers in Pemba were highly exposed to sea level rise and coastal floods. As rice farming in the island is entirely rainfed, the rice-growing areas were sensitive to both declining rainfall and coastal flooding. Poor economic conditions and high levels of poverty exacerbated the low capacity of these communities to respond to the impacts of these stressors. Their vulnerability was manifested in overdependence on fishing, seaweed farming and subsistence crop farming which are highly impacted by sea level rise and associated coastal flooding. The observed building of seawalls was contributing to ameliorations of the impacts of coastal floods. There was a need to extend these walls to other villages for a similar purpose. Adaptation options such as the introduction of alternative sources of income or changing the use of the affected rice farms could also help to build resilience amongst rice farmers and thus reducing vulnerability to impacts of climate change. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",0.6177124000935468,0.35713728127027017,0.05968782356823516,0.3623225783706524,0.6812904715035178,0.3377910689781752,0.13190559553406692
"""The floods came and we lost everything': weather extremes and households' asset vulnerability and adaptation in rural Ghana","Extreme weather events such as flooding have been observed to deplete households' assets and render households vulnerable to shocks and poverty. Few empirical studies have however examined households' asset vulnerability and adaptation to such extreme events in Ghana. Based on qualitative research with two ecologically fragile communities in Ghana, this paper explores the asset vulnerability and adaptation strategies of households against periodic flooding. Findings suggested that households' assets most vulnerable to flooding were farmlands, human health, housing and financial savings. However, flooding did not affect households' assets equally; the effects were gendered and differentiated, often occasioned by inequalities in exposure, vulnerability, access to resources, capabilities and opportunities. Nonetheless, many households are actively adapting their assets by acquiring new knowledge about early warning systems, employing different farming practices and diversifying their assets. Understanding the differences in households' asset vulnerability as well as in the priorities that men and women, as well as the young and old, place on different asset adaptation strategies could therefore be important in the effectiveness of climate change adaptation as well as the sustainability of communities.",0.4792306555969966,0.3847901230857583,0.08053470030612932,0.610880043506063,0.09588833877780477,0.08420535917768833,0.1809909297012947

Gender dimensions of climate change adaptation practices: the experiences of smallholder crop farmers in the transition zone of Ghana,"This paper discusses the gender dimensions of climate change adaptation strategies among small holder crop farmers in the transition zone of Ghana. A total of 612 farmers (328 females and 284 males) were interviewed using purposive sampling technique. Our results indicate that adaptation strategies are gendered with men mostly resorting to on-farm agronomic practices such as the use of artificial fertilizers and also moving into new cash crops. Female farmers also use similar on-farm agronomic practices particularly artificial fertilizers to boost crop production but most importantly resorted to petty trading in agricultural and consumable goods, an off-farm strategy. This shows women's resilience which has also subsequently improved their decision-making role at the household level, which is an indicator of empowerment. We recommend that institutions that support climate change adaptation initiatives at the local level must take gender differences into consideration and support particularly women to strengthen their resilience and consolidate their empowerment.",0.9263819298237357,0.203159518940028,0.06190363893916175,0.6138663498060872,0.030881465900354167,0.026469319666292127,0.03557766917930579
Adaptive governance: Livelihood innovation for climate resilience in Uganda,"Adaptive governance is the use of novel approaches within policy to support experimentation and learning. Social learning reflects the engagement of interdependent stakeholders within this learning. Much attention has focused on these concepts as a solution for resilience in governing institutions in an uncertain climate; resilience representing the ability of a system to absorb shock and to retain its function and form through reorganisation. However, there are still many questions to how these concepts enable resilience, particularly in vulnerable, developing contexts. A case study from Uganda presents how these concepts promote resilient livelihood outcomes among rural subsistence farmers within a decentralised governing framework. This approach has the potential to highlight the dynamics and characteristics of a governance system which may manage change. The paper draws from the enabling characteristics of adaptive governance, including lower scale dynamics of bonding and bridging ties and strong leadership. Central to these processes were learning platforms promoting knowledge transfer leading to improved self-efficacy, innovation and livelihood skills. However even though aspects of adaptive governance were identified as contributing to resilience in livelihoods, some barriers were identified. Reflexivity and multi-stakeholder collaboration were evident in governing institutions; however, limited self-organisation and vertical communication demonstrated few opportunities for shifts in governance, which was severely challenged by inequity, politicisation and elite capture. The paper concludes by outlining implications for climate adaptation policy through promoting the importance of mainstreaming adaptation alongside existing policy trajectories; highlighting the significance of collaborative spaces for stakeholders and the tackling of inequality and corruption.

"Global changes, livestock and vulnerability: the social construction of markets as an adaptive strategy","Nowadays, livestock producers in Sahel have to deal not only with climate variability but also with changes in land use and policies that restrict access to pasture and increase their vulnerability. At the same time, the growth of urban livestock markets both nationwide and in neighbouring countries is creating opportunities for producers. However, few studies have examined the role of markets in the adaptive strategies of livestock producers in West Africa, the changes in strategies for capturing market opportunities and the social interactions that lead to changes in market access and functioning. This paper addresses the question of how livestock producers and traders have transformed their producing and marketing strategies in response to climate variability and land access constraints. Our proposed conceptual framework on markets, vulnerability and adaptation considers that adaptive strategies include the social construction of markets through which market access is based on social networks and follows the norms and rules embedded in the complexity of these networks. This proactive strategy of stakeholders, through a socially constructed market access, allows traders to harness opportunities and livestock producers to adapt to climatic and land access constraints. We apply the framework in a case study in the region of Niono and Segou in the Niger Inner delta in Mali. Results show that livestock producers and traders have changed their livestock-raising and marketing strategies in response to the challenges faced by livestock producers and the emerging market opportunities. This study highlights the importance of considering the social construction of livestock market systems and marketing behaviours as adaptive strategies of livestock producers to multiple changes. Although livestock markets can support the adaptive strategies of several types of producers, their functioning as institutions has been understudied and scantily addressed in policy.",0.841771843659869,0.29170937495713456,0.14773089113274854,0.5754014481708478,0.05730059896523778,0.03806968096408052,0.03671176896331715
The Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative as an opportunity to enhance resilience in Sahelian landscapes and livelihoods,"Over the past 50years, a large number of development initiatives have addressed the diverse social and ecological challenges in the Sahel, often focusing on a single entry point or action, resulting in only a limited degree of success. Within the last decade, the international development discourse has evolved to incorporate resilience thinking as a way to address more complex challenges. However, concrete examples as to how to operationalize resilience thinking are lacking. The Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative (GGW), a pan-African program with a strong reforestation focus, is the latest and most ambitious of these development programs to date. The GGW represents an ideal opportunity to apply resilience thinking at a large scale, but in order to do so, it must intelligently gather and centralize pre-existing interdisciplinary knowledge, generate new knowledge, and integrate knowledge systems to appropriately navigate future uncertainties of the diverse social-ecological systems along its path. Herein, after a brief description of large-scale reforestation history in the Sahara and Sahel and the conceptual evolution of the GGW, we propose a transdisciplinary research framework with resilience thinking at its core. It includes analysis of complex social-ecological systems, their temporal and spatial cross-scale interactions, and outcomes focused on the supply of abundant, diverse, equitable, and durable ecosystem services to support livelihoods in the region. If the research areas that comprise the framework were to be properly addressed, they could conceivably guide GGW actions in a way that would contribute to desirable future pathways.",0.3477872830600818,0.3620306212197929,0.17621807150076887,0.40546401578465463,0.12040097844549631,0.11189456704057002,0.0676587929462762
Household's socio-economic factors influencing the level of adaptation to climate variability in the dry zones of Eastern Kenya,"Climate variability has a negative impact on crop productivity and has had an effect on many smallholder farmers in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs). Small-holder farmers in Eastern Kenya are faced with the constraint associated with climate variability and have consequently made effort at local level to utilize adaptation techniques in their quest to adapt to climate variability. However, documentation of the factors that influence the level of adaptation to climate variability in the study area is quite limited. Hence, this study aimed at assessing how the household's socio-economic factors influence the level of adaptation to climate variability. The study sites were Tharaka and Kitui-Central sub-Counties in Tharaka-Nithi and Kitui Counties of Eastern Kenya respectively. The data collected included the household demographic and socio-economic characteristics and farmers' adaptation techniques to cope with climate variability. Triangulation approach research design was used to simultaneously collect both quantitative and qualitative data. Primary data was gathered through a household survey. Both random and purposive sampling strategies were employed. Data analysis was done using descriptive and inferential statistics. Multinomial and Binary logistic regression models were used to predict the influence of socioeconomic characteristics on the level of adaptation to climate variability. This was done using variables derived through a data reduction process that employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The study considered five strategies as measures of the level of adaptation to climate variability; crop adjustment; crop management; soil fertility management; water harvesting and crop types; boreholes and crop variety. Several factors were found significant in predicting the level of adaptation to climate variability as being either low or medium relative to high. These were average size of land under maize; farming experience; household size; household members involved in farming; education level; age; main occupation and gender of the household head. Household socio economic factors found significant in explaining the level of adaptation should be considered in any efforts that aim to promote adaptation to climate variability in the agricultural sector amongst smallholder farmers.

THE CONCEPT OF CLIMATE RESILIENT ECONOMY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES,"The concept of a climate-resilient economy appeared prominently in the 2015 economic considerations in the context of the Paris Agreement. However, the very concept of resiliency emerged in the 1970s in ecological research and was also widely considered from the perspective of socio-economic development. This paper presents the objectives of the European Union policy related to the creation of climate-resilient economies and the rationale behind the concept of resiliency.

Crop variety management for climate adaptation supported by citizen science,"Crop adaptation to climate change requires accelerated crop variety introduction accompanied by recommendations to help farmers match the best variety with their field contexts. Existing approaches to generate these recommendations lack scalability and predictivity in marginal production environments. We tested if crowdsourced citizen science can address this challenge, producing empirical data across geographic space that, in aggregate, can characterize varietal climatic responses. We present the results of 12,409 farmer-managed experimental plots of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Nicaragua, durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) in Ethiopia, and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in India. Farmers collaborated as citizen scientists, each ranking the performance of three varieties randomly assigned from a larger set. We show that the approach can register known specific effects of climate variation on varietal performance. The prediction of variety performance from seasonal climatic variables was generalizable across growing seasons. We show that these analyses can improve variety recommendations in four aspects: reduction of climate bias, incorporation of seasonal climate forecasts, risk analysis, and geographic extrapolation. Variety recommendations derived from the citizen science trials led to important differences with previous recommendations.",0.745601054093452,0.25241675554498755,0.10632438565877522,0.36135075712343795,0.04408909861040342,0.07322725199598129,0.05674909312039684
"Early warning, resilient infrastructure and risk transfer","Strengthening the capacity of countries and communities to cope with the adverse effects of natural hazards and at the same time support development objectives requires investment in early warning; resilient infrastructure and financial risk transfer mechanisms. By shifting emphasis from hazard warnings to impact-based warnings, hazard, vulnerability and exposure information become central to all three components and can be used to improve the utility of each.

An Agent-Based Model of Rural Households' Adaptation to Climate Change,"Future climate change is expected to have greater impacts on societies whose livelihoods rely on subsistence agricultural systems. Adaptation is essential for mitigating adverse effects of climate change, to sustain rural livelihoods and ensure future food security. We present an agent-based model, called OMOLAND-CA, which explores the impact of climate change on the adaptive capacity of rural communities in the South Omo Zone of Ethiopia. The purpose of the model is to answer research questions on the resilience and adaptive capacity of rural households with respect to variations in climate, socioeconomic factors, and land-use at the local level. Our model explicitly represents the socio-cognitive behavior of rural households toward climate change and resource flows that prompt agents to diversify their production strategy under different climatic conditions. Results from the model show that successive episodes of extreme events (e.g., droughts) affect the adaptive capacity of households, causing them to migrate from the region. Nonetheless, rural communities in the South Omo Zone, and in the model, manage to endure in spite of such harsh climatic change conditions.",0.8357785665129254,0.3542131362227068,0.11931404728941357,0.5653087734747624,0.05330772732836023,0.028803304348793177,0.14432852870613402
Putting uncertainty under the cultural lens of Traditional Owners from the Great Barrier Reef Catchments,"Indigenous peoples in Australia, and globally, are situated in an unusual context of both significant vulnerability and unique resilience to climate change which influence their perceptions of climate risk and uncertainty. Their vulnerability to climate change arises in part from their contexts of living in many of the harshest and isolated environments. Their resilience originates from their accumulated knowledge of specific environments over millennia, mediated through sui generis cultural institutions. Our results illustrate that indigenous groups primarily perceive uncertainties related to volition of actors and institutions. When they are involved in climate adaptation planning in ways that mobilise their cultural institutions and knowledge, they can safely manage these uncertainties through their agency to determine and control key risks. We demonstrate that climate justice approaches can be strengthened for indigenous peoples by applying a linked vulnerability-resilience analytical framework. This enables stronger consideration of how unique cultural institutions and knowledge, which are not available to all vulnerable groups, affect indigenous perceptions of uncertainty in climate adaptation planning. We use this analytical approach in a case study with Yuibera and Koinmerburra Traditional Owner groups within the Great Barrier Reef Catchment. We conclude that a specific focus on sui generis indigenous knowledge and cultural institutions as a source of resilience can strengthen climate justice approaches and work more effectively with indigenous peoples in climate change contexts.",0.39714286852374353,0.4340251644116451,0.1968197096761612,0.328534695759828,0.11396182765621939,0.10883078107964023,0.10067556659114045
Agro-pastoralists' determinants of adaptation to climate change,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyze smallholder farmers' perceptions on climate change and its stressors, their adaptation strategies and factors that influence their adaptation to climate change. Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted in Kweneng district, located in the south eastern part of Botswana. Multi-stage sampling was used to obtain a representative sample from three sub-districts in the district. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data by using face-to-face interviews. Findings Majority of farmers perceived an increase in mean annual temperature and the number of hot days and a decrease in mean annual rainfall and the number of rainfall days over the past 10 years as indicators of climate change. The prominent adaptation strategies included changes in planting dates for crops and supplementary feeding for livestock. The logistic regression results show that gender, age, household size, poverty, shortage of land, mixed farming and knowledge about climate change significantly influence adaptation. Practical implications The findings indicate that climate change policy should target agricultural diversification at the household level and dissemination of information on climate change and adaptation strategies. Originality/value Policy recommendations can be suggested: government climate change interventions should target agricultural diversification at the household level, and this study provides insights on what influences adaptation strategies and what should be targeted to build resilience in the agricultural sector.",0.9469652931272966,0.174527963816194,0.06119595327179702,0.5955790885445426,0.04221835248155453,0.0315878740811325,0.023849427036979627
Identifying drivers of household coping strategies to multiple climatic hazards in Western Uganda: implications for adapting to future climate change,"This paper investigates what drives household coping strategies in rural Uganda under different climatic hazards. Rural households in sub-Saharan Africa draw on various coping strategies to reduce the impact of climatic hazards on their livelihoods. Research to date provides only limited understanding of how the coping strategy portfolio of households changes depending on the climatic stress. Using empirical data from Uganda, this research contributes to this gap by (1) exploring how household coping strategy relates to household characteristics and livelihood activity and (2) how these coping strategies vary depending on the hazard. Coping strategy is found to be hazard specific for households that lack market-orientated activities, whereas those with market access rely on economic activities regardless of hazard. To maintain and improve the livelihoods and coping strategies of those most vulnerable to climatic variability and change, policies that advocate diversification away from a sole reliance on customary activities need to recognize the level and opportunity for market-based activities. These interventions must account for different sensitivities to different hazards as well as the homogeneity of the community in order to effectively support rural communities to cope with climate variability.",0.6914158449968762,0.29095697219341826,0.06880211179024452,0.7235418128657253,0.05427394871038268,0.032692999147699235,0.10331586580407022

A Resilience Approach to Community-Scale Climate Adaptation,"Climate risk is expected to impact rural communities in West Africa in multiple ways. However, most current research addresses resilience and climate adaptation at either the national or the household scale; very little is known about community-scale interventions. We interviewed 934 community members in six communities in southeastern Nigeria about sources of climate risk and community-based actions for climate change adaptation. We found these communities contained multiple active and engaged groups that have implemented a wide range of interventions to reduce climate risk, most of which are seen as effective by community members. Flooding was the most common form of risk in this region, but drought, windstorms, and irregular rainy seasons are also frequent, implying that effective climate adaptation will have to be sensitive to multiple types of risk. Structural interventions (constructing roads, bridges, etc.) were the most common type of intervention, suggesting that communities are capable of marshalling considerable organizational and human power for adaptation efforts, even in the absence of external assistance. Efforts to boost community resilience and adaptation to climate change would benefit from first understanding what community actions are currently underway, and working with the groups implementing these actions to support and extend them.",0.33959482113904976,0.4105333156139222,0.10869619057708908,0.4107518355316294,0.08933370394207091,0.14517101202847205,0.13934193672770515
The role of community-based watershed development in reducing farmers' vulnerability to climate change and variability in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia,"Community-based watershed development (CBWD) has been implemented in Ethiopia since the last three decades. However, the benefits of these watershed development interventions for climate change adaptation are not well documented. This study, therefore, assesses the contributions of CBWD in reducing farmers' vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and variability in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. Data were collected from systematically selected 157 households using questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of questions on climate, ecosystem and households' livelihood capital. Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change Livelihood Vulnerability Index (IPCC-LVI) methods were used to generate vulnerability indices. Vulnerability indices computed for three conserved watersheds were compared with one non-conserved watershed using one-way ANOVA test. LVI score for ecosystem related indicators was significantly low for Adef Wuha compared to the non-conserved watershed. Similarly, LVI scores generated from agriculture, wealth and social indicators were low for Tija Baji and Guansa watersheds. On the other hand, the IPCC-LVI result did not show significant differences in exposure; however, sensitivity scores of conserved watersheds were significantly lower compared to the non-conserved. The adaptive capacities of two conserved watersheds (Guansa and Tija Baji) were also significantly lower as compared to the non-conserved. The overall (composite) vulnerability of watersheds generated from both methods (LVI and IPCC-LVI) showed that the conserved watersheds were less vulnerable to climate change compared to the non-conserved. The findings suggest that CBWD is an important strategy to reduce vulnerability of smallholder farmers to the ongoing and future climate change.",0.8647056994446671,0.299032724689021,0.14318167025677125,0.5,0.051439604804249195,0.03989463844498506,0.1332835537609052
Sand and Dust Storms: Impact Mitigation,"Sand and dust storms (SDS) play an integral role in the Earth system but they also present a range of hazards to the environmental and economic sustainability of human society. These hazards are of considerable importance for residents of dryland environments and also affect people beyond drylands because wind erosion can occur in most environments and desert dust events often involve long-range transport over great distances (>1000 km). This paper makes an assessment of the scale of SDS impacts by totalling the countries affected using an appraisal of peer-reviewed published sources, arriving at a conservative estimate that 77% of all parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) are affected directly by SDS issues. We then present a synthesis of the environmental management techniques designed to mitigate SDS hazards for disaster risk reduction and review policy measures, both historical and contemporary, for SDS impact mitigation. Although many SDS hazards are well-known, the processes involved and their impacts are not all equally well-understood. Policies designed to mitigate the impacts of wind erosion in agricultural areas have been developed in certain parts of the world but policies designed to mitigate the wider impacts of SDS, including many that are transboundary, are geographically patchy and have a much shorter history. Further development and wider implementation of such policies is advocated because of the recent marked increase in wind erosion and associated dust storms in several parts of the world.",0.2615160594434486,0.3712027877228708,0.15376552131262497,0.3155814285102823,0.1369283492942836,0.187292000821151,0.16046125947214757
Understanding gender dimensions of agriculture and climate change in smallholder farming communities,"In Uganda, Ghana and Bangladesh, participatory tools were used for a socio-economic and gender analysis of three topics: climate-smart agriculture (CSA), climate analogue approaches, and climate and weather forecasting. Policy and programme-relevant results were obtained. Smallholders are changing agricultural practices due to observations of climatic and environmental change. Women appear to be less adaptive because of financial or resource constraints, because of male domination in receiving information and extension services and because available adaptation strategies tend to create higher labour loads for women. The climate analogue approach (identifying places resembling your future climate so as to identify potential adaptations) is a promising tool for increasing farmer-to-farmer learning, where a high degree of climatic variability means that analogue villages that have successfully adopted new CSA practices exist nearby. Institutional issues related to forecast production limit their credibility and salience, particularly in terms of women's ability to access and understand them. The participatory tools used in this study provided some insights into women's adaptive capacity in the villages studied, but not to the depth necessary to address women's specific vulnerabilities in CSA programmes. Further research is necessary to move the discourse related to gender and climate change beyond the conceptualization of women as a homogenously vulnerable group in CSA programmes.",0.7358780867670821,0.32805962086855206,0.12161014211655499,0.5827971361962859,0.03828207866710735,0.021713504450521018,0.06633525001128346
Understanding regional effects on climate change and multidisciplinary approarch for coping strategies - Case study at rural village in Sub-Saharan Africa,"This paper describes on understanding the regional effects on global climate change and subsistence farmers' coping strategies through our field investigation and multidimensional data analysis from the resilience point of view. The major research question of this study is to understand what actions villagers took as the coping strategy against the heavy rainfall shock caused by climate change. Our research interest is how geospatial information technique can contribute to this research question. The study area is located in Sinazongwe district, Southern province of Zambia. As for the field investigation, we set the study sites A, B and C where are located in the lower terrace, middle escarpment and upper terrace, respectively. In the rainy season of 2007/2008, our study site had a heavy rainfall and many crop fields were damaged. In this crop year, the annual rainfalls in site A and C were 1442mm/year and 1332mm/year respectively. This is about two times different with the long term average of rainfall 694.9 mm/year in Sinazongwe district. It is confirmed that approximately 20% of crop fields were damaged by heavy rainfall through our field investigation. It was so severe negative consequences for all of villages because about 80 % of whole damaged crop fields were maize fields. Maize is staple food in this region. Here, we have analysed and discussed how villagers cope from the serious damage of crops. The maize harvest varies every year depending on rainfall and topographic position. If a farmer possesses maize fields at various topographic positions, they can avoid severe negative consequences of climate variability such as drought or heavy rainfall. However, not all farmers have access to fields at various topographic positions. It is important to know where each household's characteristics when we consider their strategy of livelihood for climate variabilities. Through this study, we confirmed the way to strengthen resilience of subsistence farmers as follows: it is necessary to prepare variable crops and emergency food stock with not only diverse but also composite social institution. The resilient society seems to be the society with insurance such as adaptation ability against environmental shock caused by climate change. From the agricultural production point of view, both diversity and yield ability are also important. © Authors 2018.

Location factors and spatial dependence in household perceptions and adaptations to climate change: A case in the upper Blue Nile Basin,"Studies on perceptions of, and adaptation responses to, climate change have not paid sufficient attention to location and neighbourhood effects. Moreover, although one often regards perceptions as preconditions for adaptation, some direct and underlying factors may influence perceptions and adaptations in opposite ways. To assess determinants of perceived directions of climate change and adaptations by farmers, the paper formulates ordered response and multinomial choice models accounting for the location and neighbourhood effects. Relative to a survey of rural households in the Ethiopian Nile basin, perceptions of long-term climate trends are found to substantially vary across regions, altitudes, distances from markets, and neighbourhood characteristics, with climate reference scales being themselves non-uniform across respondents. The inclusion of proxies for local spatial dependence and clustering in multinomial logit regressions on adaptation decisions provides further insights, relative to individual- and farm-specific features. Adaptation measures turn out to be largely independent from degree of awareness of negative trends in climate changes. This highlights the importance of adaptive strategies coordinated at regional and national scale, such as preventive measures of control of pest damage risk due to increasing temperatures, and specific interventions for semi-arid agro-climatic zones.",0.832410232394583,0.2573794925684922,0.10862869157284395,0.40597407515042816,0.06130319154041808,0.057428701904965705,0.16820258365015392

Making adaptation fit: Analysis of joint climate change adaptation programs of the mdgf,"Climate change adaptation governance is characterized by complexity and uncertainty, requiring harmonization across different sectors and scales as well as flexibility to respond to changing realities. International organizations have been increasingly involved in adaptation activities, particularly targeted at vulnerable populations, under established project management routines. However, to be effective, adaptation must be inherently context specific and dynamic to suit the ecological conditions and socioeconomic aspects of any given locale. This poses a dilemma: how can international organizations translate their often broadly defined global mandates, while simultaneously downscaling those mandates to suit the specific adaptation needs of given populations and ecosystems? This research takes a case study approach to investigate the climate change adaptation experience of selected United Nations-led programs, investigating their responses to context-specific needs and highlighting the opportunities and challenges found in these experiences. The case study countries comprised of Bosnia and Herzegovina, China, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Jordan, Mauritania, Mozambique, Peru, and Turkey. Through the use of the 5C+ Protocol theoretical framework, the experiences of these country programs were compared to determine which factors were of greatest influence in successful program implementation. The research concludes that the most significant challenges were: early inclusion of stakeholders to enable support and ownership of adaptation activities, meaningful participation by people at all levels in the identification of problems and solutions, and proper coordination of activities across affected sectors and governance levels. Paying specific attention to these challenges will allow for greater program effectiveness. However, incorporating such measures into adaptation must also include deliberate learning processes, to allow flexibility in response to potential nonlinearities of climate change. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",0.254308099236355,0.35845950878274696,0.17410599453433123,0.2662875491543565,0.10254193765351839,0.16881683981746548,0.13726171986343774
Factors affecting smallholder farmers' adaptation to climate change through non-technological adjustments,"Smallholder farmers often employ inputs and practices they are traditionally well acquainted with to adapt to climate change. These types of adjustments, henceforth referred to as non-technological, are not only more feasible in the resource-constrained situation of smallholder farmers but also have a potential to significantly reduce the negative impact of climate change. However, a systematic study of these types of adaptations isolating them from technological ones is still lacking. While technological adaptations can benefit from the extensive literature on the adoption of agricultural technologies, non-technological adaptations still need further examination as one distinct group of adjustments. We hypothesize that this group of adaptations strongly depend on farmers' accumulated experience rather than financial resources and level of schooling. To test this hypothesis, we compared the determinants of changing planting date and changing crop type as non-technological adaptations, with the determinants of two technological adaptations: fertilizer use and rainwater harvesting. The investigation relied on a survey of 270 farm households in Semien Shewa Zone of Ethiopia. We used Wilcoxon Signed rank test and verified the importance of climate change in inducing the adjustments. A Multivariate probit model was then used to identify their determinants. Our hypothesis is supported by a positive relationship between farm experience and changing planting date, while fertilizer and rainwater harvesting showed a positive correlation with access to credit and level of schooling respectively. Our findings suggest that targeting non-technological farm-level adaptations through interventions focused on experience sharing can alone play an important role in reducing the impact of climate change in agriculture.",0.9466925692467897,0.22884638917550965,0.1140162031405054,0.5897157694690279,0.04045554847240783,0.024965385282608808,0.03491670652784803
West African Farmers' Climate Change Adaptation: From Technological Change Towards Transforming Institutions,"The effects of climate change are widely threatening West African farming. The case of the farmers in the West African Sudan savannah is particularly severe due to the specific ecological vulnerability and the political and socioeconomic instability in the region. Since 2012, the West African Science Service on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) has been leading a regional effort to enhance the understanding, data availability and building capabilities to strengthen the ability of agricultural systems in coping with the effects of climate change. One of the activities focuses on determining the drivers of farmers' adaptation. The case studies in this research in Benin and Burkina Faso identified major climate hazards, farmers' perceptions and adaptation measures. Research methods included ethnography, quantitative and mixed analyses. Results show mixed mainstream and specific perceptions of climate change and its effects. The mainly perceived impacts relate to yield decline, pest increase and water scarcity. Adaptation is widespread, but practices are diverse and often neither correlated with the type of hazards nor with impacts. This indicates that it is necessary to acknowledge the role of adaptation to problems not only caused by climate change, and to consider adaptation as an enhancing factor of social-ecological resilience. Furthermore, the focus on technological changes in the local context should be directed towards enhancing adaptive and transforming institutions. Ongoing studies on agroforestry, subsidies provision and livestock demonstrate such strategies.",0.8637113988551016,0.2381277062758256,0.12883112251477252,0.4526502471683892,0.04426167980554504,0.030325332685884145,0.07270570233074614
Farmers' Responses to Changing Hydrological Trends in the Niger Basin Parts of Benin,"Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change given its low capacities of resilience to the enormous challenges climate change will pose. Research aimed at evaluating changes in hydrological trends and methods of adaptation was conducted in the Niger Basin parts of Benin at the peak of the rainy season in the year 2012. Rainfall and river discharge were analyzed from 1950-2010 in order to generate patterns of changes in the region. Structured questionnaires were used to evaluate the perceptions of 14 farming communities on climate-related issues and their methods of adaptations. Mann-Kendall and Pettit trend analyses were conducted for rainfall and river discharge. The findings indicated that significant decreases characterized rainfall and river discharge in the period of study. Flash flood was considered the major challenge faced in the region according to more than 90% of crop, animal, and fish farmers. Aside from that, decrease in water availability was identified as an additional challenge. Irrigation, diversification, water treatment, drainage, small dams, and dikes were reported as the common adaptation mechanisms in the catchments.

"Bottom-""wide"" approach to climate change - typology and analysis on climate vulnerability reduction through voluntary actions","Climate change risk is mostly and often unfairly cast upon those who are vulnerable. As one of the effective and spreadable means in reducing human vulnerability to climate change, this paper and its findings address the role, strength and limitations of voluntary actions. Through an extensive review of various climate change literature, projects and interviews among practitioners, the authors looked at thetypes of interventions and results that voluntary actions have achieved. The paperintroducesvarious types of voluntary activities such as awareness raising, community mobilization and empowerment, community-based adaptation and mitigation, and voluntary environmental regulations and schemes. Such bottom-""wide"" approach to climate change is closely linked with civil environmentalism with broad focus and also scientifically strengthened by its engagement with civic science. It urges shifting the mind-set of international development agencies to flexibly accommodate and maximize the potential of voluntary, bottom-wide actions in combating climate change.

"Climate adaptation at what scale? Multi-level governance, resilience, and coproduction in Saint Louis, Senegal","This paper utilizes a multi-level governance framework to explain how and at what scale climate adaptation, exemplified by flood risk management, was governed in the medium-scale city of Saint Louis, Senegal. It explores how this policy sector worked toward a ""resilient city'' pointing to gaps between governance as prescribed and as practiced. The paper suggests that strong coordination of climate change adaptation and flood risk management should take place at city level, reflecting the ""place-based'' character of these policy sectors. However, adaptation cannot be addressed successfully at any single geographic scale or by any one category of actor. Effective collaboration across politico-administrative boundaries at multiple scales is required in order to address tensions between competing policy agendas and tackle socio-spatial inequality and vulnerability. We found that public officials at the city and regional state level encouraged some degree of citizen participation in planning and input into adaptation. However, despite emerging networks for city-level coordination and capacity to adapt to flood risks among local residents, there were limitations in how higher-level government and institutions supported the lower levels in vertical and horizontal coordination. In particular, services and investments within poor and vulnerable settlements were lacking. This undermined the capability of municipal staff for local engagement and for diverse groups of residents to become really effective partners with the government in coproducing services required to enhance resilience. More so, it limited opportunities to bring local actions to scale-beyond the city boundaries and toward transitional adaptation and transformation.",0.05810744514659262,0.3901844884123296,0.10766114890668893,0.21281581241174308,0.1895260924069993,0.7496085309382102,0.3852662961636296

Policy Environment for the Tourism Sector's Adaptation to Climate Change in the South Pacific - The Case of Samoa,"Samoa and its neighbouring Pacific Island Countries are highly vulnerable to climate change risks because their population and infrastructure are mostly located on low-lying coastal areas.

Farmers' perceptions of climate change impacts on ecosystem services delivery of parklands in southern Mali,"Agroforestry parklands in the Sahel provide a number of ecosystem services that help farmers cope better with climate change effects and thus reducing their vulnerability. However, parklands are threatened due to the decline in densities of species that are sensitive to drought and that might compromise the delivery of the above mentioned ecosystem services to farmers. Therefore, data were collected by interviewing 400 smallholder farmers to elucidate farmers' perceptions of climate change in southern Mali and potential consequences on the delivery of ecosystem services from the parklands. Descriptive statistics and multinomial logit model were used to analyse the data collected and identify the indictors as well as the determinants of farmers' perception of climate change. The findings revealed increases in the frequency of strong wind, dust, drought, high temperatures and number of hot days as the main climate change-related indicators. Furthermore, an early cessation of the rainy season, frequent drought and wind were found to be the factors impeding a better delivery of the ecosystem services from the parklands. Early cessation of rains and frequent drought might affect the water availability which in turn affects the flowering and fruiting phases of the trees. The occurrence of strong wind causes the shedding of the flowers thus reducing the fruit production. Age, educational level, farm size and gender are key factors influencing farmer's perception of climate change. The strategies adopted by these farmers to cope with climate shocks include use of improved drought-tolerant crop varieties, diversification of crops, off-farm activities and seasonal migration. Based on these findings, we therefore suggest the development of conducive environment that can help create agricultural related off-farm income earning activities that could protect active households from the impacts of climate change and variability.",0.9760956145051737,0.14153146709180187,0.07311110694148688,0.579776996550122,0.025419681430577903,0.007087042505336318,0.015134502487090284
Is Land Fragmentation Facilitating or Obstructing Adoption of Climate Adaptation Measures in Ethiopia?,"Land fragmentation is high and increasing in the Gamo Highlands of southwest Ethiopia. We postulate that this substantial land fragmentation is obstructing the adoption of sustainable land management practices as climate adaptation measures. To explore this, a mixed method study was conducted with emphasis on a multivariate probit model. The results indicate that farmers adapt to climate change and variability they perceive. According to the probit model, there is no clear answer to the question whether land fragmentation facilitates or obstructs adoption of sustainable land management practices. Yet, a qualitative analysis found that farmers perceive land fragmentation as an obstacle to land improvement as adaptation strategy. Moreover, farmers invest more in land improvement on plots close to their homestead than in remote plots. However, the higher land fragmentation also promoted crop diversification, manure application and terracing. Although exogenous to farmers, we therefore suggest that land fragmentation can be deployed in climate change adaptation planning. This can be done through voluntary assembling of small neighboring plots in clusters of different microclimates to encourage investment in remote fields and to collectively optimize the benefits of fragmentation to adaptation.",0.8425208241706457,0.2360398654222702,0.12266716710820563,0.525488655001867,0.020508166115153516,0.038814585072511426,0.028837579780858907
Cocoa agroforestry is less resilient to sub-optimal and extreme climate than cocoa in full sun,"Cocoa agroforestry is perceived as potential adaptation strategy to sub-optimal or adverse environmental conditions such as drought. We tested this strategy over wet, dry and extremely dry periods comparing cocoa in full sun with agroforestry systems: shaded by (i) a leguminous tree species, Albizia ferruginea and (ii) Antiaris toxicaria, the most common shade tree species in the region. We monitored micro-climate, sap flux density, throughfall, and soil water content from November 2014 to March 2016 at the forest-savannah transition zone of Ghana with climate and drought events during the study period serving as proxy for projected future climatic conditions in marginal cocoa cultivation areas of West Africa. Combined transpiration of cocoa and shade trees was significantly higher than cocoa in full sun during wet and dry periods. During wet period, transpiration rate of cocoa plants shaded by A. ferruginea was significantly lower than cocoa under A. toxicaria and full sun. During the extreme drought of 2015/16, all cocoa plants under A. ferruginea died. Cocoa plants under A. toxicaria suffered 77% mortality and massive stress with significantly reduced sap flux density of 115 g cm(-2) day(-1), whereas cocoa in full sun maintained higher sap flux density of 170 g cm(-2) day(-1). Moreover, cocoa sap flux recovery after the extreme drought was significantly higher in full sun (163 g cm(-2) day(-1)) than under A. toxicaria (37 g cm(-2) day(-1)). Soil water content in full sun was higher than in shaded systems suggesting that cocoa mortality in the shaded systems was linked to strong competition for soil water. The present results have major implications for cocoa cultivation under climate change. Promoting shade cocoa agroforestry as drought resilient system especially under climate change needs to be carefully reconsidered as shade tree species such as the recommended leguminous A. ferruginea constitute major risk to cocoa functioning under extended severe drought.",0.8415717855492442,0.25927481324690144,0.12212553508530163,0.29809523813391625,0.025714821599958474,0.050287317593435535,0.08731993804650327
Urban and peri-urban agriculture and forestry: Transcending poverty alleviation to climate change mitigation and adaptation,"A range of published and grey literature over the last three decades has underlined the importance of urban and peri-urban agriculture and forestry (UPAF) in cities of developing regions. The focus in the published literature is on livelihoods, poverty reduction and ecosystems services at multiple city scales. Cities of developing regions, particularly in Africa, are searching for ways of addressing the unavoidable impacts of climate change and UPAF has demonstrated scalable adaptation and mitigation potential. However, evidence of UPAF's role in mitigating and adaptation to climate change is scattered in various reports and has not been synthesized for its potential role in developing urban adaptation strategies. Building on the earlier poverty reduction focus of UPAF research, this paper contributes to UPAF knowledge regarding mitigating and adapting to climate change in urban and peri-urban areas in East and West Africa. The paper reports a synthesis based on a systematic review of the available literature on these regions, and selected sources on other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The paper also examines the extent to which literature conveys any evidence for UPAF playing a role in mediating the effects of climate/environmental change. Limited empirical verification was undertaken in Kampala and Ibadan, but this does not form the basis for systematic generalization. The key emerging areas of adaptation and mitigation include enhanced food security, productive greening, ecosystem services and innovative policy for urban resilience and transformation.

A window of opportunity for climate-change adaptation: easing tree mortality by reducing forest basal area,"Increasing aridity as a result of climate change is expected to exacerbate tree mortality. Reducing forest basal area - the cross-sectional area of tree stems within a given ground area - can decrease tree competition, which may reduce drought-induced tree mortality. However, neither the magnitude of expected mortality increases, nor the potential effectiveness of basal area reduction, has been quantified in dryland forests such as those of the drought-prone Southwest US. We used thousands of repeatedly measured forest plots to show that unusually warm and dry conditions are related to high tree mortality rates and that mortality is positively related to basal area. Those relationships suggest that while increasing high temperature extremes forecasted by climate models may lead to elevated tree mortality during the 21st century, future tree mortality might be partly ameliorated by reducing stand basal area. This adaptive forest management strategy may provide a window of opportunity for forest managers and policy makers to guide forest transitions to species and/or genotypes more suited to future climates.",0.5,0.26695613705073246,0.21481197634420435,0.2295736445674267,0.041058366862402926,0.05125913454127722,0.06422167827365492
"Climate change in semi-arid Malawi: Perceptions, adaptation strategies and water governance","Climate change and variability are a threat to sustainable agricultural production in semi-arid areas of Malawi. Overdependence on subsistence rain-fed agriculture in these areas calls for the identification of sustainable adaptation strategies. A study was therefore conducted in Chikwawa, a semi-arid district in southern Malawi, to: (1) assess community's perception of a changing climate against empirical evidence, (2) determine their local adaptive measures, (3) evaluate the potential of irrigated agriculture as an adaptive measure in household food security and (4) challenges over access to available water resources. The study employed focus group discussions and key informant interviews to assess people's perceptions of climate change and variability and their desired interventions. To validate the people's perceptions, rainfall and temperature data for the period 1960-2010 were analysed. A participatory complete randomised experimental design in both rain-fed and dry season-irrigated conditions was conducted to assess a maize cropping system that would improve adaptation. The study established persistent declining yields from rain-fed production in part because of perennial rainfall failure. In response, the community has shifted its focus to irrigation as an adaptation strategy, which has in turn triggered water conflicts in the community over the control of the resource. Water legislation however fails to adequately provide for rules governing sharing of water resources between various stakeholders. This article therefore recommends development of an appropriate institutional framework that forms a strong basis for equitable distribution of water for irrigation in areas most vulnerable to extreme climate events - including droughts and floods.",0.8847383264851493,0.2425080600231194,0.07807604869066702,0.49098350992463446,0.036202851868154876,0.02742389799332763,0.44273053220075076
"Socio-Economic Determinants of Adoption of Rainwater Harvesting and Conservation Techniques in Semi-Arid Tharaka Sub-County, Kenya","This paper examines determinants of adoption of rainwater harvesting and conservation techniques in semi-arid Tharaka sub-county, Eastern Kenya. Given the erratic rainfall that characterises Tharaka, rainwater harvesting and conservation is critical for the improvement of agricultural production. The study was conducted in two agro-ecological zones, and 196 respondents were interviewed. The majority of the farmers were practising between 1-3 and 4-6 rainwater harvesting and conservation techniquesan indication of the awareness of the benefits. In situ technologies were more frequently practised than micro-catchment and macro-catchment technologies. There were institutional efforts supporting adoption of micro-catchment and macro-catchment techniques in the recent past. Correlation results showed that the number of techniques practised was influenced by the number of years spent in school, arable land size, labour availability and number of livelihood options. Soil quality is an unlikely determinant of rainwater harvesting because a majority of the farmers rated it as good and fair. Chi-squared results suggest that choice of rainwater techniques is primarily informed by a desire to harvest and conserve soil moisture than to improve soil quality. Although adoption of these technologies is encouraging, assessment of their efficiency in the context of physical attributes such as soil characteristics, slope and rainfall amount of the area would add value.

"Collecting rainwater, a sustainable solution to climate change?","The main problems faced by any city at present are: reduction of natural resources, environmental degradation, increased carbon dioxide, demographic and social changes associated with the urbanization and population growth phenomenon as well as increased frequency and size of floods urban.Stormwater collection is a strategy for adapting to climate change. This strategy has been applied by many civilizations in the history of mankind, pluvial water collection systems have met, for the first time, in areas with long droughts. At present, rainwater collection is gaining interest worldwide, not just to store water during droughts, but also to cope with extreme rainfall, and therefore have a significant impact on rainwater management. An important consequence of climate change is the change in the ratio between periods with extreme rainfall and periods of drought. The city infrastructure is not prepared for these changes, the consequences being accounted for in material damage and health risks to the population. In this paper we aim to highlight the main measures to adapt to climate change from the point of view of pluvial water resources management. © SGEM2018 All Rights Reserved.",0.412531350950878,0.3216606863687643,0.12499486568885672,0.2751762802992251,0.04636750709241798,0.17923348874481662,0.4061620397708804
"Coping with droughts and floods: A Case study of Kanyemba, Mbire District, Zimbabwe","Most of Southern Africa is affected by extreme weather events, droughts and floods being the most common. The frequency of floods and droughts in Southern Africa in general, of which the Zambezi River Basin is part of, has been linked to climate change. Droughts and floods impact on the natural environment, and directly and indirectly impact on livelihoods. In the Middle Zambezi River Basin, which is located between Kariba and Cahora Bassa dams, extreme weather events are exacerbated by human activities, in particular the operation of both the Kariba and the Cahora Bassa reservoirs. To understand better, whether, and in what ways extreme weather events impact on livelihoods, this study used both quantitative and qualitative research methods to analyse rainfall variability and coping strategies used by households in the river basin. Data collection was done using semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and structured questionnaires which were administered to 144 households. An analysis of rainfall variability and Cahora Bassa water level over 23 years was carried out. The study found that perceptions of households were that average rainfall has decreased over the years, and dry-spells have become more frequent. Furthermore, households perceived flood events to have increased over the last two decades. However, the analysis of rainfall variability revealed that the average rainfall received between 1988 and 2011 had not changed but the frequency of dry-spells and floods had increased. The occurrence of floods in the study area was found to be linked to heavy local rain and backflow from Cahora Bassa dam. The study found that households adopted a number of strategies to cope with droughts and floods, such as vegetable farming and crop production in the floodplain, taking on local jobs that brought in wages, planting late and livestock disposals. Some households also resorted to out-migration on a daily basis to Zambia or Mozambique. The study concluded that coping mechanisms were found to be inflexible and poorly suited to adapt to floods and droughts. The study recommends the implementation of adaptation measures such as the cultivation of drought-resistant crop varieties, irrigation and off-farm employment opportunities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial modelling of natural disaster risk reduction policies with Markov decision processes,"The 2010/2011 floods in Queensland, Australia inflicted significant damages to government's critical infrastructures, private properties and businesses reaching an estimated amount of AU$16 billion. Mitigating the devastating effects of floods to the community and critical infrastructures entails competing financial requirements at the different levels of government. Hence, the main objective of this study was to examine the financial optimality of disaster risk reduction measures by integrating Markov decision processes (MOP for short) with geographic information system (GIS). Conducted in the core suburbs of Brisbane City, we organised the MDP variables using the following: 1) flood risk levels as the states of the urban system; 2) Queensland's disaster risk reduction measures as the action variables; 3) percentage of government expenditures by disaster risk reduction category as the state transition probabilities; 4) total lost earnings to businesses affected by the flood events as the reward variables; and 5) the weighted average riskless rate of return, the weighted average rate of return, and rate of return for a riskier asset as discounting factors. We analysed 36 MDP scenarios at four-level iteration and then calculated the expectimax values to find the optimal policy. The results from the analyses revealed that the Commonwealth government optimised the use of its natural disaster risk reduction expenditures to recovery while the State government focused on mitigation. When both government expenditures combined, the mitigation measure was identified as the optimum natural disaster risk reduction policy. The methodology presented in this study allowed a spatial representation and computationally feasible integration of complex flood disaster risk model with government expenditures and business earnings. The insights from this integrated approach emphasise the viability of finding optimum expenditures, and re-examine if necessary, in implementing natural disaster risk reduction policies and climate adaptation strategies.

An Economic Comparison of Adaptation Strategies Towards a Drought-induced Risk of Forest Decline,"Drought is a source of stress that affects forest growth, resulting in financial losses for forest owners and amenity losses for society. Due to climate change, such natural events will be more frequent and intense in the future. In this context, the objective of this paper is to compare, from an economic perspective, different forest adaptation strategies towards a drought-induced risk of decline. For that purpose, we focused on a case study of a beech forest in Burgundy (France) and we studied several adaptation options: density reduction, reduction of the rotation length, and substitution with Douglas-fir. We also considered two levels of drought risk (intermediate and low soil water capacity) and two climate scenarios from the IPCC (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). We combined a process-based forest-growth simulator (CASTANEA) with a traditional forest economics approach. The results showed that adaptation provided the best economic return in most of the scenarios considered. Combining strategies appears as a relevant way to adapt forests in view of a drought-induced risk of forest decline. We also demonstrated the importance of considering two disciplinary fields. Beneficial scenarios in an ecological perspective were not necessarily beneficial in an economic one and vice versa.",0.5964338006068477,0.2969536614301325,0.366849476246175,0.21395746994816842,0.031720481245932845,0.06163739218090971,0.14690922978013332
Tariff structures and incentives for water demand management,"Urban water managers need to adopt water demand management (WDM) as one of the ways to provide for the needs and demands of escalating urban populations, amidst the negative impacts of increased pollution loads and climate change on finite water resources. This paper reviews how urban water tariff structures could be designed to promote water conservation in households while also ensuring revenue sufficiency for the service providers and affordability for low-income households. As an example, the paper describes the case of Zaragoza (Spain), a city where implementation of a water-conserving tariff and providing economic incentives largely contributed to a 27% reduction in overall water consumption between 1996 and 2008, although the population of the city increased by 12%. Similar principles were adapted to model a water-saving, socially equitable tariff for the city of Kampala (Uganda). The proposed tariff for Kampala can save over 2.5 million m3 of water and generate an extra US$ 0.68 million of revenue per year, which could be used to extend water services to currently unserved households in low-income settlements. If implemented, the tariff could enhance economic efficiency, revenue sufficiency, social equity and service coverage.",0.22909572091060248,0.25417813986419296,0.13749790441856144,0.24187242705387638,0.040584002939526034,0.5897284437603127,0.7908908563426094
"Flood-risk mapping for strategic planning, incident management and the future","Flood-risk mapping has become inextricably linked with the management of flood risk areas by all risk management authorities. From European Union directives to more local strategic and community-based planning approaches, maps and the way in which they represent future flood risk, are fundamental. The evolution of flood-risk mapping and the innovative approaches taken by the Environment Agency have historically been governed by the lessons learnt from past flood events. In a changing economic climate, the need to further adapt these methods and provide new interactive ways of promoting flood risk, and engaging with those individuals at risk, is vital to the future management of flood risk across the United Kingdom.",0.08085630419368631,0.48336808082254107,0.11235376863032637,0.13253044434994454,0.18743029402811576,0.7304414328643503,0.8948217204820993
Perceptions and responses to urban flood risk: Implications for climate governance in the South,"In recent years, floods caused by heavy rain have caused major disasters in urban centres around the world. A lack of disaster preparedness in the global South has resulted in much damage in urban environments. These damages will have long-term repercussions for governance, communities and the natural environment. Heavy rainfall events are projected to become more intense and frequent due to climate change, and many recently affected areas may face more heavy rainfall and flooding in the future. Urban governance underpins the ability to manage disasters, through all phases of preparation, response and recovery. This paper focuses on flood risk in the global South, and how risk perceptions influence how local government and residents manage disasters. Findings from a case study in Ekurhuleni, South Africa indicate that local residents' risk perceptions are influenced by historical relationships of distrust with local government. Local government officials, on the other hand, indicate the range of challenges, such as limited capacity for implementing policy, that limit the effectiveness of local government's ability to manage flood related risks. In assessing how adaptive capacity can be developed in cities in the global South, the potential for local government and community capacity to work in a complementary manner is explored.

Ecosystem services from woody vegetation on agricultural lands in Sudano-Sahelian West Africa,"Investment in woody vegetation to counter land degradation and improve livelihoods is increasing, primarily revitalized by efforts to enhance carbon sequestration and climate change adaptation. Sudano-Sahelian West Africa is in focus for several interventions to increase woody vegetation for improved livelihoods. However, the knowledge on how woody vegetation maintains landscape productivity and contributes to livelihoods is widely scattered across different scientific fields. Here we review different bodies of literature including a total of 30 species of woody vegetation. We use ecosystem services as a lens to integrate knowledge about how woody vegetation affect ecosystem processes and contribute to livelihoods. We find that the majority of the species generate multiple provisioning ecosystem services. Medicinal uses, contribution to fodder for livestock and importance for human nutrition are reported for almost all species. Regulating ecosystem services are studied for a more narrow set of species. There are mainly positive or no effects on soil nutrients, soil carbon and soil water content. The overall effect of woody vegetation on crop yields is mediated through multiple processes and shows both positive and negative effects. The majority of studies are focused on effects of individual elements of woody vegetation, with very limited landscape scale analyses. Differences between beneficiaries of ecosystem services are only discussed in a few studies, and only in relation provisioning services. Therefore, future studies need to address landscape scale effects and how the benefits of ecosystem services are distributed among beneficiaries, to provide knowledge that is even more relevant for interventions that aim to enhance climate mitigation and adaptation, ecosystem restoration, as well as poverty alleviation.

Drivers for coping with flood hazards: Beyond the analysis of single cases,"Flood risks continue to pose serious threats to developing countries with dire ramifications for livelihoods. Yet, contemporary research on determinants for coping with flood hazards is driven mostly by individual cases with less effort to systematically identify coping strategies across multiple floods. This research analyses potential determinants of coping strategies to flooding across multiple floods using two case studies in Cameroon. Via empirical research and qualitative or descriptive statistical analysis, the research investigated how human, social, and economic or financial variables influence household coping decisions across the two flood sites. Results suggest a great influence of social and human capital on household decisions to adopt specific coping strategies and that over 80% of flood victims in both study sites applied post-flood informal coping strategies. Analysis also shows significant inconsistencies with human capital variables, which reveal that coping determinants can be quite different even for floods occurring in the same agroecological zone. The findings also reveal that economic and financial capital has little influence on flood victims' coping decisions, contrary to popular contentions in the literature. The results of this study have implications for research and policy implementation on flood-induced coping strategies in developing countries.",0.22328689919634379,0.3522746762998463,0.13039558801000983,0.5248442567974351,0.09715314039469565,0.34701006422341124,0.6594105338092573

"Differences in Climate Change Effects and Adaptation Strategies between Male and Female Livestock Entrepreneurs in Nsukka Agricultural Zone of Enugu State, Nigeria","The study examined differences in climate change effects and adaptation strategies between male and female livestock entrepreneurs in Nsukka Agricultural Zone of Enugu State, Nigeria. It was conducted using 80 randomly selected livestock entrepreneurs. Data were collected using interview schedule. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data. Fifty percent of the respondents were female. Males sourced more climate-related livestock information than females; recording 29.6% difference in feed formulation information; which is the most differed. Females were more affected by climate change than males, with the difference more on disruption of animal heat period due to high temperature (male (X) over bar = 2.80; female (X) over bar = 3.50; difference in mean{dm} = -0.70). Male entrepreneurs differed from females in the adaptation strategies used in combating climate change and also on their view on effectiveness of adaptation strategies. Females were more constrained than male in adapting to climate change; with the variance more on lack of information facilities (male (X) over bar = 2.28; female (X) over bar = 2.60; dm = -0.32). Males and females differed in their effects and adaptation strategies to climate change. Hence, government and extension should step in to booster productivity by addressing climate-related bottle neck faced by entrepreneurs in livestock production, especially those faced by female.",0.9073617435455772,0.23967508201193774,0.10552175425669982,0.5318032752808806,0.0363862570288286,0.033436766528211335,0.04858132695556456
"Vulnerability analysis of building structures to floods The case of flooding informal settlements in Dar es salaam, Tanzania","Purpose There is evidence of increasing urban floods being aftermath of climate change. The purpose of this paper is to present findings-related analysis of vulnerability of building structures in informal settlements to floods and associated coping strategies. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a case study strategy, supported by field surveys and laboratory experiments. The informal settlement taken as case study is Sunna sub-ward. Field surveys involved interviews, questionnaires and observations and tests were conducted to determine the strength of walls, blocks and mortar. Findings The findings reveal that vulnerability of building structures to floods are due to poor quality of materials used in construction of houses which are influenced by income levels, location (lower areas of Sunna sub-ward) and inadequate storm water drainage system. Moreover, socio-economic vulnerabilities do exist in the settlements and are related to lack of peace of mind, outbreak of disease and expenses related to repairing of flood affected houses. Coping strategies used in the sub-ward for built structures are building barrier walls at the front door of the house and use multiple strategies which are supported by reactive and recovery strategies. Research limitations/implications - The findings of this study were mostly affected by limited knowledge of respondents on construction materials and processes. Practical implications - Findings of the paper provide an insight on the effects of climate change on building structures in informal settlements and coping strategies in place to protect buildings. The outputs can be used for any other informal settlement in Dar es Salaam the only limitation is the terrain. Originality/value The paper recommends use of quality building materials and technicians/artisans, improvement of surface water drainage and training of residents on the effects of climate change and variability. In addition, promising coping strategies should be adopted while those under-performing should be discouraged as they increase the cost burden among the urban poor.",0.30034793947669797,0.34393647989799175,0.06983415550510808,0.4370931996222219,0.06056432514629993,0.30001229453823625,0.28356108618861686
"Determinants of climate change adaptation strategies used by fish farmers in Epe Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria","BACKGROUND Undesirable impacts of climate change have been a common occurrence that has made fish farmers in developing countries adopt some climate-change adaptation strategies. However, little is known about determinants of climate-change adaptation strategies used by these fish farmers. This study, therefore, articulates novelties on adaptation to climate change, as well ascertains determinants of adaptation strategies used by fish farmers in Epe, Lagos State, Nigeria. RESULTS Climate change adaptation strategies mostly used by fish farmers include frequent seeking for early warning information about climate change (76.7%) and avoidance of areas susceptible to flooding (60.0%). Climate-change adaptation strategies used by fish farmers were significantly influenced by access to early warning information (beta = 7.21), knowledge of farmers about climate change adaptation strategies (beta = 8.86), access to capital (beta = 28.25), and participation in workshop and conferences (beta = 37.19) but were reduced by number of fish stocking (beta = -2.06). CONCLUSION The adaptation strategies used by fish farmers were autonomous and mostly determined by the access to credit facilities and information. Development policy should focus on carbon capture and storage technology in order to reduce adverse impacts of climate change, as well as making early warning information on climate change available to fish farmers. These will enhance adaptation to climate change.

Climate variability and livelihood diversification in northern Ethiopia: a case study of Lasta and Beyeda districts,"This article examines smallholders' perceptions of climate variability in two districts in northern Ethiopia, and the diversification options pursued within and outside agriculture. Meteorological records corroborate smallholders' belief that temperatures are increasing but do not support assertions that rainfall is decreasing. Farm-level adaptation mainly involves soil and water conservation measures learnt from state-led schemes as well as planting a broader crop mix. Diversification outside agriculture is mainly wage labour: international and national migration, construction work in local towns, participation in public works and piecework on nearby farms. The article concludes by arguing that policymakers could do more to support non-farm diversification strategies by recognising the importance of rural-urban connections in fostering adaptation.",0.7977261981993413,0.24827882090565992,0.09685267211988859,0.5644926049785998,0.05357856297131651,0.06913088810435601,0.14003479991860623
Adapting household water use in rural Zimbabwe,"The study investigated how rural communities in semi-arid areas (1) adapt household water management to effects of climate variability and (2) how such adaptation influences household water usage and its quality. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 180 households between July and December 2014 to obtain demographic data on water supply and use. Microbiological quality of source and stored drinking water was determined using a Potatest field kit. In times of water scarcity, households exploited distant (>1 km) sources and stored large quantities (>60 L) of water up to >4 days. Water was re-contaminated by faecal coliforms during storage. Distance to a water source, sharing a source, type of lifting device, type of source and collector of water significantly influenced water supply across villages (p < 0.05). Villagers were more likely to draw less water at greater distances. Point-of-use water treatment and improved hygiene behaviour are recommended. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.8148098038488943,0.21878221114076565,0.14462046773744133,0.278547355857133,0.023108780210369433,0.06080021851790749,0.7729172824196382
Coping with rainfall variability in northern Tanzania,"This paper explores a potential relationship between rainfall data and household self-reported harvest shocks and local (spatial) variability of harvest shocks and coping strategies based on a survey of 2700 rural households in the Kagera region of northern Tanzania. In addition, correlations of rainfall amounts across the districts in the region are estimated in order to assess the variations in rainfall patterns across the districts. The results show that rainfall patterns in the region are very location-specific, there are few correlations between rainfall events, and that the distribution of household reported harvest shocks differs significantly between districts and correspond to the observed variability in local climate patterns. Coping strategies are focused on spreading risks and include reduced consumption, casual employment, new crops, external support and the selling of assets. There are no large differences in applied coping strategies across the region, but district-level data demonstrate how local strategies differ between localities within the districts. The results emphasize that in order to target rural policies and make them efficient, it is important to take into account the local conditions that rural households face when experiencing climate-related shocks. Finally, shocks reported by households appear to correspond well with observed variability in rainfall patterns. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Drought tolerant maize for farmer adaptation to drought in sub-Saharan Africa: Determinants of adoption in eastern and southern Africa,"In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), ""maize is life,"" due to its importance to food security and economic wellbeing. Around 40 % of Africa's maize-growing area faces occasional drought stress, resulting in yield losses of 10-25 %. Around 25 % of the maize crop suffers frequent drought, with losses of up to half the harvest. To reduce vulnerability and improve food security, the Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa (DTMA) project has made releases of 160 drought tolerant (DT) maize varieties between 2007 and 2013. These have been tested in experimental and farmers' fields, and disseminated to farmers in 13 African countries through national agricultural research systems and private seed companies. Yields of the new varieties are superior to those of currently available commercial maize varieties under both stress and optimum growing conditions. Although the benefits of DT maize for African farmers have been repeatedly predicted, realization of those benefits depends on farmer uptake, which has received limited empirical study. We use new plot-level data from surveys of 3,700 farm households in six countries (Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) to measure DT maize adoption rates and their determinants. The data reveal considerable inter-country variation in farmer uptake of DT maize, from 9 % of maize plots in Zimbabwe to 61 % in Malawi. The major barriers to adoption include unavailability of improved seed, inadequate information, lack of resources, high seed price, and perceived attributes of different varieties. Based on the results, we recommend that seed companies and agro-dealers ensure adequate supply of DT maize seed in local markets and sell seed in affordable micro-packs (1 or 2 kg). Furthermore, the DTMA project and partners should ramp up promotional efforts to ensure widespread awareness and understanding of the benefits of the new DT maize varieties.",0.9433995922703208,0.1782110355905313,0.08613651200993729,0.4508793958295054,0.022946504124512143,0.02315869404706966,0.016490505105460556
Local-level climate change adaptation decision-making and livelihoods in semi-arid areas in Zimbabwe,"There is now overwhelming evidence of climate change and variability impacts in Africa, among them a reduction in agricultural production. This is a cause for concern given that 70 % of the continent's population derives its livelihoods directly from rain-fed agriculture. There is need for adaptation strategies at all levels from the national to the local level to mitigate these adverse impacts from climate change. It is important to take advantage of and strengthen already existing household and community strategies. This study used both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to explore the role that livelihood dynamics play in local-level decision-making for adaptation to everyday vulnerability. Risk is considered to extend beyond climate to non-climatic stressors, and the notion of climate change as the major shock among many others is downgraded to one that is secondary to other shocks that even pose more danger to household and community livelihoods. The natural capital remains the basis upon which all the other capitals depend as drivers of choice for adaptation practices. A reorientation of capitals and associated activities is inevitable to deal with everyday vulnerability given that livelihood capitals play a key role in adaptation. Choice of household response strategies to shocks is not entirely intrinsic, but rather integral to a context where other players such as the extension operate to influence adaptation choices. This then highlights the need for embeddedness and context in understanding adaptation and livelihood changes.",0.6727688388140696,0.37499538457331194,0.1040898740932992,0.5093566211173972,0.1032748522948732,0.04482624087293284,0.07091797178639038
"Assessing municipal-level governance responses to climate change in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","The 2011 Durban Adaptation Charter for Local Governments calls on local governments, worldwide, to institutionalise climate response, with the aim of minimising the impacts of climate change on local livelihoods and vulnerable communities. This paper, through the use of case studies, in-depth interviews and document review, assesses how three non-metropolitan municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal, a district municipality, and two local municipalities under its jurisdiction, are responding to this call. The results suggest that while the municipalities have adopted measures to institutionalise climate responses, the responses are relatively new and implementation is slow, complex and fraught with limitations and competing demands. Furthermore, there appears to be a lack of co-ordination of responses between the two levels of government, which has the potential to lead to duplication. Given the multi-scalar nature of climate change, emphasis on co-ordination and the inclusion of all municipal departments in the development and implementation of responses is necessary.",0.27385568402210786,0.3760388863501566,0.12298218296918678,0.2520321579157379,0.07800375111471361,0.2498486469954614,0.14667312863752474
Awareness of climate change and implications for attaining the millennium development goals (MDGS) in niger delta region of nigeria,"The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is at the centre of both the economic wealth and climate change in the context of pressing national economic issues. It produces the nation's major foreign exchange earnercrude oil, has abundant fishery and marine resources- all of which are threatened by vagaries in climatic factors. The study was conducted to evaluate awareness of climate change and implications for attaining the MDGs in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The study made use of a multi-stage sampling technique to select three hundred and sixty respondents across three Niger Delta States (Delta, Edo, Ondo). Data for the study were collected with the aid of well-structured questionnaires assisted with interview schedules administered on the respondents. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics. The analysis of awareness of climate change indicated that level of awareness is low but improving. It was found, however, that the mass media has played the most significant roles in climate change awareness in the study area. The results also indicated that the respondents had been practicing some indigenous and emerging adaptive strategies to climate change for many years. This study concluded that more awareness about climate change in the Niger Delta region have implications for attaining the MDGs.",0.7213453503174876,0.32876266022389283,0.10500414039105113,0.43174131244265485,0.0763590285315275,0.0435912133553841,0.041468039719219994
Provisioning ecosystem services-sharing as a coping and adaptation strategy among rural communities in Ghana's semi-arid ecosystem,"As complex challenges linked to changing socio-economic, environmental, political, and cultural conditions continually hamper the delivery of ecosystem services to natural resource dependent communities, local level adaptation needs attention. This paper presents the findings of an empirical survey in rural semi-arid Ghana investigating how households are employing communal sharing as a strategy to enhance access and management of nine provisioning ecosystem services (provisioning ES) namely crops and vegetables, livestock and poultry, bushmeat, freshwater, wildplants, fodder and forage, traditional medicine, fuelwood, and building materials. The results indicate that the variations in the sharing patterns of the nine provisioning ES can be linked to a mix of closely-linked socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors. Traditional medicine is the most commonly shared, whilst building materials are the least commonly shared. Sharing intensifies during the long dry season for majority of the provisioning ES. Logistic regression modeling indicates annual household income to be the most significant socio-demographic variable influencing participation in sharing. A greater proportion of interviewed household heads (64%) perceive sharing to be on the decline. These findings provide important baseline data for further quantitative and qualitative research exploring sharing's potential contribution to rural households' livelihoods sustenance and ecosystem sustainability under changing conditions.

Analysis of Climate Change Adaptation Measures Used by Rural Dwellers in the Southeast and Southsouth Zone of Nigeria,"The renewed quest for specific climate change adaptation measures that will address the needs of rural dwellers in their specified location prompted this study. This study analysed climate change adaptation measures used by rural dwellers in southeast and Southsouth Nigeria. Structured questionnaire, interview schedule, focused group discussion and direct observation were used to collect data from 320 respondents selected using a multi-stage sampling method. Data obtained were analysed using descriptive, multivariate and inferential statistics namely mean, percentages, frequency count, Varimax rotated factor analysis, analysis of variance and Turkey HSD post hoc multiple comparison test. The major occupation of the rural dwellers in the study area was farming (70.9 %) and 95 % have a farm size of less than 1 ha of land. The majority (83.7 %) had at least 10 years farming experience and earned an average monthly income of less than fifty thousand naira (77.2 %). The majority (60.3 %) maintained a household size of between 6 and 10 persons. Cassava and yam were the major crops cultivated while poultry, goat and fish were the major animals reared. The results further showed that 97 % of the respondents were already aware of the change in climate mainly through personal experience (78 %). Variation in rainfall patterns (46.9 %) was found to be the most prominent climate change variable in the study area. The Varimax rotated factor analysis identified eight major climate change adaptation measures used by farmers in the study area namely improved livestock management practices and mixed farming, soil fertility improvement measures and use of information from Agricultural Extension agent, use of improved crop species and diversification, change in planting/harvesting dates, application of agricultural chemicals, irrigation facilities and insurance, increase farm size and reliance on family labour, use of cover crops and avoidance of sale of remaining seedling after planting. The result of the ANOVA revealed that significant differences were found to exist in the adaptation measures use amongst the rural dwellers in the study area. Based on the findings of this study, it was recommended that there is a need for expansion in the role of agricultural extension agents in the nation. In addition, more studies addressing the differences in climate change adaptation measures are encouraged as this will equip the extension agencies and other stakeholders in climate change issues to develop relevant location-specific climate change adaptation measures that will effectively address the needs of farmers.",0.9641768421203727,0.1402157615362375,0.09491676412125703,0.4594897596291375,0.02806676665093383,0.02923064787633354,0.024203791691280462
"Migration, Social Demands and Environmental Change amongst the Frafra of Northern Ghana and the Biali in Northern Benin","The impacts of environmental change and degradation on human populations, including the possibility of sharp increases in the number of people considered ""environmental migrants"" have gained considerable attention. Migrating communities may try to distribute their members along particular lines of kinship, gender, marriage and/or services linked to land exploitation and agriculture. This paper explores archives and narratives of African migrants in northwestern Benin and northeastern Ghana. These regions have been marked by severe ecological change and resource deterioration over the years, as well as changes in marital patterns, family relations and customary practices. In the case of Benin, the paper looks at different ethnic groups that migrated from neighboring countries to the study region. It then focuses on the Biali, who undertake marriage journeys after practicing rituals, which are often related to agricultural activities. The Frafra (Ghana), who, in their bid to out-migrate as a livelihood/coping strategy in the advent of environmental deterioration and rainfall variability, are confronted with high bride prices, changing family relations and customary practices. The paper concludes by highlighting socio-cultural changes that ensue in the face of outmigration among different ethnic groups, especially the Biali and Frafra, and the relationship between non-environmental and environmental factors, and mobility strategies.",0.5593028781475864,0.35288517063617286,0.08861761476715123,0.6189077179362004,0.09372419175799687,0.035769854167868646,0.07700338239635006
"Determinants of smallholder cocoa farmers' adaptation to climate change in Ile-oluji/Okeigbo Local Government Area of Ondo State, Nigeria","Cocoa production is highly sensitive to changes in climate which are recently affecting cocoa yield in Nigeria. Adaptation is the best option to reduce these negative impacts and farmers' ability to perceive climate change is a key precondition for their choice to adapt. This study adopted a multi-stage random sampling and data were collected using structured questionnaires. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression. Results show that 35.8% of respondents observed extremely high temperature, 24.2% noticed extremely low temperature and 85.2% of the farmers noticed too much rainfall. Re-spray of cocoa and regular cocoa spraying were mostly used to cope with climate change (50.53%).

"Managing climate risks using seasonal climate forecast information in Vhembe district in Limpopo province, South Africa","The majority of small - scale farmers in the Vhembe district have been experiencing extreme climatic risk, high climate variability and change for a very long time. The majority of these small -scale farmers are vulnerable to all types of climate risk due to their low adaptive capacity, lack of access to technology as a result of level of education, lack of financial resources and also among other things low level of resilience and high level of poverty amongst these farmers. However, the majority of these small - scale farmers in the Vhembe district use different adaptive strategies as a way of preserving assets for future livelihoods including: (a) Drought resistant varieties, (b) Crop diversification, (c) Plant crops that require less water, (d) Some of these small - scale farmers use local climate indicators to monitor climate risk, (e) Adjust fertilizer input, (f) Use rainwater harvesting techniques. Different institutions in the country including the South African Weather Services, and the Agricultural Research Council, and the Limpopo Provincial Department of Agriculture, issue and disseminate the seasonal forecasts information to different districts including the Vhembe.

A CASE STUDY INTO THE PREPAREDNESS OF WHITE-WATER TOURISM TO SEVERE CLIMATIC EVENTS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA,"Extreme weather events pose a significant threat to outdoor tourism globally, as a result of their rapid onset and challenges in forecasting. These threats are particularly concerning for countries of the global South, due to their reliance on tourism and their relatively low adaptive capacity. White-water sports are especially vulnerable to climate variability as they are reliant on predictable river patterns. This article is an exploratory investigation into the experiences and perceptions of white-water tourism operators using the case study of South Africa and Namibia regarding the threats of extreme weather and climate change. It was found that extreme and unpredictable weather patterns are significantly impacting operators in this region. Many operators are thus acutely aware of the impacts of extreme weather and climate change, and have begun to implement adaptation measures. The current impacts of extreme weather associated with climatic changes and awareness within the white-water tourism sector provide a contribution to future discussions of tourism and climate change.",0.3002353827943762,0.40577650811495236,0.08767871301740696,0.23873370519542014,0.0679425014660827,0.07078118596095469,0.12894604728776474
Local Communities Vulnerability to Climate Change and Adaptation Strategies in Bukavu in DR Congo,"The analysis of vulnerabilities can help answer where and how society can best invest in vulnerability reduction. This study aimed at exploring vulnerability and adaptation strategies to climate change of local communities in Bukavu in DR Congo. Participatory action research was used in six villages from three collectivities around the Kahuzi Biega Park. Results showed that (a) perception of climate change depends on what people can see and feel about climate, (b) climate-related risks exacerbated existing problems and created new combinations of risks such as loss of livelihoods and deepening poverty cycle associated, (c) a range of adaptation measures was used or envisaged, and (d) implementation of those measures was hampered by a range of barriers.

Social and private profitability of tree-based adaptation options to climate change in a dryland area of Tunisia,"Climate change exacerbates the effects of water scarcity on livelihoods. Governments can intervene by structuring incentives for agricultural adaptations so that farmers can choose the ones that create more benefits for the society as a whole. This requires consideration of a range of different benefits to different groups within the social cost-benefit analysis (CBA). We assess the social and private profitability of two alternative tree-based adaptation techniques that have received state support in the traditional barley cropping/rangeland systems in Central Tunisia: olive tree plantation, and intercropping with cactus. The results showed that society does not benefit from offering incentives for olive production. The production of irrigated olive trees without incentives is profitable for farmers and for society, while rainfed plantation is not profitable at all. However, it is possible for farmers to increase their incomes without increasing agricultural water use if they are encouraged to adopt intercropping with cactus to supplement livestock food and watering. The findings highlight scope for policies to balance between returns both for society, and for farmers, as revealed through the application of quantitative social CBA.",0.8728375214206648,0.23666035857662857,0.10651922585266824,0.38473311091442935,0.04546923680764747,0.06071047837692185,0.07915731710865628
The status of climate change adaptation in Africa and Asia,"Adaptation is a key component of climate policy, yet we have limited and fragmented understanding of if and how adaptation is currently taking place. In this paper, we document and characterize the current status of adaptation in 47 vulnerable 'hotspot' nations in Asia and Africa, based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature, as well as policy documents, to extract evidence of adaptation initiatives. In total, 100 peer-reviewed articles, 161 grey literature documents, and 27 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change National Communications were reviewed, constituting 760 adaptation initiatives. Results indicate a significant increase in reported adaptations since 2006. Adaptations are primarily being reported from African and low-income countries, particularly those nations receiving adaptation funds, involve a combination of groundwork and more concrete adaptations to reduce vulnerability, and are primarily being driven by national governments, NGOs, and international institutions, with minimal involvement of lower levels of government or collaboration across nations. Gaps in our knowledge of adaptation policy and practice are particularly notable in North Africa and Central Asia, and there is limited evidence of adaptation initiatives being targeted at vulnerable populations including socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, children, indigenous peoples, and the elderly.",0.2542517527510489,0.3951751435072683,0.18761259669140473,0.38892412871150867,0.1880550141488377,0.13308944794555028,0.051444253490847996
Citrus and Tomatoes Response to Climate Change: Survey of Farmers’ Perception and Adaptation Strategies in Northern Nigeria,"Climate Change is a major challenge to agricultural development in Africa, Nigeria in particular and the world at large. Agriculture, as one of the most weather-dependent of all human activities, is highly vulnerable to climate change. The study was carried out to examine farmers’ perception and adaptation strategies to citrus and tomatoes response to climate change in Northern Nigeria. Multi-stage sampling procedure was used to select the study area. Purposely, North central and North-eastern zones were selected due to distinct comparative advantage in horticultural crop production. Benue (Central zone) and Gombe (North-east) agricultural zones were selected using random sampling technique, while Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) zones that are known for mass production of selected horticultural crops within the state were purposively selected. However, 271 farmers were proportionately sampled. Secondary (weather data) as well as primary sources were used for data collection. Primary sources of data used include structured questionnaire and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) which were subjected to both descriptive and inferential statistics. Result of analysis shows that majority of the respondents were between the ages of 35 and 45 years of age, married (89.7 %), and had formal education (84.5 %). Fifty-seven percent (57 %) were in high adaptation category, while 52.0 % were favorably disposed to the effect of climate change on production. Binomial logit regression shows that soil fertility, farmers’ financial capacity and access to inputs to a large extent determine their choice of adaptation strategy. However, the inferential statistics result shows a significant difference in the adaptation strategies (p = 0.000, t = −24.106) and farmers’ perception of citrus and tomatoes response to climate change (p = 0.004, t = −182.269). Intervention by relevant government and nongovernmental agencies toward adaptation strategies to mitigate the effect to this response will ultimately promote food security in Nigeria. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",0.9461881460878039,0.17947226188146126,0.06290802047324089,0.5912556817883745,0.03339372365359593,0.019975884409269732,0.009986875722072906
Comparison of community-based adaptation strategies for droughts and floods in Kenya and the Central African Republic,"This paper discusses community-based adaptation strategies for droughts and floods in small watersheds in Kenya and the Central African Republic. Survey data on adaptation strategies and annual rainfall data in the watersheds were used to assess the occurrence of floods and droughts, and their impacts. In both areas, the main adaptation strategy for floods is temporary relocation. For droughts, changing livelihood activities was the main adaptation strategy, while relief-seeking applied to both droughts and floods.

"Lake drying and livelihood dynamics in Lake Chad: Unravelling the mechanisms, contexts and responses","This article examines lake drying and livelihood dynamics in the context of multiple stressors through a case study of the ""Small Lake Chad"" in the Republic of Chad. Livelihoods research in regions experiencing persistent lake water fluctuations has largely focused on the well-being and security of lakeshore dwellers. Little is known about the mechanisms through which lake drying shapes livelihood drawbacks and opportunities, and whether locally evolved responses are enhancing livelihoods. Here we address these gaps using empirical, mixed-methods field research couched within the framework of livelihoods and human well-being contexts. The analysis demonstrates that limited opportunities outside agriculture, the influx of mixed ethnic migrants and the increasing spate of violence all enhance livelihood challenges. Livelihood opportunities centre on the renewal effects of seasonal flood pulses on lake waters and the learning opportunities triggered by past droughts. Although drying has spurred new adaptive behaviours predicated on seasonality, traditional predictive factors and the availability of assets, responses have remained largely reactive. The article points to where lake drying fits amongst changes in the wider socio-economic landscape in which people live, and suggests that awareness of the particularities of the mechanisms that connect lake drying to livelihoods can offer insights into the ways local people might be assisted by governments and development actors.",0.5128060380364922,0.40338273333400076,0.17888124204091355,0.5173140300098226,0.0992229990823452,0.058784097848064154,0.10576508988924843
Smallholder responses to climate anomalies in rural Uganda,"Recent research suggests that sub-Saharan Africa will be among the regions most affected by the negative social and biophysical ramifications of climate change. Smallholders are expected to respond to rising temperatures and precipitation anomalies through on-farm management strategies and diversification into off-farm activities. However, few studies have empirically examined the relationship between climate anomalies and rural livelihoods. Our research explores the impact of climate anomalies on farmers' on and off-farm livelihood strategies, considering both annual and decadal climate exposures, the relationship between on and off-farm livelihoods, and the implications of these livelihood strategies for agricultural productivity. To examine these issues, we link gridded climate data to survey data collected in 120 communities from 850 Ugandan households and 2000 agricultural plots in 2003 and 2013. We find that smallholder livelihoods are responsive to climate exposure over both short and long time scales. Droughts decrease agricultural productivity in the short term and reduce individual livelihood diversification in the long term. Smallholders cope with higher temperatures in the short term, but in the long run, farmers struggle to adapt to above-average temperatures, which lower agricultural productivity and reduce opportunities for diversification. On and off-farm livelihood strategies also appear to operate in parallel, rather than by substituting for one another. These observations suggest that new strategies will be necessary if rural smallholders are to successfully adapt to climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"Perception and responses of traders to climate change in downtown, Accra, Ghana","Purpose - What people understand by climate change can differ depending on whether and how the change affects their livelihoods. It is largely documented that farmers who depend on rainfall to cultivate crops understand climate change as a change in climatic elements, especially rainfall which negatively affects crop production. However, studies on how people whose livelihoods do not directly depend on climate change understand it, whether and how the changes affect their livelihoods and whether and how they are coping to the change are limited in the literature. This paper aims to therefore determine perspective of traders of climate change and how they cope. Design/methodology/approach - The data collection took place in Accra, which is the capital city of Ghana. Thousand traders who sold unprocessed and processed food as well as manufactured goods took part in the study. Questionnaires which were largely open-ended were administered. SPSS version 16 was used to analyse the data. In addition, some of the interview responses were included verbatim to support study participants view on some issues. Findings - The majority of the respondents engaged in trading of manufactured goods. The respondents understood climate change as prolonged dry season and changes in rainfall pattern. About 97 per cent of the respondents said climate change had negatively impacted their trading activities, and almost all respondents (91 per cent) who were affected by climate change livelihoods were also affected such that they were unable to meet their basic needs. About 23 per cent have adopted coping strategies by depending on friends, relatives and engaging in menial jobs, and 63 per cent adopted no coping strategy. Originality/value - It seems that rural farmers may have more options than urban traders during climate change. This can mean that research and policy efforts towards adaption to climate change should not focus only on farmers but traders as well.",0.8322482723540424,0.27551407768331493,0.08119188751270345,0.43549860925401185,0.04931628087280444,0.047150209529579705,0.022301914790720908
Understanding the role of networks in stimulating adaptation actions on the ground: Examples from two African case studies,"The networks that support collaboration and knowledge exchange around climate risk and response are emerging as central to climate adaptation. Yet, there is limited empirical knowledge about the conditions by which these networks can go beyond knowledge sharing to achieving on the ground. This paper presents two case studies of networks between universities, the private sector, civil society, and decision-makers at the local government level in different African municipalities: Karonga District (Malawi) and the Eden District (South Africa). The chapter considers conditions that enable collaboration to move from knowledge sharing to adaptation action. It does this by demonstrating how the origins of networks, the characteristics of partner organizations, the needs of each partner, the nature of the relationships between partners and the activities of the network, all combine to affect adaptation responses. For example, the high vulnerability of the Eden District to weather hazards prompted a private insurance company to collaborate with academics and local governments to understand how to reduce flood and fire risk to limit their insurance payouts in the region. The insurers invested in early warning systems and better fire response vehicles, as well as in a more holistic strategy of partnership, which has improved risk responses. The experiences presented in this paper highlight why and how networks can integrate knowledge from different partners into decision-making to result in adaptation actions on the ground. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.

"Opportunities and challenges for mainstreaming ecosystem-based adaptation in local government: evidence from the Western Cape, South Africa","Ecosystem-based adaptation can reduce social vulnerability to climate hazards and can be more sustainable in the long term than hard technical solutions to adaptation. Thus, it can provide a strong argument for the conservation of natural ecosystems. As the entities most directly responsible for local-level planning and management, municipalities represent a potentially key site for implementing ecosystem-based climate adaptation. This paper presents the results of a study that investigated the extent of eight local municipalities' knowledge and mainstreaming of ecosystem-based adaptation issues in the Western Cape, South Africa. Most municipalities had little understanding of ecosystem-based adaptation issues and limited implementation of relevant actions. Our findings suggest that ecosystem-based adaptation mainstreaming in local governments will be assisted by increasing learning and networking opportunities for municipalities and by increasing the ""profile"" of the concept of ecosystem-based adaptation, as well as by conducting research on barriers and enablers to collaborative governance.",0.20792728758705262,0.3528215650889705,0.1985890905485982,0.22183936040404337,0.17356837929206317,0.23002563742191764,0.11591051432106231
"Diagnosing barriers to climate change adaptation at community level: reflections from Silobela, Zimbabwe","The limits to climate change adaptation existing in many places experiencing climatic events are evident in Silobela, a dryland district in central Zimbabwe. Current understanding about failure in adaptation systems tends to be generalised and course-grained. Yet, experiences for coping with and adapting to climate change tend to be local-specific, varying according to the magnitude and severity of climatic events. This study utilises the experiences of locals witnessing environmental changes associated with climate change. It uses participatory climate impact analysis to understand whether available livelihoods coping practices can withstand climatic impacts. Participatory research was used to rank the spectrum of livelihood options according to their significance in the face of climate change-induced drought and other socio-economic pressures. A coping capacity index (CCI) was used to estimate the level of adaptation limit imposed by each livelihood strategy, with composite CCI values generated to compare the coping capacities of villages studied. Given that most of the livelihoods options are climate dependent, and combined with other non-climatic drivers of vulnerability that are besetting rural areas in Zimbabwe, we argue that adaptation limits abound. Most of these limits are explained by the limitation of the environment that the villagers largely depend on for their survival. With the analytic capabilities of participants engaged, the article isolates three departure points for adaptation research, policy and practice: understanding the type and magnitude of climatic hazards thatthe locals are exposed to; assessment of their coping capacities and determination of adaptation barriers; and using their knowledge of the local environment to suggest interventions for evading adaptation barriers.",0.6679876447044907,0.37454855239900525,0.11627087848536065,0.5928824894442769,0.06726470903752008,0.05974860516854712,0.13058777353181605
Rural organizations and adaptation to climate change and variability in rural Kenya,"Numerous studies have shown that collective action affects the type and efficiency of short- and long-term adaptation to climate change. This empirical study contributes to the body of the literature on collective action and adaptive capacity by demonstrating how organizations frame responses to climate variability and change in rural Kenya by promoting local rural institutions. By analyzing interviews, role-playing games, and household surveys, we ask how local rural organizations shape coping strategies to climate variability and how they may structure future adaptations to climate change. We also investigate what types of households participate in those organizations and how their participation may impact their vulnerability to climate change and variability. Our analysis shows that in places rendered especially vulnerable to climate change by arid climatic conditions, the disengagement of governmental services, and a limited access to income-generating activities, local rural organizations increase livelihood security. Those organizations reduce local vulnerabilities and enhance collective action. In contrast to common diversification and livelihood security strategies which rely on the access to urban or peri-urban structures, local rural institutions and organizations allow for rural and grassroots sustainable adaptation strategies. In that respect, they constitute a resilient and mostly untapped resource for visibly strengthening livelihood security and adaptive capacities in rural Kenya.",0.8026514999752453,0.30553994658474587,0.11118155550491733,0.5412702330109928,0.043756953345007586,0.04526263263191888,0.11872599856040245

Coping with and Adapting to Climate Change: A Gender Perspective from Smallholder Farming in Ghana,"The negative impacts of climate change on agriculture could erode gains made toward gender equality in Ghana. Much of the literature on gender dimensions of climate change adaptation has focused on assessing differences in coping and adaptation practices of smallholder farmers. Mostly overlooked is whether gender influences influenced perception of effectiveness of adaptation practices and preferences for institutional support for future adaptation. Using key informant interviews, household surveys, and focus group discussions, we address these gaps by exploring coping and adaptation measures adopted by heads of farm households to counter climate change impacts on their livelihood activities and household well-being in the Guinea Savanna agroecological zone in Ghana. Additionally, we assessed the preferred institutional adaptation support of heads of farm households in adapting to future projected impacts. We find that female heads of farm households relied mainly on borrowed money from village savings and loans group as a coping measure; male heads of farm households depended primarily on sales of livestock. Varying planting and harvesting dates, crop diversification, and use of improved crop varieties were the major adaptation strategies adopted by farmers. We argue that provision of dams and/or dugouts, postharvest processing facilities, adaptation capacity-building resources, and improved access to markets and credit could enhance the adaptive capacity of male and female heads of farm households to mitigate projected climate change impacts on their livelihood activities and household well-being.",0.9377232934712332,0.23535431721903755,0.09052700521784393,0.6527206908448165,0.03784867208464303,0.02215916204474818,0.030714712017860604

Synergizing climate change mitigation and adaptation in Cameroon An overview of multi-stakeholder efforts,"Purpose This paper aims to examine the policy environments, institutional arrangements and practical implementation of some initiatives undertaken by the Government of Cameroon, together with some relevant stakeholders, in addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation at various levels in the country, which are prerequisites to promote synergistic ways of addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation. Design/methodology/approach Using a qualitative approach to data collection, the paper draws upon information collected from relevant literature and interviews with 18 key country resource personnel. Findings Results revealed that most reviewed policies/programs/strategies do not mention ""climate change"" explicitly but propose some activities which indirectly address it. Interaction is fair within the government ministries but weak between these ministries and other institutions. Inadequate financial resources are being opined as the most important challenge stakeholders are (and would continue) facing as a result of adopting integrated approaches to climate change. Other challenges include inadequate coordination, insufficient sensitization and capacity building, ineffective implementation, inadequate compliance, lack of proper transparency and inadequate public participation. To redress the aforementioned constraints and challenges, the paper concludes by outlining a number of recommendations for policy design. Originality/value The following recommendations were made: create a national technical committee to oversee and provide scientific guidance to the government on synergistic approaches; promote private sector investment and sponsorship on synergistic approaches; create local awareness, etc. It is important to underscore that minimal studies have been conducted to analyze multi-stakeholder perspectives on synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation in Cameroon.

"Socio-Ecological Niche and Factors Affecting Agroforestry Practice Adoption in Different Agroecologies of Southern Tigray, Ethiopia","This study was carried out in the southern zone of Tigray to identify and characterize traditional common agroforestry practices and understand the existing knowledge of farm households on the management of trees under different agroforestry in different agroecologies. We conducted reconnaissance and diagnostic surveys by systematically and randomly selecting 147 farming households in the three agroecologies of the study area. A logit regression model was employed to determine how these factors influence farmers' adoption decision. The findings indicate that a majority of the households (46.3%) were engaged in homestead agroforestry practices (AFP), followed by live fence (25.9%) and farmland or parkland (15%) agroforestry practices. The study identified Carica papaya, Malus domestic, Persea americana, Mangifera indica, Ziziphus spina-christi, and Balanites aegyptiaca as the most dominant fruit tree species found in the home garden agroforestry. In total, 68% of the households had some of these fruit trees around their home gardens. We also established the three most dominant agricultural production systems as: i) Agricultural production system, composed of fruit tree + cereal crops + Ziziphus spina-christi + Balanites aegyptiaca and/or acacia species; ii) agricultural production system, consisting of cash crops, like Coffee arabica and Catha edulies + fruit trees + Cordia africana + Balanites aegyptiaca and/or acacia species; and iii) agricultural production, composed of fruit trees + vegetables within a boundary of Sesbania sesban and other acacia species in the modern irrigated land. Furthermore, 90.16% of the households in the highlands reported a shortage of farmland for planting trees as the main constraint. About 34.44% farmers reported using leaves of Cordia africana, Balanites aegyptiaca, pods of acacia species, and crop residue as the main source of animal fodder. In total, 86.4% of the households also recognized the importance of multipurpose trees for soil fertility enhancement, control of runoff, microclimate amelioration, environmental protection, and dry season animal fodder. According to the logit model analysis, sex, family size, educational level, and landholding significantly (p < 0.05) influence the household's role in the adoption of agroforestry practices. Based on these findings, farmers used different adaptation strategies, such as planting of multi-purpose trees (34.7%), conservation tillage to minimize both erosion and runoff potentials as soil conservation strategies (27.2%), varying planting dates, use of drought tolerant crop varieties (16.3%), and others based on farmers' indigenous knowledge passed down from generation to generation. We conclude that agroforestry practices are important components of farming systems in Tigray, resulting in diversified products and ecological benefits that improve socio-ecological resilience. Therefore, we recommend that agroforestry practices are mainstreamed into development plans, especially in agriculture.",0.9859451128573299,0.17237423768169427,0.22699207010680214,0.6281447098073901,0.0210179725916178,0.013340603289836887,0.03315522317119648
"Inclusion of climate change strategies in municipal Integrated Development Plans: A case from seven municipalities in Limpopo Province, South Africa","The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has made it clear that anthropogenic greenhouse gasses are the main cause of observed global warming that leads to climate change. Climate change is now a global reality. In the South African political set-up, local municipalities are the structures that are in direct contact with communities and they draw up Integrated Development Plans (IDPs), which are reviewed and upgraded annually. The article seeks to investigate the extent to which climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies are embedded IDPs in seven vulnerable municipalities in the Limpopo Province. The article conducted an in-depth content analysis of the IDPs of the seven municipalities and the results have revealed that these municipalities have not included adaptation and mitigation strategies adequately in their IDPs despite being the most vulnerable municipalities in the province. The article concludes that these municipalities have not as yet institutionalised climate change in their daily operations, planning and decision making. To this end, the paper recommends that local municipalities should include climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in their IDPs.",0.30468778999136586,0.3719498590299587,0.12181734736812895,0.3100021520971788,0.11116312161724277,0.22901325222728952,0.16055916696111597
Adaptations of the agricultural calendar and agricultural techniques to climate change in the highlands of cameroon,"From its inception with regard to climate change, scientists, stakeholders and policymakers did focus their efforts predominantly on mitigation. But since a decade now, efforts of the international community deal with adaptation, this being both a matter of need as climate change is now underway and a matter of equity as its impacts fall disproportionately worldwide. Climate change adaptation refers to actions that reduce the negative impact of climate change, while taking advantage of potential new opportunities. It involves adjusting policies and actions because of observed or expected changes in climate. Future impacts (if they are yet to be obvious) will affect a broad array of human and natural systems, including areas vital to economic and social well-being, such as agricultural. In fact, production of food crops is the most climate-dependent economic activity and changes in climate are expected to have significant impacts upon crop yields through changes in both temperature and moisture. Therefore, anticipating and adapting to these impacts in order to minimize their human and environmental toll is a significant challenge for all. Objective: As meeting that challenge requires action at multiple levels, from the international to the local this paper explores and evaluates the forms of adaptation of the agricultural calendar and cultivation techniques used to improve corn production in the context of family farming in Bantoum. Method: Data used here derive from field investigations conducted in the area in 2012. We did resort to both qualitative (participant observation) and quantitative (use of standardized questionnaires) techniques to collect data from the farmers. However, rainfall data came from the Bangangté forecasting station located 10 km from our study area and which has a similar climate based on the extent of the data series from 1980 to 2010. To highlight the surplus or deficit years, index of rainfall anomaly was calculated based on the Ozer and Erpicum method (Se`cheresse 6(1):103-108, 1995). Priority was given to the historical approach in order to capture changes to the agricultural calendar and corn production techniques over the years in the area. Results: This research highlights a strong inter-annual and seasonal variability of rainfall volumes which is detrimental to a good corn production in Bantoum. To come accross shortage of rainfalls, Bantoum farmers have modified their agricultural calendar by gradually abandoning the minor rainy season for cultivation in favor of a new production campaign, and by setting up a campaign during the long dry season in the swamps by using irrigation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",0.8858981763515845,0.224786002061694,0.08350765763004324,0.40545710708294325,0.04768901717871639,0.022070840500225813,0.028632051981738942
"Rainfall variability, floods and adaptations of the urban poor to flooding in Kumasi, Ghana","Flood is a normal ecosystem phenomenon and a natural hydrological feature of most river systems. Climate variability may also bring about precipitation events that cause floods. However, recent floods in most areas may be anthropogenically induced and are on a spatial and temporal increase. This study assessed rainfall variability, flooding and the adaptations of slum residents to floods in Kumasi, Ghana. Rainfall data of Kumasi were collected from the Meteorological Services Department, Accra. Basic descriptive statistics of rainfall data were used to evaluate the rainfall variability. The Mann-Kendall test was used to assess rainfall trends. A survey of residents of flood-prone suburbs was conducted to assess their vulnerability and adaptations to floods. The results show that rainfall in March and November is significantly decreasing. The floods in Kumasi are not due to climate change but bad spatial development practices. Most people will pump out water and build embankments around their houses as adaptations to the floods. Flooding in Kumasi will continue to outwit local government initiatives of storm drain construction because the floods are predominantly due to development of effluent streams and less from flash floods.",0.6294079391697214,0.27714532356580235,0.13417090796148998,0.4175243690946617,0.12135168355183759,0.1069780512635792,0.41170463756970005

"Linking population, fertility, and family planning with adaptation to climate change: perspectives from Ethiopia.","Global climate change is felt disproportionately in the world's most economically disadvantaged countries. As adaption to an evolving climate becomes increasingly salient on national and global scales, it is important to assess how people at the local-level are already coping with changes. Understanding local responses to climate change is essential for helping countries to construct strategies to bolster resilience to current and future effects. This qualitative research investigated responses to climate change in Ethiopia; specifically, how communities react to and cope with climate variation, which groups are most vulnerable, and the role of family planning in increasing resilience. Participants were highly aware of changing climate effects, impacts of rapid population growth, and the need for increased access to voluntary family planning. Identification of family planning as an important adaptation strategy supports the inclusion of rights-based voluntary family planning and reproductive health into local and national climate change adaptation plans.",0.26446565566745994,0.3767631067114276,0.14410291016861193,0.29304769567624356,0.07885064958243347,0.10628095948544637,0.1244867150761716
Impacts of drought and responses of rural populations in West Africa: a systematic review,"In West Africa, climate variations and droughts have always affected livelihoods but have also triggered adaptation strategies. A better understanding of the impacts of drought and the responses of West African populations is indispensable for researchers and decision makers in the current and future context of multiple socioeconomic and environmental changes, including climate change. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on drought in West Africa. In this paper, we highlight controversial issues and identify knowledge gaps. Although drought has been widely considered as a major problem in West Africa, there is a need to frame it within a set of multiple threats faced by local populations and to understand how droughts act as a trigger in economic, societal, and environmental contexts. The literature on responses to drought focuses on agricultural and individual responses, while diversification, migration, and tree-based or livestock-based responses are less frequently addressed. More research is needed on the effectiveness and on the unexpected effects of responses of populations, states, and NGOs, as well as on the interactions between different responses. To understand the complexity of impacts and responses, the context in which they occur and how individual and collective actions interact within households or communities needs to be taken into account. Ecosystems and agriculture offer many goods and services that are suitable for adaptation and the different landscape components should be analyzed together. Such historical, contextual, and integrated analyses would better inform new policies and projects for adaptation to climate change.

Intersections of Gender and Marital Status in Accessing Climate Change Adaptation: Evidence from Rural Tanzania,"Climate scholars are increasingly recognizing the importance of gender in climate change vulnerability, but often either dichotomize men and women as homogeneous categories or limit themselves to comparing male-and female-headed households. We use an intersectionality framework to examine how the adaptive strategies of Tanzanian farmers are mediated through their gender and marital statuses. Drawing on focus group discussions and using logistic regression to analyze questionnaire data, we compare the relative adoption of the different adaptive strategies of single, married, divorced, and widowed men and women. Our study shows that, while a woman's marital status is a vital factor in determining her access to adaptive strategies, it is a less important factor in the case of men. We show that, compared with other women, widows and female divorcees are disadvantaged in the field of agricultural water management, and divorced women assume relatively more income-earning activities outside the farming sector. Finally, we find evidence of livelihood diversification at the household level through specialization by individual household members. Based on the empirical evidence, we develop a typology with which to synthesize the linkages between gender, marital status, and adaptive strategies; and we subsequently emphasize the importance of an intersectionality approach to gender and climate change policy and practice.

Strategies of smallholder farmers for coping with the impacts of cyclones: A case study from Madagascar,"In many tropical countries, smallholder farmers are highly vulnerable to cyclones and experience significant crop losses, food insecurity and income loss when cyclones hit. Madagascar has one of the highest rates of cyclones globally and a population comprised primarily of smallholder farmers, yet there is little information on how Malagasy smallholder farmers prepare for and cope with the cyclones. We conducted interviews with 200 Malagasy smallholder farmers following the impacts of cyclone Giovanna (a category 4 cyclone that struck in February 2012) to understand how farmers prepared for the cyclone, how the cyclone impacted their livelihoods and what strategies farmers used to deal with these impacts. Most farmers prepared for the cyclone by storing clean water; some also secured their buildings and stored food and seeds. Cyclone Giovanna caused substantial damage to crops, stored grains and houses, and significantly reduced farmer food security. Farmers coped with the cyclone by replanting crop fields, rebuilding homes with local materials, reducing consumption of staple foods, harvesting wild foods and finding temporary work to buy food. Informal social networks were critical for providing food and rebuilding houses. There is an urgent need for governments, donors, and development organizations to reduce the vulnerability of Malagasy smallholder farmers to cyclones by improving early warning systems, increasing farmer preparedness for cyclones, creating formal safety nets to help farmers access food and essential supplies following cyclones, and promoting the use of adaptation measures to enhance the resiliency of smallholder farmers to future climate shocks.

Envisioning the future and learning from the past: Adapting to a changing environment in northern Mali,"In West Africa, rural livelihoods depending on natural resources develop coping and adapting strategies to face climate variability or change and economic or political changes. The former Lake Faguibine in northern Mali has experienced drastic ecological, social, and economic changes. Forests have emerged on the former lake and have become important for local livelihoods. This paper analyses the coping and adapting strategies of forest- and livestock-based livelihoods facing ecological changes. Results from field research at different levels indicate that most local strategies are based on diversification including migration within the livestock production system or in complement to it, with differences according to gender, age, and ethnicity. Political discourses, cultural identities, and past experiences influence and shape adaptation strategies at the local level. The sustainability of the observed strategies depends on the access to natural resources and the sustainable management of these resources, which in turn depends on institutions at local and national levels. Many local strategies are reactive to external events but would need strategic support from higher levels to move from coping to adapting. Examples are the development of institutions and technical actions for natural resource management, as well as development actions supporting local strategies and sustainable investments. Researchers, practitioners and development planners will need simple methods and tools for understanding and analysing local adaptation perceptions and actions to achieve an effective support of sustainable and gender-equitable local adaptation and to avoid mismatches between strategies proposed by local and by sub national and national actors.

"Evaluating smallholder farmers' preferences for climate smart agricultural practices in Tehuledere District, northeastern Ethiopia","This study was conducted in Tehuledere district, northeastern Ethiopia. The objective was to find out farmers' preferences for, and barriers to, adopting climate smart agricultural (CSA) practices. Both primary and secondary sources of data were collected using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Conjoint experiment method was employed to identify the most preferred attributes of CSA practices. We found that high and moderate climate resilience and high crop yield agricultural practices had a positive utility, implying that these were the most preferred combination of CSA when responding to climate change. Contrary to this, high greenhouse gas emissions, low climate resilience and low crop yield had a negative utility, implying that these were the least preferred combination of CSA when responding to climate change. The study found that crop yield and resilience are the most important factors influencing farmers' preferences for CSA practices. The main barriers limiting wide adoption and practicing of CSA include inadequate law enforcement, lack of incentives, inadequate and unreliable extension and weather information. The study established that CSA practices were viable and effective response measures, hence increased support through adoption of innovative technologies, policies and strategies to address the barriers and widen the adoption scope of CSA is recommended.",0.9504096135415584,0.21244565818094613,0.09241629778341162,0.5521014925626303,0.027403548207093963,0.03190031243175181,0.03217381861261149
Farmers' intrinsic values for adopting climate-smart practices in Kenya: empirical evidence from a means-end chain analysis,"This study assesses intrinsic values and motivations farmers have for adopting various climate-smart agricultural practices in Kenya. The qualitative method of laddering was employed as an interview technique, and means-end chain analysis was used for hierarchical mapping in order to depict farmers' decision-making processes concerning the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices as well as their envisioned goals and values underpinning these actions. The findings show that farmers decided on measures that improved farm productivity, food security and household income. The study highlights that an irreconcilable conflict between values exists due to changing climate conditions. It will be difficult for women attached to conservative values to pursue achievement or benevolence values. Similarly, male-differentiated values suggest a need for a trade-off of their self-enhancement values that oppose universalism values related to environmental sustainability and welfare for all. The findings call for the design of climate change policies and adaptation interventions that take into account farmers' fundamental values and their gendered preferences.",0.8698383711774461,0.24439245393549966,0.09488627799660203,0.4449193018575431,0.04062953605389176,0.03441690709708781,0.025243503262415663
Farmers' decisions to adapt to climate change under various property rights: A case study of maize farming in northern Benin (West Africa),"Making the assumption that property rights might determine whether farmers adopt particular strategies, this study aims at modelling farmers' decisions to adapt to climate change by focusing on their property rights - declined as institutional arrangements on land and rights on land - as well as their socio-economic and demographic characteristics. The case study took place in northern Benin (West Africa). In this zone, 308 farmers producing maize and adapting to climate change were randomly sampled. The study was conducted by a survey method on respondents using structured interviews based on a questionnaire. A simultaneous modelling using a Multivariate Probit (MVP) model highlighted that socio-economic and demographic characteristics, institutional arrangements on land, and rights on land determine the farmers' decisions to adapt to climate change. The land ownership has a positive effect on the decision to adopt any adaptation strategy. Subsequently, securing farmers' property rights would help to enhance their capacity to adapt to climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Evaluating farmers' adaptation strategies to climate change: A case study of Kaou local government area, Tahoua State, Niger Republic","The study discusses local farmers' strategies of coping with and building resilience against the negative impact of climate change. Information for the discussion was from data collected using a set of structured questionnaires from interviews scheduled with 128 farmers. The questionnaire was based on previous literature and direct reconnaissance interview with farmers, which culminated in 13 strategies used for the study being reported. For each question, respondents were asked to choose their best and worst strategies. Thus, the difference between the best and worst strategies consistent with random utility theory has been used for the modelling. Results show that semi-transhumance, various handicrafts making, rural migration, small-scale vegetable production and small-scale river exploitation were the most important strategies identified, whilst water transport and vending, shifting cultivation, gypsum mining, gathering and trading of wild fruits and edible plants as well as cattle and sheep fattening were the least appreciated strategies identified amongst the farmers facing climate change. These findings are therefore imperative for planning farmers' capacity-building and resilience against climate change projects to ensure sustainability in the study area.",0.8954424020983851,0.25271395837815386,0.0686331829597736,0.5165287815031235,0.04902627793385005,0.034753514444192925,0.056793818665519726
Climate change adaptation in the Sahel,"Climate change adaptation now occupies central stage on the agenda of most environmental initiatives in Africa. Our current understanding on the state of adaptation is limited, however, both globally and in Africa in particular. This study examines the status of adaptation in the Sahel by reviewing the primary peer review literature that reports concrete climate change adaptation actions. Based on an analysis of 70 peer review papers that document 414 discrete adaptations, we create a snap shot of adaptations developed between 1975 and 2015, and also calculate the percentages of adaptation. The results show that from a country to country perspective, Kenya has the highest number of reported adaptation actions (75 or 18.1%). The percentages indicate that the adaptive capacity of the entire study area is generally low for all the countries being that the highest country-level percentage is recorded in Kenya and it is 18%. Regionally, West Africa has more adaptation actions (261 or 63%) when compared to other regions of the Sahel. Regional level percentages suggest a higher level of adaptation at the regional level being that the percentage falls within the high scale range. The most commonly used adaptation actions reported are income diversification and water harnessing respectively. When categorized, technically related adaptation actions dominate the adaptation charts. The decade 2008-2016 recorded the highest number of adaptations (65.2%). Adaptation actions are also reported to be triggered by climatic and non-climatic drivers which both record high frequencies but the climatic drivers (98%) of adaptation are slightly dominant relative to the non-climatic drivers (95%). These results should be viewed as proxies of climate change adaptation as much information may be found in grey literature and non-peer review national communications which are left out here because of their relative low standardization and acceptability due to the absence of peer review.",0.44396544976660257,0.3113701442778044,0.18991409435466075,0.31987868486229115,0.12822230539456048,0.12048841288277708,0.14162352474366746
Exploring Long-Term Livelihood and Landscape Change in Two Semi-Arid Sites in Southern Africa: Drivers and Consequences for Social-Ecological Vulnerability,"This paper investigates the drivers and dynamics of livelihood and landscape change over a 30-year period in two sites in the communal drylands of Zimbabwe (Marwendo) and South Africa (Tshivuhulani). Of particular interest to us was how access to social protection and a wider range of options may mitigate increased vulnerability under a changing climate. A mixed methods approach (using household surveys, focus group discussions, life history interviews, transect walks and secondary sources of data) was applied to develop human-environment timelines for each study site. Findings indicate that prolonged periods of droughts, unreliable rainfall, changing socioeconomic policies and development-related projects were among the major drivers of both positive and negative change in both villages. Marwendo, in particular, experienced a suite of negative drivers in the last 10 years that increased vulnerability and forced households to diversify into potentially maladaptive activities. In contrast, the expansion in social grants in Tshivhulani provided an important safety net that reduced vulnerability, but also led to a decline in farming and a narrowing of livelihood activities for some households. We demonstrate that rural development initiatives such as electrification and road construction can strengthen local people's capacity to respond to drivers of change, while new methods of farming and diversification of the livelihood portfolio can make them more climate-resilient. However, long-term changes in landscapes and ecosystem services and feedbacks on livelihoods could reverse some of the benefits of development by eroding the natural capital many households still depend on.",0.8165366300273549,0.31931653220512307,0.09528495010376645,0.7498872601052462,0.0692617337545558,0.03424877464526533,0.06264891192962052

Impacts of Climate Change on Small Holder Households in Mt. Elgon Region of Uganda: Does Gender Matter?,"Agriculture, the main livelihood activity for several communities in Uganda, is threatened by short- and long-term changes in temperatures and precipitation. The increasing involvement of women in agriculture has attracted a myriad of gender-climate studies. However, much of the focus has concentrated on the usual gender dichotomy that assumes homogeneity within gender identities. This study is based on the premise that while an evaluation of male- and female-headed households is important, it only forms an initial stride in understanding climate change impacts’ and adaptation analyses. Using focus group discussions and household surveys, this study unveils the climate change adaptation dynamics created by the different positions that men and women hold across defined household typologies in the Mt. Elgon region. The results indicate that male divorced/separated/widowed households are more impacted by crop failure than female divorced/separated/widowed households. Across the households, adult male and female vulnerability was attributed mainly to a limited asset ownership portfolio. Due to ownership of more diverse assets, coupled households had more flexibility to engage in a number of adaptive/coping strategies compared to any other household type. Women in coupled households were also more likely to adapt to crop failure compared to women in other household types, given that they have some access to and use rights of their spouse’s assets. Given these dynamics, it is concluded that issues of gender and climate change are multifaceted and that meaningful design and implementation of adaptation strategies should not view “male,” “female,” and “household” as homogeneous categories but rather recognize their variation in adaptation process. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",0.8391781149470521,0.28837390697234255,0.08689456334746529,0.6614508849802755,0.0539459452607674,0.021228081010072886,0.14449817192966352
"Lessons learned in the replication and scaling-up of rainwater harvesting technologies in arid and semi-arid areas: A case study of Kilifi County, Kenya","In the arid and semi-arid lands in Kenya, agricultural water scarcity, which is characterized by high rainfall variability, is the most significant determinant of livelihood risks and food insecurity. Despite rainwater harvesting holding significant potential for sustaining dryland production systems, its adoption and replicability are still low. This paper analyses the lessons learnt in promoting the adoption and replication of rainwater harvesting technologies and small-scale irrigation in the arid and semi-arid lands in Kenya. The findings demonstrate that rainwater harvesting technologies have a huge potential in promoting climate resilience and food security. This paper shows that, in order to optimize the production potential of rainwater technologies, policy makers should integrate biophysical and socioeconomic conditions in the design and implementation. The potential to adopt, replicate and scale-up can further be catalysed using participatory technology development and dissemination approach. This approach can provide a platform to combine better land management and good agronomic practices that can enhance the production potential of rainwater harvesting technologies. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",0.911952087647071,0.23069791300275733,0.11455098646321604,0.5459671346853122,0.03271921012583363,0.03128661747606003,0.20834652403271864
Rethinking identity in adaptation research: Performativity and livestock keeping practices in the Kenyan drylands,"Adaptation research often uses identity categories. This article argues that a performativity approach allows us to understand identity in ways that are important for adaptation. Performativity sees identity as constructed through practices in an ongoing process of negotiation and renegotiation. Individuals and groups can thus be understood as having the agency to redefine identity by changing their everyday practices; changed practices, in turn, can influence the construction of identity. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted with pastoral and agro-pastoral livestock keepers in West Pokot County, Kenya, the article focuses on one set of identity-linked and adaptation-relevant practices: those involved in ensuring that livestock receive water regularly. Practices of livestock keeping reveal how identity is both implicated by and constructs the social context - between and within individuals, families, and communities, but also in relation to livestock and wider biophysical phenomena. By focusing on the changing practices of livestock watering within a changing social and biophysical context, it is possible to extract not only normative practices, but also a number of practices that disturb settled patterns, contesting or resisting identity constructs. This agency to change practices and identity has important implications for adaptation, which also requires changes in practice and behaviour. As this diversity and fluidity of identity as constructed and practised in the present emerges, so do the different ideas of what it can and will mean to be a livestock keeper in relation to the contextual challenges of today and the future.

Relating perceptions of flood risk and coping ability to mitigation behavior in West Africa: Case study of Burkina Faso,"The recent increase of devastating floods in West Africa implies an urgent need for effective flood risk management. A key element of such management is understanding how perceptions affect the implementation of mitigation measures. This paper uses the technique of framework analysis in conjunction with the conceptual framework of protection motivation theory to interpret flood perceptions and mitigation actions of flood victims and public officials in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso as conveyed through in-depth semi-structured interviews. The results show that, despite the experience of a devastating flood in 2009 and clear understandings of flood causes, mitigation actions in Ouagadougou after the 2009 flood varied widely. This occurred due to adverse perceptions that mitigation actions are costly and that personal ability and responsibility to effect change is limited. These adverse perceptions offset neutral or positive perceptions that mitigation measures, if correctly implemented, are effective, and that the risk of flooding is high. The paper concludes with a comparative meta-analysis of West Africa flood perception and mitigation literature that reveals the need for actionable studies on the implementation of specific measures for flood risk management.",0.09715389977823997,0.2955535233394032,0.0789335647607337,0.11471461982454009,0.14420990865085825,0.5707546600456155,0.47134379768192436
Households' perception of flood risk and health impact of exposure to flooding in flood-prone informal settlements in the coastal city of Mombasa,"Purpose - Mombasa City in Kenya is one of the most vulnerable towns to flood risk due to its low-lying coastal location. Those at the highest risk in the city are households living in the flood-prone informal settlements. However, little is known about the perception of these vulnerable households to the flood risks and its health impacts, which is important for developing effective long-term adaptation strategies. The purpose of this paper is to examine the general perception of the residents regarding flood risks, its impact on their health and their adaptation strategies. Design/methodology/approach - This study surveyed 390 randomly selected households in three informal settlements in the city of Mombasa using a semi-structured questionnaire. This was supplemented with six focus group discussions (FDGs) and six key informant interviews (KIIs). Findings - The majority of respondent households perceive future flooding as high risk or severe with high negative health impact. Despite this, many do not evacuate their homes because they do not have alternative places to move to. Flooding was indicated to have had a negative physical and mental health impact on members of households. Although majority of households had taken some adaptation measures, most of these were short term, mainly due to financial constraints, lack of knowledge and government support. Perception of flood risk and gender were found to have a strong influence on taking long-term adaptation measures at the household level. Practical implications - Reducing flood risk and averting its health consequences in flood-prone informal settlements require empowering and supporting those living in these areas with ability to initiate long-term adaptation measures and creating awareness about future risks. Originality/value - This study provides evidence about how residents of flood-prone informal settlements perceive flood risk and how the exposures to perennial flooding impact their health.

Local community perception of climate change adaptation in Egypt,"Climate change policies in countries of the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region are evolving from a top-down, government-led approach towards more pluralistic climate governance, which incorporates a local perspective and actors while strengthening the communities' resilience. Egypt, as a case study with high economic and natural vulnerability to climate change, and a significant number of vulnerable communities, is struggling to coordinate and effectively manage current sketchy climate policies. This paper examines the perception of climate change in four urban and rural communities, and their adaptation needs. Results show high local awareness and diverse ad-hoc adaptation strategies.

"'Rising Waters Don't Lift All Boats': a sustainable livelihood analysis of recursive cycles of vulnerability and maladaptation to flood risk in rural Bihar, India","Bihar, in the central Gangetic Basin, is simultaneously India's poorest and most flood-prone State. Climate change models currently identify a heightening of Bihar's flood risk, as rainfall patterns become more intense and Himalayan glaciers recede. During the past half century, the major strategy deployed by the State and national governments to address the risk of floods has involved the construction of embankments: raised areas of land that seek to control river flow and provide temporary sanctuaries for flood-affected populations. In this article, qualitative data from interviews with flood-affected villagers and policy makers at local, district and State levels are used to assess the social implications of embankments as an adaptive response to flood risk. Evidence from these testimonies leads us to conceptualise embankments as contributing to recursive cycles of vulnerability, in which women, children and poorer social segments have been unwitting bearers. Hence, reliance on embankments is a maladaptation that perpetuates, if not exacerbates, the severe manifestations of social and economic inequality that continue to plague rural Bihar. Perhaps not surprisingly, the voices of those whose lives have been made more difficult by embankments are heard all too infrequently in policy debates. This emphasises the need for climate adaptation initiatives to be anchored in a sustainable livelihood approach, for which the prime analytical objective is to understand the factors that enable or constrain the abilities of people, especially those who are most vulnerable, to make decisions about their lives.",0.26956744765704793,0.38163456023669867,0.12830047577600168,0.3824727992810796,0.08490272460049579,0.3075640778678787,0.5602739487255672
Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DRR) through coastal afforestation in South-Central Coast of Bangladesh,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to focus on the local-level initiatives through coastal afforestation, the natural and socio-economic context of the study area (Hatiya Upazila of Noakhali District, Bangladesh) and the adaptation and DRR strategies generated through coastal afforestation in coastal Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach Field observations, focus group discussions (FGDs), semi-structured interviews, and transects were accomplished in both the dry and wet season. Spatial database generated and land use mapping integrated social and technical investigation. Five FDG sessions with participants from different livelihood options (fishermen, farmers and social representatives) were organised and, on average, 15 similar to 18 participants participated in each participatory session. Findings Mangrove plantation can be used to access new land and create alternative livelihoods, which are important for local community adaptation and to reduce disaster risks. Mangrove plantations provide chances for new land management options to be developed for use in Bangladesh. Research limitations/implications - This study was conducted only at the south-central coastal district of Bangladesh. Data collection to summarise all the socio-economic issues is limited. Practical implications - This paper can be used for the integration of geospatial and social research techniques to understand the community approach to fight against climate change-induced impacts.

Social capital and local institutions: A perspective to assess communities adaptation potential to climate change,"Communities residing in Himalayan mountain environment are particularly at risk to climate changes externalities owing to their high dependence on natural resources, relatively high contact to severe climatic events, and prevalent economic and infrastructural marginalization. The present article tries to explore the nature of local society-environment interactions, particularly the role of social institutions and social capital in adaptive capacity to possible climate change impacts in Miyar watershed situated in the northeastern part of Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh, India. The first part of the article deals with climate change perception among local communities and the following part deals with identification and evaluation of adaptive capacities and prevailing institutional mechanisms. Study findings indicate that local community in Miyar valley, over the time, has developed variety of efficient resource (natural and human) management strategies and institutions (like Jowari system and Kuhl Committee, etc.) formed as a result of social cohesiveness (social capital), collective action, and common motivation to deal with boThenvironmental and nonenvironmental changes. These aspects of local institutions and social capital are directly related to resource management and community development, but it also provides a buffer zone for the communities to adapt against any future changes (climatic variability, social or economic, etc.) up to some extent. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",0.4653629554001663,0.5440498496673171,0.15953792490548088,0.49275750196614093,0.1669082132438695,0.07626011425873128,0.2733083417421464
Patterns in household-level engagement with climate change in Indonesia,"Understanding how individuals engage with climate change is critical for developing successful climate adaptation policies(1). Indonesia ranks among the world's top CO2 emitters(2), affirming its relevance to the global climate change policy arena, yet the dynamics of climate change engagement in Indonesia may differ from developed countries from which much research on this issue derives(3). We surveyed 6,310 households in two Indonesian regions to investigate patterns in four steps of engagement: observation, risk perception, reactive action (in response to present climate change) and proactive action (in anticipation of future climate change). We show that 89.5% of households exhibited a pattern whereby taking each of these steps in sequence implied taking all steps that precede it. Exceptions occurred in urban areas, where households were more likely to take action without having observed climate change or perceiving risks. In rural areas, households were more likely to observe climate change without taking action. These variations suggest a potentially nonlinear relationship between steps of engagement. We distinguish three types of household requiring adaptation support, and stress that Indonesian climate policy should shift emphasis from raising awareness to identifying broader institutional structures and processes to facilitate household engagement.",0.39909743044071366,0.3679747350031524,0.11407564709003094,0.2922862677117367,0.06611855771572797,0.13758734685015264,0.09606997933720042
"Exploring the climate change concerns of striped catfish producers in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam","This study investigated the perceptions on and adaptations to climate change impacts of 235 pangasius farmers in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Data were collected using semi-structured household surveys in six provinces, from three regions along the Mekong river branches. A Chi-Square test was used to determine the association between variables, and a logit regression model was employed to identify factors correlated with farmer's perception and adaptation. Less than half of respondents were concerned about climate change and sought suitable adaptation measures to alleviate its impacts. Improving information on climate change and introducing early warning systems could improve the adaptive capacity of pangasius farmers, in particularly for those farmers, who were not concerned yet. Farmers relied strongly on technical support from government agencies, but farmers in the coastal provinces did not express the need for training by these institutions. This contrasting result requires further assessment of the effectiveness of adaptation measures such as breeding salinity tolerant pangasius.",0.9350659741436997,0.22257208282552848,0.09894807934885703,0.37206702682509024,0.07210039080985622,0.02695085368730693,0.07819220377922645
A GIS-based tool for initiating climate change adaptation strategies for Taiwan's highway and railway systems,"Climate change adaptation has been an important topic around the globe and coping with extreme weather events have become much more commonplace. Considering the impacts of climate change to the transportation systems, the Institute of Transportation, MOTC (IOT) in Taiwan has launched a multi-year project to develop a GIS-based adaptation platform, which displays the highway and railway's risks to flood and slope hazards. Utilizing the vulnerable roads identified by the platform and current adaptation measures taken by the highway and railway administrations, this paper identifies climate change challenges and drafted adaptation strategies accordingly. The platform's risk map also help to provide information for the administrations' decision makers to implement adaptive strategies. The most important adaptation strategy is to incorporate adaptation ideology into the decision-making process for prioritization and budget allocation. The platform acts as a decision support tool, where continuous maintenance and further refinement could better assist transportation administrations in initiating their adaptation strategies. © 2018 Transportation Systems in the Connected Era - Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference of Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies, HKSTS 2018.

Optimisation of Flooding Recovery for Malaysian Universities,"Malaysia's 11th Five Year Plan (2016-2020) emphasises the need for strengthening of disaster risk management strategies. This is in accordance with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030), which calls for substantial global reductions in the occurrence of disasters by 2030. Flooding in Malaysia normally occurs after heavy rains, especially during the monsoon seasons. The resulting floods are increasing in severity because of climate change, to the point where serious flooding is occurring almost every year. The effects of flooding are extensive and widespread all over the country, with consequential loss of life and property. The infrastructure of the Malaysian university sector is not immune from these effects. Recovery to an operational state may be highly problematic, especially if research and teaching infrastructure is damaged. The recovery process may be complex and would be aided by the implementation of strategies leading to improved resilience to flooding, as both processes require co-ordination among many stakeholders. At present, there is an almost total lack of information on flooding recovery strategies improvement in the context of the Malaysian university sector, and this is a matter of some concern. This paper describes potential improvements to apply to Malaysian universities' current measures for handling the aftermath of flooding. The objective of the paper is to review relevant literatures related to flooding recovery planning in Malaysian universities. The main methodologies used in this study include a literature review and interviews with stakeholders. © 2018 The Authors.

"From snow skiing to grass skiing: Implications of climate change for the ski industry in Dizin, Iran","This paper is concerned with climate change and its implications, making particular reference to Dizin in Iran which is one of the country's leading snow ski resorts. The impacts of climate change on ski businesses are examined, alongside the consequences for local communities, their economies, and overall sustainability. In addition, attention is given to responses by affected enterprises and other stakeholders to the problems caused by falls in demand for snow skiing due to decreasing snow cover attributed to global warming. Adaptive strategies focus on marketing and product diversification with attempts to develop other nature-based pursuits throughout the year as an alternative to that of skiing, but there are concerns about the future among those who rely on snow skiers for a livelihood. Findings are derived from original research incorporating 30 interviews with those involved in the ski industry in Dizin, including residents from a nearby village. © 2014 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",0.429696471791187,0.3697234546750451,0.14222278753345943,0.3546731718352837,0.07343709642178,0.08305691134633317,0.08956242579290025
"Are preventive and coping measures enough to avoid loss and damage from flooding in Udayapur district, Nepal?","This case study examines household vulnerability and responses in relation to flooding in Udayapur district, Nepal. It describes how communities in this region deal with flooding and asks to what extent their preventive, coping, and adaptation measures have been successful in avoiding loss and damage. A 300-household survey, along with open interviews and focus group discussions, revealed a wide range of strategies that families adopt in relation to flooding. In situ measures - such as the construction of sand embankments, stonewalls, and bamboo fences - are frequently used measures to control floods and prevent impacts. The most common coping strategies in Udayapur district are outmigration for labour and reliance on non-food income, social networks, and external support. The results show that despite high adoption rates, for a majority of the households, preventive and adaptation measures are often not enough to avoid loss and damage.",0.4435786793093671,0.3694729891704331,0.09137691807876895,0.48996317789459076,0.060335948407881285,0.14606460203669916,0.5097247342292922
Integrating the effects of flood experience on risk perception with responses to changing climate risk,"Flood management decision-makers face significant challenges as the climate changes. The perceptions of those affected by floods are critical to the successful implementation of adaptation responses; risk perceptions are affected by how information is communicated and, in turn, perceptions influence expectations on flood risk managers to respond. The links between flood experience, risk perception, and responses by individual households were examined in the Hutt Valley, New Zealand, through a household survey, a workshop and interviews with local government practitioners. Two propositions were tested: (1) that flood experience can influence flood risk perceptions; and (2) that flood experience can stimulate increased risk reduction and adaptation actions where changing climate risk is likely. Perceptions of responsibility for flood management were also examined. The study found that previous flood experience contributes to heightened perception of risk, increased preparedness of households, greater willingness to make household-level changes, greater communication with councils, and more advocacy for spatial planning to complement existing structural protection. Flood-affected households had a stronger preference for central government and communities having flood risk responsibilities, in addition to local government. Those who lacked experience were more likely to be normalised to their prior benign experiences and thus optimistic about flood consequences. These results suggest that harnessing positive aspects of experience and communication of changing risk through engagement strategies could help shift the focus from citizens' expectation that governments will always provide protection, to a citizen-local government-central government dialogue about the changing character of flood risk and its implications, and build a 'risk conscious' society in which 'sharing and bearing' is considered desirable.",0.09972872557157018,0.3793834208700656,0.07328810009487302,0.1574824994867181,0.1865852675288713,0.5389620903662654,0.6320659560814087
Farmers' response and adaptation strategies to climate change in low-hills of Himachal Pradesh in India,"The study examined the farmers' perceptions regarding climate change, types of adaptation strategies, factors influencing adaptation choices and barriers to adaptation, in the low-hill zone of Himachal Pradesh in India. In low-hill zone, 202 farm households were randomly considered for the study. In the region, 62.4 % of the farm households were of the opinion that temperature has increased during the last 10 years, whereas, 57.9% of the respondents have perceived that there is a decrease in rainfall in low-hills of the state. In this part of the state, people have switched over to off farm jobs to meet their livelihood as perceived by 89.1 percent of the respondents. At farm level, farmers have adopted irrigation, crop diversification, change of sowing/planting dates and crop variety as the strategies to cope up with the changing situation. About 50% of the people have perceived that high cost of adaptation, limited knowledge of adaptation measures, lack of access to technology, labour availability and early weather warnings were the main barriers to climate change adaptation. In the region, adaptation to climate change was influenced by education level, household and farm size, access to irrigation and credit, and number of salaried persons in the household.",0.9719536586318871,0.1806596782307721,0.07401915296067887,0.6397634165673136,0.040364688169296746,0.016327767054070273,0.028486850026513407
"Climate Resilient Villages for Sustainable Food Security in Tropical India: Concept, Process, Technologies, Institutions, and Impacts","The world population is expected to increase by a further three billion by 2050 and 90% of the three billion will be from developing countries that rely on existing land, water, and ecology for food and well-being of human kind. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth assessment report (AR5) stated that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and is more pronounced since the 1950s. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850 and the globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 degrees C (0.65-1.06 degrees C) over the period of 1880-2012. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ranked 2015 as the hottest year on record. Climate change poses many challenges to growth and development in South Asia. The Indian agriculture production system faces the daunting task of feeding 17.5% of the global population with only 2.4% of land and 4% of water resources at its disposal. India is more vulnerable to climate change in view of the dependence of huge population on agriculture, excessive pressure on natural resources, and relatively weak coping mechanisms. The warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.6 degrees C, which is likely to impact many crops, negatively impacting food and livelihood security of millions of farmers. There are already evidences of negative impacts on yield of wheat and paddy in some parts of India due to increased temperature, water stress, and reduction in number of rainy days. Significant negative impacts have been projected under medium-term (2020-39) climate change scenario, for example, yield reduction by 4.5-9%, depending on the magnitude and distribution of warming. Since agriculture currently contributes about 15% of India's gross domestic product (GDP), a negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to roughly range from 0.7% to 1.35% of GDP per year. Indian agriculture, with 80% of farmers being smallholders (<0.5 ha) having diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, is monsoon-dependent rainfed agriculture (58%), about 30% of population undernourished, migration from rural to urban regions, child malnutrition etc., has become more vulnerable with changed climate or variability situations. During the past decade, frequency of droughts, cyclone, and hailstorms increased, with 2002, 2004, 2009, 2012, and 2014 being severe droughts. Frequent cyclones and severe hailstorms in drought prone areas have become common. Eastern part of the country is affected by seawater intrusion. Reduced food grain productivity, loss to vegetable and fruit crops, fodder scarcity, shortage of drinking water to animals during summer, forced migration of animals, severe loss to poultry and fishery sectors were registered, threatening the livelihoods of rural poor. Enhancing agricultural productivity, therefore, is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly the resource-poor, small, and marginal farmers who would be the most affected. In the absence of planned adaptation, the consequences of long-term climate change on the livelihood security of the poor could be severe. In India, the estimated countrywide agricultural loss in 2030 is expected to be over $ 7 billion that will severely affect the income of at least 10% of the population. However, this could be reduced by 80%, if cost-effective climate resilient measures are implemented. Climate risks are best addressed through increasing adaptive capacity and building resilience which can bring immediate benefits and can also reduce the adverse impacts of climate change. Climate resilient agriculture (CRA) encompasses the incorporation of adaptation and resilient practices in agriculture which increases the capacity of the system to respond to various climate-related disturbances by resisting damage and ensures quick recovery. Such disturbances include events such as drought, flood, heat/cold wave, erratic rainfall pattern, pest outbreaks, and other threats caused by changing climate. Resilience is the ability of the system to bounce back and essentially involves judicious and improved management of natural resources, land, water, soil, and genetic resources through adoption of best bet practices. CRA is a way to achieve short-and long-term agricultural development priorities in the face of climate change and serves as a bridge to other development priorities. It seeks to support countries and other actors in securing the necessary policy, technical and financial conditions to enable them to: (1) sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes in order to meet national food security and development goals, (2) build resilience and the capacity of agricultural and food systems to adapt to climate change, and (3) seek opportunities to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and increase carbon sequestration. These three conditions (food security, adaptation, and mitigation) are referred to as the ""triple win"" of overall CRA. The concept of climate resilient village (CRV) has been taken up by Government of India, to provide stability to farm productivity and household incomes and resilience through livelihood diversification in the face of extreme climatic events like droughts, cyclones, floods, hailstorms, heat wave, frost, and seawater inundation. Development of CRVs warrants establishment of a host of enabling mechanisms to mobilize and empower communities in the decision-making process to manage and recover from climate risks. The overall program of establishing CRVs have structured village level institutions such as Village Climate Risk Management Committee (VCRMC), custom hiring center (CHC) for farm implements, community seed and fodder banks, commodity groups etc. The establishment of CRVs was based on bottom-up approach with village community taking a central role in decision making on institutional requirements, technological interventions and supporting systems with able support from experts. In our knowledge, the CRV network of National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) is by far the largest outreach program involving farmer's participation ever undertaken in the field of climate change adaptation anywhere in the world. Planning, coordination, monitoring, and capacity building of the program at the country level is the responsibility of the research organization (ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture). At the district level, Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK; Farm Science Centre) under the Division of Agricultural Extension under Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), All India Coordinated Research Project for Dryland Agriculture (AICRPDA) centers and Transfer of Technology divisions of various ICAR Institutions across the country are responsible in implementing the project at village level through farmers' participatory approach. To address the climate vulnerabilities of the selected villages, different interventions were planned under the four modules; however, the specific intervention under each module for a particular village was need based and decided based on climatic vulnerability and resource situation of the particular village. The four intervention modules being implemented are (1) Natural resource management (in situ moisture conservation, biomass mulching, residue recycling, manure management, soil health card-based nutrient application, water harvesting and recycling for supplementary or life saving irrigation, improved drainage in high rainfall/flood prone villages, conservation tillage, and water saving irrigation methods). (2) Crop production module consisting of introduction of short-duration and drought/flood-tolerant varieties, modifications in planting dates for postrainy (winter) season crops to cope with terminal heat stress, water saving paddy systems (System of Rice Intensification, aerobic, direct seeding), frost management in fruit/vegetables, community nursery in staggered dates to meet delay in onset of monsoon, energy-efficient farm machinery through village CHC with timely completion of farm operation in limited sowing window, location specific intercropping systems, and suitable agroforestry systems. (3) Module III covers livestock and fisheries interventions through augmentation of fodder production, fodder storage methods, prophylaxis, and improved shelters for reducing heat stress in livestock, management of fish ponds/tanks during water scarcity and excess water, and promotion of livestock as climate adaptation strategy. (4) Module IV consists of village level institutions, collective marketing groups, introduction of weather-based insurance, and climate literacy though establishment of automated weather stations. Impacts of these climate resilient interventions in the villages were assessed through various resilience indicators, importantly, improved farm productivity, farm income, livelihoods at household and village level. Environmental impacts were assessed on improved soil carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge, vegetation and forest cover, and measurements of GHG emissions which were correlated with ex ante assessment of village level carbon balance and overall contribution to global warming potential. These 151 CRVs are learning sites for further expanding resilient villages to adjoining clusters and districts so that large number of villages will become part of the overall adaptation-led climate change mitigation mission in the country.",0.9409100913906939,0.20325992783844787,0.10460379704367996,0.4495317245579702,0.024670583272953947,0.025149853043179047,0.13849833288217003
"The nexus between extreme weather events, sexual violence, and early marriage: a study of vulnerable populations in Bangladesh","This study aims to explore whether a relationship exists between extreme weather events, sexual violence, and early marriage. We selected two districts in Bangladesh that are vulnerable to extreme weather events: Sunamganj, which experiences flash flooding, and Brahmanbaria, which experiences cyclones and related floods. Survey data was collected from 120 randomly selected household heads from two villages in these districts, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 household heads who indicated early marriage was a coping strategy for managing effects of weather events. The mixed-methods study finds that early marriage of daughters is a coping strategy for managing two negative consequences of extreme weather events. First, by minimizing household expenses, householders can pay for damage-related expenses. Second, unmarried daughters may be subject to sexual violence during a crisis, especially in temporary shelters, which would harm both the family's and daughter's reputation and prevent future marriage.",0.4580255364049367,0.35175091465614733,0.06254126804125053,0.39989465325467294,0.07006915070612177,0.11308051994924456,0.21766117299042592
China's drought strategies in rural areas along the Lancang River,"Given that climate change is likely to exacerbate drought in certain parts of the world, a critical issue is how appropriate context-relevant drought policy can be developed and implemented. This paper examines how China is developing policies to help local communities in the Lancang River Basin to cope with the problems of climate variability and change. The research process includes (a) content analysis of relevant policies at different levels of administration and (b) stakeholder interviews to examine how effective policies are at the local level along the Lancang River in Yunnan province. The paper concludes that China needs to provide more emphasis on (a) enhancing the adaptive capacity of institutions and individuals, (b) drought risk rather than disaster management, (c) enhancing coordination between different departments and levels of government, (d) decentralization in policymaking as local governments can make context-relevant comprehensive policies more easily and are less hierarchical in their relationships, (e) involving farmers or other stakeholders in decision making, (f) building up grass root organizations to support policy implementation to compensate for the retreat of governmental organizations from the local level and (g) adopting market mechanisms which are still in a nascent stage now.",0.40195912884555873,0.36241378575455363,0.11394445769991605,0.2363035450668145,0.07016879103665949,0.19594541872577595,0.2863509153754288
"Institutional climate change adaptation efforts among the Sherpas of the Mount Everest region, Nepal","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show the complexity in dealing with climate change adaptation at the local level, and to show how social and institutional factors in addition to the ecological challenges contribute to that complexity. Methodology/approach - This paper examines four institutional climate change activities and reveals how institutions currently address climate change, and how the Sherpas are involved in the process. It draws on three sorts of material: The interviews and observations conducted during my field research in 2010 and 2011; my personal experiences as a Sherpa woman; my recent participation in Sherpa face-to-face and online communities. Findings - Organizing institutional climate change activities to draw international attention alone are not sufficient to address climate change adaptation issues. Communities at the local level cannot be assumed to be homogeneous entities. Institutional climate change adaptation efforts cannot assume that by reaching out to a few individuals in the region they will benefit the whole. Institutional activities have increased receptivity to scientific climate change knowledge, but it has also increased fear of an impending doom, and anger over the continuous discussion of climate change without concrete actions. Research implications - Future research in the Everest region should include residents from all ethnic groups considering their historical contacts and interactions. Originality/value - It is crucial that not only the Sherpa agency (or lack of agency) or understandings are examined but the institutional engagements and delivery are also assessed to practically, effectively, and sustainably address the challenges of climate change adaptation.

Asking the right questions in adaptation research and practice: Seeing beyond climate impacts in rural Nepal,"Adaptation research and practice too often overlooks the wider social context within which climate change is experienced. Mainstream approaches frame adaptation problems in terms of the consequences that flow from biophysical impacts and as a result, we argue, ask the wrong questions. A complementary approach gaining ground in the field, foregrounding the social, economic and political context, reveals differentiation in adaptation need, and how climate impacts interconnect with wider processes of change. In this paper, we illustrate how this kind of approach frames a different set of questions about adaptation using the case of Nepal. Drawing on fieldwork and a review of literature, we contrast the questions that emerge from adaptation research and practice that take climate risk as a starting point with the questions that emerge from examination of contemporary rural livelihoods. We find that while adaptation efforts are often centred around securing agricultural production and are predicated on climate risk management, rural livelihoods are caught in a wider process of transformation. The numbers of people involved in farming are declining, and households are experiencing the effects of rising education, abandonment of rural land, increasing wages, burgeoning mechanisation, and high levels of migration into the global labour market. We find the epistemological framing of adaptation too narrow to account for these changes, as it understands the experiences of rural communities through the lens of climate risk. We propose that rather than seeking to integrate local understandings into a fixed, impacts-orientated epistemology, it is necessary to premise adaptation on an epistemology capable of exploring how change occurs. Asking the right questions thus means opening up adaptation by asking: 'what are the most significant changes taking place in people's lives?', along with the more standard: 'what are the impacts of climate change?' Viewing adaptation as occurring between and within these two perspectives has the potential to reveal new vulnerabilities and opportunities for adaptation practice to act upon.",0.3825631081325932,0.4761642516991721,0.14535841327238633,0.39119906311350544,0.0940131319856482,0.08310076248694424,0.12517178560245035
"Analyzing drought adaptation practices of sugarcane growers in Thanh Cong, Thach Thanh District, Thanh Hoa, Vietnam","To understand drought adaptation practices, we compared two groups of sugarcane growers in Thanh Cong commune, Thach Thanh district, Thanh Hoa province in Vietnam. Results of this study point out that farmers, depending on their preferred type of market channels, reacted differently to the impacts of drought. Contractual farmers paid more attention to the impact on sugarcane tillering and sugar content, while market-oriented farmers paid more attention to sugarcane colour, as this trait directly determined the market price on the cane that is either consumed as cane or as juice. In responding to water stress in the growing season, the open market-oriented farmers showed more flexibility in changing their cropping calendar. They were also more willing to invest in enhancing the water management system and in providing organic fertilizer than the contractual farmers. On the other hand, the low cane price and the harvesting date set in contract by the processing company lessened the contractual farmers' flexibility in investing in water management technologies; thus, hampering their adaptation to drought.",0.9599698365388466,0.19536666646086925,0.068712778276348,0.42883633399608734,0.021933868387267255,0.02248793204595489,0.19054524059255465

AN ANALYSIS OF CLIMATE ADAPTATION BY LIVESTOCK FARMERS IN THE ASIAN TROPICS,"This paper explores how southeast Asia farmers adapt to climate change. We develop three models: a logit model of livestock choice, an OLS model of total livestock value, and a multinomial logit model of species choice. The data were collected from five countries in Southeast Asia. We find that climate has a significant impact on farmers' livestock choice. We use three climate projections to predict future impacts. Climate change would increase the probability of raising livestock. However, the total value of livestock owned per livestock farm will shrink 9%-10%. Climate change will cause farmers to choose smaller animals such as ducks, goats, and chicken rather than larger animals.",0.8891098201430527,0.22909912334683938,0.09163614572129618,0.5,0.031997423487343774,0.03246704498572642,0.028083661280405323
Responding to the Millennium drought: comparing domestic water cultures in three Australian cities,"Adapting to water scarcity is a critical issue for many cities around the world as they respond to the influences of population growth, urbanisation and climate change. There is increasing recognition that geographic context has an impact on experiences of and approaches to domestic water use, but research comparing urban environments is scarce. This paper describes different domestic water cultures after the Millennium drought in three Australian cities-Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. All three cities have experienced drought, or severe water shortages, over the past 15 years, and each city has responded differently. The experience of water scarcity and water restrictions imposed by governments impacted on people's everyday lives in varied and profound ways. Drawing on quantitative data from a national survey (n = 5194) and qualitative data from focus groups, we found that a sense of water crisis led to household water conservation in Brisbane and Melbourne. In contrast, access to alternative water sources in Perth through desalination plants and household bores de-emphasised personal responses to household water conservation. The implications are that urban specific policies and interventions are needed to provide durable change in domestic water cultures. We argue that greater water sensitivity and responsiveness to water availability should be promoted in different urban centres, and that water supply solutions should be accompanied by initiatives that promote adoption of sustainable water practices and future resilience.",0.5758994138893702,0.22385738280057096,0.22235850713193228,0.18147107968836015,0.02888038811008389,0.3407330696269584,0.9858374877210039
Occupational diversification as an adaptation to rainfall variability in rural India,"Occupational diversification among household members in rural India is investigated as an adaptation strategy against the risks arising from the variability of local rainfall. Nationally representative household-level survey data are combined with the coefficient of variation of rainfall constructed based on historical rainfall data at the district level. The analysis finds that high rainfall variability has significant negative effects on the agricultural specialization of within-household occupational choices. This result is reinforced by the finding that improved access to irrigation, education, credit, roads, and postal services, is associated with a lower occupational diversification within families and a greater specialization of household members in agricultural-related employment.",0.7457861088542299,0.29895615885389826,0.08471624377799493,0.6009955507199088,0.03561386418123747,0.033865664374550644,0.14236284763026755
Using REDD plus Policy to Facilitate Climate Adaptation at the Local Level: Synergies and Challenges in Vietnam,"Attention has recently been paid to how REDD+ mitigation policies are integrated into other sectoral policies, particularly those dealing with climate adaptation at the national level. But there is less understanding of how subnational policy and local projects are able to incorporate attention to adaptation; therefore, we use a case study in Vietnam to discuss how REDD+ projects and policies address both concerns of mitigation and adaptation together at subnational levels. Through stakeholder interviews, focus groups, and household surveys in three provinces of Vietnam with REDD+ activities, our research sought to understand if REDD+ policies and projects on the ground acknowledge that climate change is likely to impact forests and forest users; if this knowledge is built into REDD+ policy and activities; how households in forested areas subject to REDD+ policy are vulnerable to climate change; and how REDD+ activities can help or hinder needed adaptations. Our findings indicate that there continues to be a lack of coordination between mitigation and adaptation policies in Vietnam, particularly with regard to REDD+. Policies for forest-based climate mitigation at the national and subnational level, as well as site-based projects, have paid little attention to the adaptation needs of local communities, many of whom are already suffering from noticeable weather changes in their localities, and there is insufficient discussion of how REDD+ activities could facilitate increased resilience. While there were some implicit and coincidental adaptation benefits of some REDD+ activities, most studied projects and policies did not explicitly target their activities to focus on adaptation or resilience, and in at least one case, negative livelihood impacts that have increased household vulnerability to climate change were documented. Key barriers to integration were identified, such as sectoral specialization; a lack of attention in REDD+ projects to livelihoods; and inadequate support for ecosystem-based adaptation.",0.3085807424922758,0.4116020257861585,0.14891057685846312,0.3623597832531322,0.15296431489459475,0.09940691631996126,0.12687740327064148
Social capital and community preparation for urban flooding in China,"Social capital can enhance community resilience to environmental change. Productive and trusted relations among social actors and effectual social norms can help local residents share resources, information and risks. The main objective of our study is to understand the ways in which social attributes and risk considerations influence adoption of resilient economic measures by individuals for reducing potential losses due to catastrophic rainstorm and flooding. This article provides evidence from China on how social capital contributes to anticipatory adaptation to environmental change. The inquiry is based on structured interviews with local residents of Tianjin, a flood-prone port city in China, and a standard regression analysis. Findings show that the intention to make preparation increases with the levels of social expectation, social relationship, and institutional trust. Perceived risk and damage experience, however, have no significant impacts. This suggests that building social capacity and trust will be more effective in enhancing community resilience than merely increasing awareness of hazard risks. We call for greater efforts on strengthening the capacity of formal and informal communal institutions. The structural changes required, however, are challenging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Lessons from the Dzud: Community-Based Rangeland Management Increases the Adaptive Capacity of Mongolian Herders to Winter Disasters,"We investigated the role of formal community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) in responding and adapting to the 2009-10 winter weather disaster in Mongolia, by comparing herders' adaptation strategies and adaptive capacity in communities with and without formal CBNRM. Livestock mobility and forage and hay storage were the most important strategies for limiting livestock loss, but these depended on resource pooling and exchange strategies. CBNRM herders demonstrated greater adaptive capacity than non-CBNRM herders, due to greater knowledge exchange, information access, linking social capital, and proactive behavior. Social factors mediate and institutional constraints limit the implementation of adaptive strategies in Mongolia.

Overview of Impacts of Climate Change and Adaptation in China's Agriculture,"The purpose of this paper is to document the likely impacts of climate change on China's agriculture and the current adaptation efforts made by government and farmers. The review of literature shows that climate change will have a significant impact on agriculture, primarily through its effect on crop yields. The extent of predicted impacts highly depends on the crop, the CO2 fertilization effect assumption and adaptation abilities. Market response to the production shocks resulting from climate change will lessen the impacts on agricultural production predicted by natural scientists. On adaptation, the government's major efforts have been in the developing new technologies, reforming extension system and enhancing institutional capacity. Farmers do adapt to climate change, but their adaptation measures cannot fully offset the negative impacts of climate change. The paper concludes and makes implications for future studies.",0.8430035143440092,0.29169946936357494,0.0672918192250602,0.39640081837616503,0.0423334312636283,0.03902872426871862,0.046545673962537594
"Ecosystem services and livelihoods in a changing climate: Understanding local adaptations in the Upper Koshi, Nepal","Mountain ecosystems are increasingly being affected by global environmental change, challenging the ubiquitous agroecosystem-based livelihoods of the people. This article uses participatory research methods to document and analyse (1) local and regional impacts of climate change on ecosystem services (ES) and livelihoods, and (2) the main current adaptation strategies of local peoples in the mountains of central Nepal. Major observed impacts include reduced precipitation and an irregular rainfall pattern, affecting paddy cultivation and winter crop production. Production is also affected by increased pest and pathogen prevalence. Other impacts include increased livestock disease and reduced forest regeneration. Our results confirm earlier findings of a decrease in the district's forest cover in past; however, substantial efforts in forest conservation and management at the local level have gradually increased forest cover in recent years. Despite the increased potential for forest ecosystem services, the availability of forest goods, in particular fuel wood, fodder and litter, have decreased because of a strict regulation on forest goods extraction. Additionally, new invasive species are colonising these forests, preventing regeneration of preferred and local forest vegetation in some areas and, as a result, the densities of tree crops are changing. Most users cope with these changes by short term, reactive solutions. However, a number of local adaptation strategies, such as changing both agricultural practices and water harvesting and management, are increasing efficiency in resource use. To increase the adaptive capacity of poor households, we suggest it is essential to incorporate climate change adaptations within the local planning process. © 2015 The Author(s).

Is South Asian Agriculture Adapting to Climate Change? Evidence from the Indo-Gangetic Plains,"Despite growing scientific consensus that agriculture is affected by climate change and variability, there is still limited knowledge on how agricultural systems respond to climate risks under different circumstances. Drawing on three case studies conducted in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, covering Nepal, Bangladesh, and the Indian state of Punjab, this article analyzes agricultural adaptation practices to climate change. In particular, we examine how farmers and other agricultural actors understand and respond to climate change. We identify a variety of adaptation practices related to changes in cropping system, technological innovations, and institutional changes. We also explore key challenges related to such emerging adaptive innovation processes in the region.",0.8417009845060556,0.29121992498611377,0.14240200814991874,0.421507856540129,0.06527190326457968,0.023795097180126287,0.06429091997585692
Localising climate change: heatwave responses in urban households,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical insights into urban household perceptions and (in) action towards the perceived impacts of climate change, based on a case study in Kensington, Victoria, Australia. This case utilises households as sites of active agency, rather than as passive recipients of climate change or associated governance. Design/methodology/approach - This research trialled an approach to engaging a community in the context of disaster risk reduction (DRR). It involved a two-stage quantitative door-knocking survey (reported elsewhere), followed by a qualitative interview with interested households. In total, 76 quantitative surveys contextualise 15 qualitative interviews, which are the focus of this analysis. The findings are presented comparatively alongside the current literature. Findings - Heatwaves are understood to be the most concerning hazard for the households in this sample who associate their increasing frequency and severity with climate change. However, subsequent (in) action is shown to be situated within the complexities of day-to-day activities and concerns. While respondents did not consider themselves to have ""expert"" knowledge on climate change, or consider their actions to be a direct response to climate change, most had undertaken actions resulting from experience with heatwaves. These findings suggest there may be an under-representation of DRR, which includes climate change adaptation actions, within the existing research. Research limitations/implications - While this sample justifies the arguments and conclusions, it is not a representative sample and therefore requires follow-up. It does however challenge traditional approaches to risk management, which focus on awareness raising and education. The research highlights the unique contexts in which households perceive and act on risk, and the need for risk ""experts"" to consider such contexts. Originality/value - This research provides empirical evidence of urban household responses to perceived climate change-related risk, an often-neglected dimension of heatwave and adaptation studies in Australia. The findings also suggest promise for the methodological approach.",0.18522106622763662,0.3701960020337114,0.0926915938612786,0.2501999385162641,0.10623867525392561,0.23146296254513554,0.14072166050213958
Mainstreaming climate change adaptation in least developed countries in South and Southeast Asia,"This paper undertakes an in-depth analysis of six least developed countries (LDCs) in South and Southeast Asia to assess the extent of mainstreaming climate change adaptation into national development plans by reviewing their National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs), national development plans, and Strategic Programs for Climate Resilience (SPCRs) (where available). The paper proposes two perspectives to analyze the level of mainstreaming and five factors that may affect such a level. The results show that there is a significant difference in the success of their mainstreaming efforts: mainstreaming is relatively advanced in Bangladesh, limited in Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Maldives, and Nepal, and still minimal in Bhutan and Cambodia. Among the factors, the study finds that the inter-ministerial coordination supported by the highest levels of government is most relevant to the success of mainstreaming, which is measured by the integration of climate adaptation consideration into development priorities and a country's own initiatives, particularly those involving budget allocation. Recognition of the need for mainstreaming and monitoring and evaluation also affect the success of mainstreaming efforts in LDCs. Another important factor is to make adaptation plans compatible with national development plans in terms of their time horizon, and SPCRs effectively facilitate this process. As all countries still require external support for advancing mainstreaming, the role of development partners is instrumental. The paper points to issues that need to be incorporated in the relevant NAPAs including updating to facilitate mainstreaming.",0.22572888848942782,0.3483075484601898,0.14017859082079692,0.38979161636623283,0.1289668059275665,0.14934497388418547,0.183402133861735
"Cyclone, salinity intrusion and adaptation and coping measures in coastal Bangladesh","Although households in the coastal areas of Bangladesh undertake various adaptation and coping measures to minimise their vulnerability to cyclone hazards and salinity intrusion, these autonomous measures have received little attention in the past. However, the Government of Bangladesh has recently emphasised the importance of understanding these measures so that necessary interventions to make households more resilient to natural hazards and the adverse impacts of climate change can be introduced. This paper, based on secondary sources, explores adaptation and coping measures that households in the coastal areas of Bangladesh undertake to minimise their vulnerability to cyclone hazards and salinity intrusion. This paper shows that many of the adaptation and coping measures contribute to making households less vulnerable and more resilient to cyclone hazards and salinity intrusion, although some coping measures do the opposite as they reduce households' adaptive capacities instead of improving them. This paper argues that the adaptation and coping measures that contribute to reducing households' vulnerability to natural hazards need to be supported and guided by the government and NGOs to make them more effective. Additionally, measures that make households more vulnerable also need to be addressed by the government and NGOs, as most of these measures are related to and constrained by both poverty, and because the households have little or no access to economic opportunities. © Saha 2017.",0.4501184367701184,0.31544700192986075,0.07888885199712688,0.5487821207564124,0.29343532250244486,0.18218088152155146,0.2837131765456493
The Influence of Gender Relations on Women's Involvement and Experience in Climate Change Adaptation Programs in Bangladesh,"The nexus between poverty and climate change is a major concern, especially in a country like Bangladesh where lack of resources is a significant problem in both rural and urban areas. Climate change affects a wide demographic of the population in Bangladesh, and among those affected, women are more vulnerable to climate change impacts, as is evident from the history of climate-induced disasters in the country. Climate change increases women's socio-economic vulnerabilities by directly impacting their family's food security, water consumption, and livelihood. Hence, their roles and contributions are critical in responding through adaptation. Nonetheless, in Bangladesh, challenges remain to incorporate women as distinct actors and active agents in climate adaptation programs considering the gender power dynamics that exist. In this context, this study focuses on women's contributions as individuals or as a group and reveals their significant influence in climate change adaptation practices.",0.3521964481083938,0.3643851165914538,0.126608907653429,0.4832726507805126,0.0815502024186694,0.08531292073855377,0.23518702987243517
Improvement in irrigation water use efficiency: a strategy for climate change adaptation and sustainable development of Vietnamese tea production,"Irrigation is indispensable to overcome insufficient rainfall and to achieve a stabilized yield for tea production. As the severe scarcity of water resources because of climate change, water conservation through efficient irrigation has turned into a vital strategy for tea sector in solving this rising challenge. This paper analyzes irrigation water use efficiency of small-scale tea farms in Vietnam and identifies its determinants applying stochastic frontier analysis. Results showed that under decreasing returns to scale, the mean irrigation water use efficiency was 42.19 %, indicating the existence of substantial water waste. If farmers become more efficient in using water, saving 57.81 % of irrigation water is possible unaccompanied by reducing the observed output. The factors affecting tea farms' irrigation water use efficiency were investigated by Tobit model. Gender, water shortage awareness, soil and water conservation practice, off-farm income share, extension services access and well water utilization showed significant influence on the efficiency of irrigation water. The study' results provide insights to policymakers in implementing better water resource management amid climate change.",0.9022224828922166,0.1175525024776945,0.2209396142363295,0.1994032315245842,0.025265331156436942,0.05725764663891717,0.8144061193834935
"Farmers' perceptions, awareness, attitudes and adaption behaviour towards climate change","Using responses from a questionnaire survey conducted on a sample of 400 rice farmers from Kedah in Malaysia, this article examines rice farmers' perception, awareness, attitudes and adaptation behaviours towards mitigating climate change. The data collected was analysed using structural equation modelling. The findings of this study show that 84% of the respondents perceive a decrease in rainfall, while 75% perceive an increase in temperature over the last 10-15years due to climate change. The study also finds a significant and positive association between farmers' perception of climate change, awareness (AWN), attitudes (ATT) and adaptation behaviour (ADB). Furthermore, the results reveal that awareness and attitudes play a mediating role between perception and adaptation behaviour. The findings could be useful to public and private organizations in learning more about farmers' perceptions and adaptation behaviour in developing a policy framework to reduce adverse effects of climate change.",0.8441410217741838,0.288096812133135,0.09125436795352955,0.33106613441087507,0.03162520897014814,0.039952581861813156,0.04495961032208255
"Gendered Responses to Drought in Yunnan Province, China","Vulnerability to and perceptions of climate change may be significantly affected by gender. However, in China, gender is rarely addressed in climate adaption or resource management strategies. This paper demonstrates the relevance of gender in responses to climate change in the mountainous province of Yunnan in southwest China. Based on surveys undertaken during a record-breaking drought, the paper explores how women and men in a village in Baoshan Prefecture differ in their perceptions of and responses to drought, and how the changing roles of women and men in the home and the community are influencing water management at the village level. Our results show that despite the increasingly active role of women in managing water during the drought, they are excluded from community-level decision-making about water. The paper argues that given the importance of gender differences in perceptions of and responses to drought, the lack of a gender perspective in Chinese policy may undermine efforts to support local resource management and climate adaptation.",0.7321553370989697,0.3299023963407798,0.10607906293761661,0.3987153491016541,0.04819003102227441,0.042067180195274494,0.24481207537014882
"Assessment of the flood vulnerability of shrimp farms using a multicriteria evaluation and GIS: a case study in the Bangpakong Sub-Basin, Thailand","Flood disasters associated with tropical storms have caused extensive and repeated damage to shrimp farms located in the Bangpakong River Basin, Chachoengsao Province, Thailand, which features the largest area of inland shrimp farming in the country. This study aims to assess the current vulnerability of shrimp farms to flooding and to examine the shrimp farmers' actual adaptation practices for coping with floods based on past flood events. A flood vulnerability map was developed based on the geoenvironmental characteristics of the study area. The map was produced through the use of geographic information system methods and a multicriteria evaluation. The current vulnerability map indicates that the majority of shrimp farms in the Bangpakong River Basin are highly vulnerable to flooding when the 10-day cumulative rainfall is [250-300 mm. The highly vulnerable area identified by the map is consistent with the area impacted by flooding in 2011. Based on a questionnaire, the majority of shrimp farmers have developed various adaptation practices to cope with flooding. The most common practice for minimizing flood damage is to increase the height of dikes around shrimp ponds. Because of budgetary constraints, approximately 20 % of small-scale shrimp farmers did not implement any adaptation practices and risked potential damage. With increasing climate change threats, these research results are useful for planning and creating policies that can reduce flood damage to shrimp farms in vulnerable zones. The results can also be applied to other areas facing similar conditions.",0.6918496109433021,0.26138166148263725,0.15738142754451503,0.29641338642907444,0.1054779027504259,0.1209712783985785,0.26914085837172597
Vulnerability of the Tibetan Pastoral Systems to Climate and Global Change,"The impacts of climate and global change on Tibetan pastoral systems have become increasingly evident. Thus, a significant research endeavor is to explore the combined effects of these changes on the livelihoods of herder households and communities, on the adaptation strategies they adopted to respond to the current and expected risks associated with these changes, and on the emerging opportunities that can strengthen their resilience and adaptive capacity. We performed an integrated analysis of the dynamics of Tibetan pastoral systems influenced by climate and global changes by using the analytical framework developed by Ostrom. Climate and global changes have significantly altered the attributes of and the interactions within Tibetan pastoral systems, thus posing great challenges to their sustainable development. We used Nagqu County, a remote area of the northern Tibetan Plateau of China, as a case study to analyze the adaptation strategies adopted by local herders to respond to multiple stressors, as well as the emerging opportunities that they can take advantage of to increase their adaptive capacity. Findings show that although local herders have developed various adaptation strategies, such as planting forage grass, buying fodder from the market, renting pastures, joining formal or informal cooperatives, and diversifying livelihoods, social, cultural, and institutional challenges still exist. To enhance the adaptive capacity of herders and to reduce their vulnerability, we recommend that future rangeland policies and programs promote: (1) comprehensive support for formal or informal pastoral cooperatives, (2) development of the rangeland economy to take advantage of the multifunctionalities of rangeland ecosystems, and (3) revitalization of the mobility paradigm to allow the flexible use of rangelands.",0.7783522321908168,0.3381028564461657,0.14808457335947128,0.5194877416401565,0.07996994297285426,0.03099610630407258,0.0529661268259071
"Impacts of climatic variability on agriculture and options for adaptation in the Surma River basin, Bangladesh","The objectives of this study are to explore the impacts of climatic variability on agriculture and to find out the viable options for adaptation to the changing climate. The primary data are collected through a questionnaire survey, key informant interviews and field observations in two agriculture-based villages of the Surma River basin. A household-level structured questionnaire survey was conducted on 260 households selected from 746 through simple random sampling. The study first explored the impacts of climatic variability on agriculture and fishery. Then, the existing adaptation measures undertaken by the farmer to combat the adverse impacts of climatic variability were identified. It was found that climatic variability adversely affects the crop production, crop diversity and cropping pattern in the study area. It hampers production rate, cultivation area, soil productivity and the mode of irrigation of an agricultural system of an area. Similarly, inauspicious climatic events also destroy the fishery and livestock sectors. In addition, the socioeconomic circumstances of farmers are also being influenced by climatic change. Hence, farmers are adopting feasible adaptation measures to cope with and adapt to the adverse and changing climatic events. The present study explored a number of indigenous and modern adaptation measures undertaken by the farmers.",0.9572412485525035,0.21290224576527536,0.11303980659955606,0.5,0.029094180363208263,0.017123637503047982,0.05215383805465516
"Engaging stakeholders in an adaptation process: governance and institutional arrangements in heat-health policy development in Adelaide, Australia","Record breaking heat waves have been recorded in Adelaide, Australia in recent years and climate change would likely increase the frequency, duration and severity of heat waves. This paper describes the governance and institutional arrangements during the development of an adaptation strategy (herein referred to as heat-health policy) for heat waves in Adelaide, Australia. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted between June and August 2011 among 18 stakeholders who were involved in the participatory process during the development of the heat-health policy. Informed consent was obtained and interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and the data analysed using framework analysis. Interview data were supplemented by data gathered through a review of documents associated with the process. The results found that the process of developing the heat-health policy was initiated by the state government and comprised of stakeholders from both the state and non-state sectors. There was a high level of leadership and political commitment demonstrated during the process, given that the different players wanted a policy to be in place before any future heat wave. A Steering Committee was established that provided coordination and oversight in addition to the Emergency Management Act within the state which provided the legislative framework during the heat-health policy development process. Although the decision-making authority was controlled by a controlled by a public institution, to a larger extent, there was collaborative decision-making by virtue of the context in which the heat-health policy was developed. An assurance mechanism established during the process was among the factors that ensured accountability during the participatory process. Overall, the development of the heat-health policy in Adelaide was largely successful, attributed to the extent of political commitment from the state government and the sound institutional and legislative framework that facilitated the process. Good governance and institutional arrangements provide the enabling environment, the structures, systems and resources that would facilitate the development of adaptation strategies such as heat-health policies.",0.08175574867106461,0.5849710459615354,0.05725156329263696,0.21448336130223913,0.04992668316550252,0.3622867831460459,0.04910089326623985
Are We There Yet? NSW local governments' progress on climate change,"Local governments are responding to top-down policy initiatives from both federal and State governments to reduce emissions, and adapt to any potential impacts of climate change. Although climate change is clearly a global problem, many of the solutions will be implemented at the local level. To explore this issue, the aim of this research was to examine regional variation in climate change response across New South Wales (NSW). To this end, between September 2010 and September 2011, we reviewed publicly available council and regional documentations for all NSW councils. The indicators of response examined were based on the NSW Greenhouse Plan (2005). These were awareness-raising, emissions reduction and adaptation planning. It was found that councils were undertaking many practical projects to fulfil the goals of this plan. As a result, they are abating significant quantities of emissions. Adaptation is progressing through the development of risk-based climate change adaptation plans. Councils are addressing particular areas of management, such as water management, assisted by guidelines which incorporate consideration for climate change as part of best practice. While overall responses to this threat are progressing, a distinct urban bias in action has been observed, due to biases in policy and funding arrangements.",0.26411759497226855,0.3396808892894336,0.1441496373138787,0.2056512334411642,0.09171094895259631,0.3277354904375113,0.09911046069685855
Perceived Self-Efficacy and Adaptation to Climate Change in Coastal Cambodia,"In response to climate change at different spatial scales, adaptation has become one of the focal points of current research and policy developments. In the context of coastal Cambodia, there is little research on local level adaptation to climate change. Using ordinal logistic and logistic regression analyses, this study examines the relationship between perceived self-efficacy and anticipatory and reactive adaptation to climate change among 1823 households in coastal communities in Cambodia. Findings indicate that individuals who reported higher categories of self-efficacy were more likely to report both anticipatory (OR = 1.74, p < 0.001) and reactive adaptation (OR = 3.61, p < 0.001) measures. Similary, tndividuals who had higher education had higher odds of reporting anticipatory adaptation (OR = 1.71, p < 0.001) and reactive adaptation (OR = 1.63, p < 0.05) when compared with those without formal education. Participants who have been living in their current residence for six years or more were more likely to report anticipatory adaptation (OR = 1.09, p < 0.05) and reactive adapation (OR = 1.22, p < 0.001) compared with those who had lived there for a shorter duration of time. Region of residence was positively associated with both anticipatory and reactive adaptation. In this context, it is important to note that individuals in the most agriculture-dependent and climate sensitive province reported the least anticipatory and reactive adaptation measures. Policy makers should target empowerment of the most vulnerable population to facilitate better adaptation behavior, and mainstreaming of knowledge on climate change adaptation through both formal and informal education at the community level.",0.3582958568455872,0.3647409262533709,0.058773176452089466,0.26538651060344093,0.11779660587508153,0.15566815852952162,0.07846140566429914
Assessment of risk premium in farm technology adoption as a climate change adaptation strategy in the dryland systems of India,"Purpose - Changing climate has increasingly become a challenge for smallholder farmers. Identification of technical, institutional and policy interventions as coping and adaptation strategies and exploring risks of their adoption for smallholder farms are the important areas to consider. The aim of the present study was to carry out an in-depth analysis of adaptation strategies followed and the associated risk premium in technology adoption. Design/methodology/approach - The study was carried out in the dryland systems of three Indian states - Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan - and was based on a survey of 1,019 households in 2013. The flexible moment-based approach was used for estimating the stochastic production function, which allowed estimation of the relative risk premium that farmers are willing to pay while adopting the technologies to avoid crop production risks. Findings - In all the three states, the risk premium (INR ha(-1)) was higher for farm mechanization compared to supplemental irrigation, except in the case of Andhra Pradesh. The higher the level of technology adoption, the higher the risk premium that households have to pay. This can be estimated by the higher investment needed to build infrastructure for farm mechanization and supplemental irrigation in the regions. The key determinants of technology adoption in the context of smallholder farmers were climatic shocks, investment in farm infrastructure, location of the farm, farm size, household health status, level of education, married years, expected profit and livestock ownership. Originality/value - Quantification of the risk premium in technology adoption and conducting associated awareness programs for farmers and decision-makers are important to strengthen evidence-based adoption decisions in the dryland systems of India.",0.9357407709464293,0.21703558035541587,0.06416519549079754,0.5272655405860811,0.018056664314035367,0.0276459692128541,0.027866890057041308
Taking stock of community-based climate-change adaptation projects in the Pacific,"A number of international donors have in recent years shown great interest in implementing community-based projects related to adaptation to climate change climate- in the Pacific. This interest has seen a flurry of activity in Pacific communities to develop and implement on-ground activities in the hope of enhancing adaptive capacity. This article draws on the results of a questionnaire completed by 31 agencies that have implemented climate-change adaptation projects in various communities throughout the Pacific region. The impetus for this research is to better understand the types of projects that have been implemented, and assess their levels of success in safeguarding communities in the face of climate change. While there has been limited overall progress made across the region to address climate change impacts at the community level, four broad-brush lessons that relate to the process of project development and implementation are drawn from this research. These lessons include the need to: provide locally and culturally appropriate community awareness and education; integrate local environmental knowledge throughout the project cycle; ensure that community ownership is involved in all project stages; and enhance sustainable livelihood resources more broadly.",0.3316999285577137,0.4202985454693216,0.19925116905741805,0.3826037527276098,0.2799682575229965,0.12640286260604494,0.4882892983546536
Empowering young people and strengthening resilience: youth-centred participatory video as a tool for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction,"Young people regularly face great hurdles to get their voices heard, while research and practice in the disaster and climate change community commonly represent young people as passive victims requiring protection. Consequently, their capacities to inform decision-making processes, communicate risks to their communities and take direct action to reduce risks have been neglected. This paper presents empirical data from participatory video (PV) methods with groups of young people in three communities in Eastern Samar, the Philippines. Producing these videos enabled groups to research, document and raise awareness of disaster risk, and use screening events to mobilise and advocate for risk reduction measures in their communities. The results suggest that the PV process was an effective tool for empowering young people to raise important issues with decision-makers and advocate change on behalf of their communities.",0.3539755669287976,0.40560327705038657,0.09203112263561916,0.27309418952298475,0.13093312139235924,0.1781017025589578,0.10057671597978454
Planning for the past: Local temporality and the construction of denial in climate change adaptation,"Climate change is upon us. While debates continue over how to mitigate emissions, it is evident that many parts of the world will need to adapt to an increasingly unstable climate. However, the persistence of climate denial presents a significant barrier to climate change response; if a future in which the climate has dramatically changed cannot be imagined, there is little motivation to act. Using qualitative interview data, our research investigates community responses to climate change adaptation planning in a coastal region of Australia identified as highly vulnerable to future sea level rise. While the local council engaged in extensive consultation to develop an adaptation plan, community opposition to proposed development changes ultimately resulted in a 'wait and see' response. We show how the community's local understandings of place informed temporalities that led to a practice of climate denial. We outline three processes by which climate denial is socially organised: anchoring the past via historical reference; projecting continuity through a nostalgic lens of managing disaster; and enclosing the present by prioritising existing economic value. We show how these processes result in the social organisation of climate denial, and an inability to plan for a climate changed future.",0.18253475314057677,0.39944060845499213,0.11955007229930331,0.2788163703727684,0.166444127547543,0.2192542277622686,0.11170367714911872
Do You See What I See? Rural Landholders' Belief in Climate Change,"Southeastern Australia is at the cutting edge of climate change, with predicted warming, drying, and increased variability expected to affect rural livelihoods. Some are optimistic about rural landholders' ability to adjust because of their history of coping with climatic extremes. Others see a conservative rural population more skeptical of climate change than the general public and more likely to resist making necessary changes. These contradictory portrayals, largely unresolved in research and policy circles, provided the focus of our research. We examine links between rural landholders' knowledge, beliefs, and risk perceptions and their adaptations to climate change. We found most rural landholders in our case studies were not climate change deniers and were adapting tactically to drier conditions. Low levels of climate change knowledge were an important influence on adaptation, and mistrust in climate change science confirms the need for particular strategies to effectively engage rural landholders in constructive dialogues.",0.6753957039209852,0.3188608048424317,0.1231038983657752,0.3633797256084928,0.04924716662727387,0.05824660877123472,0.11818540240509202
Farmers' perceptions of climate change and the proposed agriculture adaptation strategies in a semi arid region of south India,"Climate change is recognised as one of the leading challenges affecting the performance of agriculture and the livelihood of people. Farmers are the hardest hit as they have to continuously respond to climatic variations. In order to understand farmers' perceptions of climate change and its impacts, and to identify adaptation needs, focus group discussions and semi-structured questionnaire surveys were carried out at the end of the south-west monsoon season in 2012 (Kharif cropping season in India). This helped to gather their immediate responses soon after the poor performance of south-west monsoon 2012. Khariff cultivation is locally known as 'Kuruvai' and is always under the influence of the south-west monsoon rainfall. Farmers' have perceived climate variability, and identified increasing temperature, delayed onset, intermittent dry spells and decreasing soil moisture as the critical factors affecting their cultivation. Some of them have started to adapt to these changes by cultivating only short-duration crops such as pulses, vegetables and flowers especially jasmine, but there is also a trend to put more land under fallow and abandoning the major cereal production. This study reveals that the farmers' perceptions are in accordance with the real trends analysis done on meteorological variables using Mann-Kendall test and Sens's slope estimator test, but not exactly matches with rainfall. Farmers have indicated their specific adaptation needs, a number of which could be incorporated into site-specific adaption strategies and policies.",0.9539419695759512,0.19549925524819894,0.0737938819410011,0.5301906662438453,0.018343757784652366,0.019993026948673543,0.048562439761163166
"Resilience and shifts in agro-ecosystems facing increasing sea-level rise and salinity intrusion in Ben Tre Province, Mekong Delta","Coastal areas of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam are increasingly experiencing salinity intrusion in freshwater systems, in part due to climate change induced sea-level rise, compromising agricultural production and domestic water supply. In order to determine which development trajectories could result in resilient agro-ecosystems, a study area in Thanh Phu district, Ben Tre province was selected where the influence of salinity intrusion on agro-ecosystem can be studied along spatial and temporal salinity gradients. The district is divided in three sub-regions: sub-region 3, closest to the coastline, is principally dedicated to brackish-water shrimp farming; more inland, sub-region 2 has a mix of rice-shrimp farming; and further inland, sub-region 1, which is protected from salinity intrusion by a system of dykes, is dedicated principally to rice farming. Household and expert interviews, focus group discussions and a review of policy documents were used to capture historical salinity problems as well as shifts in farming systems. Agricultural activities have changed in the last decades, mainly driven by national-level policies. At present, the development of engineered infrastructures is favoured whereas complementary or alternative solutions to increase the resilience of social-ecological systems with respect to salinity intrusion exist. These include regeneration of coastal ecosystems, agronomic measures, upstream flow control and shifts in agro-ecosystems. The latter would increasingly enable farmers to work under the influence of both saline and freshwater systems allowing income diversification. National authorities have an opportunity to change the business as usual mode of tackling water-related problems including extreme events in the Mekong Delta through infrastructure development by looking at these alternative solutions.",0.774313274932719,0.21932823319982406,0.17077298483772263,0.32298178527291677,0.37277736885285423,0.08235061772639912,0.1976383324337065
Local knowledge and adaptation to climate change in natural resource-based societies of the Asia-Pacific,"This paper reviewed 42 studies of how local knowledge contributes to adaptation to climate and climate change in the Asia-Pacific Region. Most studies focused on traditional ecological or indigenous knowledge. Three simple questions were addressed: (1) How are changes in climate recognized? (2) What is known about how to adapt to changes in climate? (3) How do people learn about how to adapt? Awareness of change is an important element of local knowledge. Changes in climate are recognized at multiple time scales from observations that warn of imminent extreme weather through expectations for the next season to identification of multi-year historical trends. Observations are made of climate, its impact on physical resources, and bio-indicators. Local knowledge about how to adapt can be divided into four major classes: land and water management, physical infrastructure, livelihood strategies, and social institutions. Adaptation actions vary with time scale of interest from dealing with risks of disaster from extreme weather events, through slow onset changes such as seasonal droughts, to dealing with long-term multi-year shifts in climate. Local knowledge systems differ in the capacities and ways in which they support learning. Many are dynamic and draw on information from other places, whereas others are more conservative and tightly institutionalized. Past experience of events and ways of learning may be insufficient for dealing with a novel climate. Once the strengths and limitations of local knowledge (like those of science) are grasped the opportunities for meaningful hybridization of scientific and local knowledge for adaptation expand.",0.533809717367251,0.45869351779323264,0.1443883506345788,0.3050528254285268,0.08781001931880776,0.06564085881283602,0.298131559932144
Can Strategies to Cope with Hazard Shocks be Explained by At-Risk Households' Socioeconomic Asset Profile? Evidence from Tropical Cyclone-Prone Coastal Bangladesh,"This article documents the results of an empirical investigation on the complex interplay between diverse coping mechanisms and the socioeconomic asset profiles of coastal households at risk. Focusing on household-level perceptions and responses to cyclone hazards, a case study was carried out in a poor area in Bangladesh that is prone to natural hazards. We developed and tested our own analytical models based on the asset approach. We conducted a face-to-face household survey in southwestern coastal Bangladesh, in the Koyra sub-district, in late 2009. We asked 360 households affected by the May 2009 tropical Cyclone Aila about their hazard perceptions, preparedness, coping practices, and socioeconomic assets. The results suggest that the majority of households at risk perceive an increasing trend of different climate hazards, with a distinct dominance of tropical cyclones, storm surges, and flash floods in the study area, which resulted in a yearly average economic damage of USD 144 for each household in the first year after Aila. However, such damage is significantly and inversely correlated with the number of adopted coping practices. Significant and systematic differences exist between upstream and downstream households in the study area with respect to hazard perception, hazard induced damages, asset accessibility, and adopted diversified coping practices. The empirical findings suggest that the degree of adoption of coping practices depends primarily on elements of socioeconomic asset profile and the duration of the consequences of cyclone hazards. Disaster preparedness training seems to improve at-risk households' degree of information access and eventually leads them to adopt more coping practices to reduce adverse impacts of climate hazards. Area-specific practical modules on coping practices should be incorporated in curricula of disaster preparedness training to make people at risk more resilient to hazard shocks.",0.4157752238244728,0.3618148159175188,0.060747012514243595,0.4945683366708352,0.1449988362921763,0.1634246562981594,0.22324785839169717
"Interpretation of Climate Change and Agricultural Adaptations by Local Household Farmers: a Case Study at Bin County, Northeast China","Although climate change impacts and agricultural adaptations have been studied extensively, how smallholder farmers perceive climate change and adapt their agricultural activities is poorly understood. Survey-based data (presents farmers' personal perceptions and adaptations to climate change) associated with external biophysical-socioeconomic data (presents real-world climate change) were used to develop a farmer-centered framework to explore climate change impacts and agricultural adaptations at a local level. A case study at Bin County (1980s-2010s), Northeast China, suggested that increased annual average temperature (0.6 degrees C per decade) and decreased annual precipitation (46 mm per decade, both from meteorological datasets) were correctly perceived by 76 and 66.9%, respectively, of farmers from the survey, and that a longer growing season was confirmed by 70% of them. These reasonably correct perceptions enabled local farmers to make appropriate adaptations to cope with climate change: Longer season alternative varieties were found for maize and rice, which led to a significant yield increase for both crops. The longer season also affected crop choice: More farmers selected maize instead of soybean, as implicated from survey results by a large increase in the maize growing area. Comparing warming-related factors, we found that precipitation and agricultural disasters were the least likely causes for farmers' agricultural decisions. As a result, crop and variety selection, rather than disaster prevention and infrastructure improvement, was the most common ways for farmers to adapt to the notable warming trend in the study region.",0.9829698091373693,0.2070156695184961,0.08239469827671753,0.45828076740216755,0.02220751520246489,0.015112099372304781,0.030895586928412197
Vulnerability in north-central Vietnam: do natural hazards matter for everybody?,"This article examines changes in livelihood strategies in response to flooding. It does soon the basis of a household survey which was undertaken in three provinces in north-central Vietnam. All households in the survey were regularly affected by flooding, but only poor households experienced long-term negative effects. The research showed that a high impact of natural disasters is correlated with decreases in income over time. As the disaster relief offered by the authorities is marginal compared to economic losses, some households react by increasing off-farm incomes (including remittances from overseas-migrated household members). We observed that the poor households do not switch to off-farm income strategies in response to income losses; this is perhaps because they have inadequate skills. However, on average households in our survey are becoming richer over time, despite the impact of flooding in the provinces. The article ends by looking at the vulnerability-resilience debate concluding that the poorer households could enter a vulnerability loop, unless new strategies to cope with natural hazards are suggested.",0.6420442733856083,0.29361760758536176,0.07512193908897068,0.6478937859329724,0.07922260440043234,0.08447690104040469,0.15482570981136085
"Dynamics of communal land degradation and its implications in the arid mountains of pakistan: A study of District Karak, Khyber Pakhtunkuwa","Similar to other areas of Pakistan, land resources in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) is kept under various ownership regimes for socio-economic and ecological benefits. For the last three to four decades, communal lands and resources are subjected to high rate of degradation and deterioration, which is leading to multifarious socio-economical and ecological implications. This paper intends to look into factors that are responsible for the degradation of communal land and the adaptability of the management mechanisms developed by the local inhabitants to conserve these resources. Moreover, this study also explores the sustainability of these adopted strategies in present circumstances. Data regarding socio-economic parameters of the inhabitants and their interactions with communal lands were collected through questionnaire cum interview method. As long-term climatic data for the area do not exist therefore focus group discussions were conducted to document the changing trend in rainfall regimes and temperature variations for the last about four decades. Results indicate that communal lands are highly vulnerable to degradation due to biophysical and anthropogenic factors. Local inhabitants have developed suitable measures to control the situation, however, accelerated socioeconomic transformations in the area have weakened the role of local institutions and that led to further degradation of these resources. Nevertheless, a number of locally formulated rules have been revived and implemented and it is hoped that these threatened resources would be conserved.",0.5775020967262708,0.32056242758493225,0.14746756955910975,0.48963982674149675,0.0817888236827444,0.07019799109972265,0.13507704931614942
Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) practices in smallholder agriculture; emerging evidence from rural Pakistan,"Ecosystems and biodiversity provide many critical life support functions including clean water, food, climate regulation, and recreational services. Despite its significant values biodiversity in Pakistan is being lost at a significant rate particularly due to agriculture intensification. The intensive agriculture system leading to serious environmental damages including biodiversity loss, water pollution, soil degradation, disruption of carbon sink and increase in GHG emissions. There is a growing recognition of promoting Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) strategies in smallholder agriculture; however, there is limited information about the existing EbA strategies by smallholder farmers and factors that influence the adoption of these practices. This article addresses research gap by using a survey data of 360 households from three districts of Pakistan. We explored existing EbA practices used by farmers and factors associated with the use of these practices. The list of ecosystem-based adaptation practices (EbA) was created on the basis of literature review and with the assistance of expert opinions. This study identified a number of risks associated with ecosystem degradation as perceived by smallholder farmers such as salinization, water pollution, soil erosion and decline in crop productivity. Due to over exploitation of underground water and extensive use of external inputs for agriculture use, the majority of farmers reported decline in water quality and depth of the underground water table. We used a double hurdle model for adoption and intensity of adaptation practices. The results show that farmers' social capital and institutional access increase the probability and intensity of adoption of EbA practices. The study suggests that a majority of smallholder farmers in Pakistan are already using certain EbA strategies, but there is still scope for larger implementation. Institutional policies and non-government organizations (NGOs) can increase broader use of EbA strategies by facilitating farmers' access to subsidized tree nurseries, farmer-to-farmer information and promoting EbA policies in different socioeconomic and agro-ecological context.

The diversity of gendered adaptation strategies to climate change of Indian farmers: A feminist intersectional approach,"This paper examines climate change adaptation and gender issues through an application of a feminist intersectional approach. This approach permits the identification of diverse adaptation responses arising from the existence of multiple and fragmented dimensions of identity (including gender) that intersect with power relations to shape situation-specific interactions between farmers and ecosystems. Based on results from contrasting research cases in Bihar and Uttarakhand, India, this paper demonstrates, inter alia, that there are geographically determined gendered preferences and adoption strategies regarding adaptation options and that these are influenced by the socio-ecological context and institutional dynamics. Intersecting identities, such as caste, wealth, age and gender, influence decisions and reveal power dynamics and negotiation within the household and the community, as well as barriers to adaptation among groups. Overall, the findings suggest that a feminist intersectional approach does appear to be useful and worth further exploration in the context of climate change adaptation. In particular, future research could benefit from more emphasis on a nuanced analysis of the intra-gender differences that shape adaptive capacity to climate change.",0.5971440166203278,0.38956063373484934,0.14998761813864686,0.5,0.11181378008107277,0.05699530684129044,0.13742532425135906

"Associations between risk perception, spontaneous adaptation behavior to heat waves and heatstroke in Guangdong province, China","Background: In many parts of the world, including in China, extreme heat events or heat waves are likely to increase in intensity, frequency, and duration in light of climate change in the next decades. Risk perception and adaptation behaviors are two important components in reducing the health impacts of heat waves, but little is known about their relationships in China. This study aimed to examine the associations between risk perception to heat waves, adaptation behaviors, and heatstroke among the public in Guangdong province, China. Methods: A total of 2,183 adult participants were selected using a four-stage sampling method in Guangdong province. From September to November of 2010 each subject was interviewed at home by a well-trained investigator using a structured questionnaire. The information collected included socio-demographic characteristics, risk perception and spontaneous adaptation behaviors during heat wave periods, and heatstroke experience in the last year. Chi-square tests and unconditional logistic regression models were employed to analyze the data. Results: This study found that 14.8%, 65.3% and 19.9% of participants perceived heat waves as a low, moderate or high health risk, respectively. About 99.1% participants employed at least one spontaneous adaptation behavior, and 26.2%, 51.2% and 22.6% respondents employed <4, 4-7, and >7 adaptation behaviors during heat waves, respectively. Individuals with moderate (OR=2.93, 95% CI: 1.38-6.22) or high (OR=10.58, 95% CI: 4.74-23.63) risk perception experienced more heatstroke in the past year than others. Drinking more water and wearing light clothes in urban areas, while decreasing activity as well as wearing light clothes in rural areas were negatively associated with heatstroke. Individuals with high risk perception and employing < 4 adaptation behaviors during heat waves had the highest risks of heatstroke (OR=47.46, 95% CI: 12.82-175.73). Conclusions: There is a large room for improving health risk perception and adaptation capacity to heat waves among the public of Guangdong province. People with higher risk perception and fewer adaptation behaviors during heat waves may be more vulnerable to heat waves.",0.24404073101617407,0.4559662396801219,0.04853563716476405,0.1518667762425983,0.032381634251878545,0.40914133748154224,0.03022465020572565
"Local Farmers' Perceptions of Climate Change and Local Adaptive Strategies: A Case Study from the Middle Yarlung Zangbo River Valley, Tibet, China","Climate change affects the productivity of agricultural ecosystems. Farmers cope with climate change based on their perceptions of changing climate patterns. Using a case study from the Middle Yarlung Zangbo River Valley, we present a new research framework that uses questionnaire and interview methods to compare local farmers' perceptions of climate change with the adaptive farming strategies they adopt. Most farmers in the valley believed that temperatures had increased in the last 30 years but did not note any changes in precipitation. Most farmers also reported sowing and harvesting hulless barley 10-15 days earlier than they were 20 years ago. In addition, farmers observed that plants were flowering and river ice was melting earlier in the season, but they did not perceive changes in plant germination, herbaceous vegetation growth, or other spring seasonal events. Most farmers noticed an extended fall season signified by delays in the freezing of rivers and an extended growing season for grassland vegetation. The study results showed that agricultural practices in the study area are still traditional; that is, local farmers' perceptions of climate change and their strategies to mitigate its impacts were based on indigenous knowledge and their own experiences. Adaptive strategies included adjusting planting and harvesting dates, changing crop species, and improving irrigation infrastructure. However, the farmers' decisions could not be fully attributed to their concerns about climate change. Local farming systems exhibit high adaptability to climate variability. Additionally, off-farm income has reduced the dependence of the farmers on agriculture, and an agricultural subsidy from the Chinese Central Government has mitigated the farmers' vulnerability. Nevertheless, it remains necessary for local farmers to build a system of adaptive climate change strategies that combines traditional experience and indigenous knowledge with scientific research and government polices as key factors.",0.9926581919715654,0.19666646288498812,0.09739153177920605,0.5417421845992256,0.019803620016267943,0.006909157238521408,0.0331114357681667
"Limits to autonomous adaptation in response to coastal erosion in Kosrae, Micronesia","Small-island developing states (SIDS) are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, sea level rise and extreme weather events. Sea-level rise is expected to exacerbate coastal erosion. Adaptation measures in response to this in SIDS have the potential to reduce some of the adverse impacts, yet they have limitations. This article addresses the degree to which households on the island of Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), are affected by coastal erosion, the autonomous adaptation measures they have implemented, the limitations thereof, and the loss and damage incurred as a result. This analysis is based on quantitative and qualitative data. We found that 70% of the 363 households we interviewed experienced adverse effects of coastal erosion. Of those suffering from impacts, 60% carried out adaptation measures. Yet, 92% of those respondents who carried out adaptation measures indicated that these measures were insufficient, resulting in loss and damage to livelihoods, housing and culture. This empirical case study contributes to the critical debate on the impacts of climate change beyond adaptation.",0.29777463940323895,0.3866466561950445,0.11128979733427347,0.3001551959023896,0.3999820012643187,0.4393711791355163,0.3293571891803598
Cultural adaptation to climate change among indigenous people of South India,"The mainstream discourses on global climate change have tended to focus on mitigation and have neglected the adaptive measures, particularly at the local level, even though the local/indigenous people have been considered to be more vulnerable to such change. However, climate change has a distinct local reality-since the way such change is perceived and addressed is linked with the local people and their practices. Although climate change largely affects the lives of the local poor, certain positive effects may also occur for those marginalized people. In other words, many of the indigenous peoples have an adaptive capacity to deal with climate change. Therefore, climate change adaptation has now increasingly gained prominence. In this context, this paper will investigate the impact of climate change at the local level and explain how an indigenous and vulnerable population, the Konda Reddis, respond to such change through cultural adaptation. The paper will focus on the cultural significance of the jeelugu (fishtail palm, Caryota urens) and Konda Reddis' shift from the jeelugu to the tati (palmyra palm, Borassus flabellifera). I will argue that such a shift is an indication of an adaptation to climate change. I will also maintain that though climate change plays a dominant role in stimulating such adaptation, certain other factors also interact with climatic factors in the adaptation.",0.4165233382364866,0.3901332405749341,0.11677390276735944,0.283584619390267,0.09680796459220284,0.12841233821764286,0.09982524304037137
How adjustments in land use patterns contribute to drought risk adaptation in a changing climate-A case study in China,"In the context of climate change, adaptation to climatic extremes, such as drought, has attracted worldwide attention, yet many practical adaptation strategies need to be examined at the local level. Based on a case study of the village of Beidian, located in a drought-prone region in northern China, this study demonstrates that when faced with multiple pressures of regional climate change, drought risk and rural poverty, reasonable adjustments in land use patterns can serve as an effective adaptation strategy in the agricultural sector. We used household questionnaires, in-depth interviews with village managers, and land use surveys at the farming plot level to quantify the relationship between land use change and drought mitigation effects. Our findings indicate that in the past decade, the farming practices in Beidian have transformed from a complete reliance on the winter wheat-summer corn rotation to a new diversified mode of apple as the main crop and corn and coarse cereals as the subsidiary crops. The current farming mode is proven to possess a stronger adaptive capacity to drought due to its higher water-saving efficiency and economic benefit, which facilitates rural poverty reduction and socio-economic development. This study presents a feasible approach to address adaptation strategies at the local level, which provides policymakers with information on how to best support farm-level adaptation and to reduce farmers' vulnerability to climatic extremes within the broader context of climate change.

Farmers' initiative on adaptation to climate change in the Northern Agro-pastoral Ecotone,"Adaptation to climate change is an inevitable choice for human society. Farmers' perceptions and responses to climate change are key factors in coping with climate change to promote sustainable agricultural development. The Northern Agro-pastoral Ecotone, an ecologically fragile transition zone, has experienced a warm-drought trend, which has affected agricultural production greatly in recent decades. Using semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey about the farmers' perceptions on warm-drought climate change and their adaptation measures in the central part of the Northern Agro-pastoral Ecotone, we found that almost 100% of the farmers perceived the warm drought and its impacts, not only on agricultural production, but also on rural labor. Farmers adapted to the warm drought mainly by adjusting crop varieties and planting dates, utilizing water conservation and irrigation technologies. Delaying sowing time, introducing drought-resistant seeds, mulching, and irrigating were the most effective ways in which farmers adapted to the changing climate. In accordance with these findings, some strategies for adaptation are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Deconstructing vulnerability and adaptation in a coastal river basin ecosystem: a participatory analysis of flood risk in Nadi, Fiji Islands","Despite the growing discussion on vulnerability and adaptation in urban areas, there is limited research on how smaller towns and cities in Small Island Developing States are being affected by and responding to climate change impacts. This study uses fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM), field visits and semi-structured interviews with 40 stakeholders across 6 different stakeholder groups in the Nadi River Basin, Fiji Islands to identify, analyse and deconstruct climate change vulnerability and adaptation options to manage increasing flood risks. The research evidence suggests that vulnerability to floods in the basin is on the rise due to a complex mesh of three intersecting factors. Firstly, non-climatic pressures such as development, drainage, social change, agriculture, tourism growth and deforestation combine, juxtapose and interact in a rather unique way with global climate variability (interdependent systems) to increase the stress on the river and coastal ecosystems. Secondly, the most vulnerable or at-risk populations like the farmers, squatter households and in particular women within the community have weak coping capacity due to a combination of demographic and social characteristics. Thirdly, vulnerability is on the rise due to climate factors as well as the flurry of unplanned development, redevelopment and degradation of catchment resources. The research findings have implications for adaptation policies. In particular, the basin stakeholders should integrate climate change within sectorial planning processes, actively engage the vulnerable groups, promote knowledge, awareness and social learning, and invest in adaptive management across all levels of decision-making. Structural policy changes to land-use planning and insurance financing schemes are also necessary to address growing risks. These have the potential to enhance local capacities of communities to adapt to climate-induced floods and improve ecosystem integrity for resilience building.",0.2305928827980831,0.37730816324742367,0.18465348074952856,0.3521536709403723,0.13625035863731694,0.24313253538295046,0.37997305697088296
Reducing flood risks in rural households: survey of perception and adaptation in the Mekong delta,"The Mekong Delta, one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, is the focus of international action for adaptation. Improved understanding of the exposures and perceptions at the local level will help residents to cope with natural disasters and future climate disruptions. In this study, we assess the exposure to floods that rural communities across the Mekong Delta are facing. Among the various natural disasters threatening the delta, extreme flooding is by far the most prevailing concern. By carrying out a field survey on 1350 residents, we characterize the flooding patterns and vulnerabilities of households in three geographically diverse provinces. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of current flood adaptation in these households in conditions of regular flooding, as well as to extreme flooding events, which become more intense and frequent due to climate change. While the findings suggest varying degrees of coping with seasonal flooding by raising the ground floors of their homes, their capacity to prepare for extreme floods is limited in spite of the residents' awareness of the changing dynamics of natural disasters in their locality. We also examine their perception to the effects of climate change and identify factors that influence their awareness.",0.2898306473989516,0.3885637831038709,0.14408665396415218,0.3702693920773905,0.1009970070971808,0.22129693894901453,0.3630060756836083
"Farmers perception and awareness of climate change: a case study from Kanchandzonga Biosphere Reserve, India","This study was an attempt to document the indigenous Lepcha people's perception on climate change-related issues in five villages of Dzongu Valley located in Kanchandzonga Biosphere Reserve, India. Personal structured questionnaire was used for interview of 300 households selected randomly. Results showed that 85 % of the households have perceived climate change, mainly in the form of increasing temperature and unpredictable pattern of rainfall. In terms of climate change-related events, 75 % of the households believed that wind is becoming warmer and stronger over the past years. Majority of the households have observed changes in crop phenology, while about 90 % agreed that the incidences of insect pest and diseases have increased over the years, especially in their large cardamom crop. A comparison of community perceptions, climatic observations and scientific literature shows that the community have correctly perceived temperature change, unpredictable occurrence of rainfall and increased incidence of insect pest and diseases, which have largely influenced the experiences and perceptions regarding climate-related events. Results reveal that households have adopted the use of locally available material as mulches against soil erosion, to conserve the soil moisture and manage soil temperature. Majority of the households have diversified their cropping system through traditional agroforestry systems and intercropping. Unfortunately, most of the households were unaware about the scientific sustainable approaches to combating impact of climate change.

Coping with weather adversity and adaptation to climatic variability: a cross-country study of smallholder farmers in South Asia,"Concerns over climate change and climatic variability are growing in South Asia because of the potential detrimental impacts of these phenomena on livelihoods. Such growing concerns demonstrate a need to assess how farmers simultaneously cope with extreme events and adapt to climatic variability. Based on household surveys of 2660 farm families conducted in Nepal's Terai, coastal Bangladesh, and the Indian state of Bihar, this paper seeks to (1) explore farmers' coping strategies under adverse weather events; (2) identify key adaptation measures used by farmers; and (3) explore the policy interventions required to adjust agriculture to climatic variability. The study reveals that migration is the most important coping strategy of the households in Bihar and coastal Bangladesh, while reliance on credit markets is the most important in Terai. Farmers in the areas with higher rainfall variability pursue a higher number of coping strategies compared to farmers in areas with lower rainfall variability. Food available months are also higher in areas with higher rainfall variability. Across all sites, the most frequently mentioned adaptive practices are changing cropping patterns and adoption of resilient crop varieties. A large number of farmers place emphasis on breeding crop varieties that tolerate adverse weather. Governments should implement a number of planned activities to cope with adverse events, with the aim that these activities would be synergistic with adaptation to climate change.",0.9485720328536558,0.22072484360306388,0.045253916066434426,0.6980961506878485,0.03673878186749511,0.019218064234016244,0.05931207446064604
Adaptation to climate change and its impacts on food productivity and crop income: Perspectives of farmers in rural Pakistan,"Evaluation of the ongoing efforts for farm level adaptation to climate change is crucial to understand their effectiveness and to suggest further actions at the policy level. The current study explores the adaptation of wheat farmers to climate change, its determinants and its impact on food productivity and crop income in rural Pakistan. This study is based on a primary dataset of 442 wheat farmers conducted through face-to-face structured interviews from 65 villages across three agro-ecological zones of Punjab Province, Pakistan. The study employs logistic regression analysis to find adaptation determinants and uses the propensity score matching technique to estimate the causal impact of adaptation on food productivity and crop income. The results of the study suggest that wheat farmers were well aware of climate change, but for various reasons did not adapt accordingly. The major adaptation strategies implemented by wheat farmers include changing planting dates, crop varieties and fertilizer types. Moreover, education, farming experience, access to agricultural extension, weather forecasting and marketing information were the factors that significantly affected farmers' adaptation decisions. Adapting wheat crops to climate change significantly and positively affects wheat productivity and net crop,income and hence indirectly improves the farmers' wellbeing and local food security. More benefits were achieved by farmers who used a combination of different adaptation strategies. The study suggests to focus on farmers' education, easy access to farm advisory services and information on new adaptation methods for sustainable food production and local food security.

"Migration from atolls as climate change adaptation: Current practices, barriers and options in Solomon Islands","Adaptive strategies are important for reducing the vulnerability of atoll communities to climate change and sea level rise in both the short and long term. This paper seeks to contribute to the emerging discourse on migration as a form of adaptation to climate change based on empirical studies in the two atoll communities, Reef Islands and Ontong Java, which are located in the periphery of Solomon Islands. The paper will outline current migration patterns in the two island groups and discuss how some of this migration may contribute to adaptation to climate change and other stresses. It shows that migration currently improves access to financial and social capital, reduces pressure on natural resources and makes island communities less vulnerable to extreme weather events and other shocks all factors that contribute positively to adaptive capacity. It also shows that there are major barriers to migration that reduce the efficacy of positive outcomes to both migrants and their home communities, including high transport costs and problems in gaining access to housing, employment and government services in urban destination areas. If it is accepted that voluntary migration may play a positive role in adaptation to climate change in exposed atoll communities, addressing some of the barriers to migration seems logical. This may be done by efforts to stimulate migrant income opportunities, by improving migrant living conditions and by improving the transport services to the islands.",0.31569957509402014,0.5,0.09621074094922928,0.5660937777775901,0.15490283134943206,0.127529227593568,0.06405274194952687
"The adaptation strategy of dwelling in the riverside settlement of the Arut River in Pangkalan Bun City, West Kotawaringin Regency, Central Kalimantan","This research entitled the adaptation strategy of dwelling in the riverside settlement of the Arut River in Pangkalan Bun City was conducted with the consideration that the settlement has a similar typology to settlements in the Kalimantan which are generally next to/on the rivers. This settlement, located both on the river and in the transition points between lands and rivers, is familiar with damp environments. The people dwelling in thisplace, dealing with damp environments and striving to continue their life, must adapt to such environment. Therefore, this research tries to discover what kind of strategy done by these people to live in this kind of settlement. The research method used is mixed method. Mixed method is a combination of quantitative methods based on interview data and questionnaire, and qualitative exploration method that is based on field observation in the exploration of adaptation strategies settled in Arut River settlement.

"Multiple risk management during agricultural production shortages in a mountain village in northern Laos-Roles of forest resources, livestock and the market economy","In areas with strongly seasonal climates, local people often use complex strategies to manage agricultural production shortages, including diverse activities such as hunting, selling and consuming non-agricultural products, and wage labor. We surveyed all the households in a village in northern Laos to evaluate how such livelihood activities varied during years with differing agricultural production conditions. We compared two years with normal rice production conditions (2010, 2012) and one year with a severe rice shortage (2011) due to a rodent outbreak. Earning wages inside and outside the village was the most important activity for mitigating rice shortages, followed by selling livestock and using/selling non-timber forest products. Villagers also borrowed rice from a village rice bank. Most cash income was earned from selling rice. We concluded that a balance of traditional risk management activities under the swidden system (e.g., raising livestock) with the more recent rice bank system and wages from the market economy will be critical for the sustainable development of mountain villages in northern Laos. Permanent crops and monocultures tend to make local livelihoods more dependent on a single crop, but maintaining the traditional swidden system will help local people to manage agricultural production shortages.

"Environmental change, resilience, and adaptation in nature-based tourism: conceptualizing the social-ecological resilience of birdwatching tour operations","Resilience theory has emerged as a holistic concept well suited to analyzing tourism systems and which promises important insights into the sustainability of tourism destinations in the face of accelerating global environmental change (GEC). This article presents empirical research into the social-ecological resilience of tour operators using the case study destination of the Otago Peninsula, Dunedin, New Zealand. It addresses the following research question: How do birdwatching tour operators build resilience to drivers of environmental change, including climatic drivers, into their operations? Qualitative interviews with providers of a specific nature tourism sector activity - birdwatching - were conducted with stakeholders including tour operators, conservation organizations, and local government members. The findings highlight current and possible future challenges to birdwatching tourism on the Otago Peninsula. The paper introduces a conceptual framework which highlights the tour operators' main coping strategies in response to key perceived social-ecological system (SES) drivers of change. Overall, tour operators perceived their main social-ecological resilience to be the diversity of the species of the Otago Peninsula, their business experience, and the strength of their local stakeholder network to respond to SES crises.",0.24098813475577954,0.40386025780720247,0.20614131490572474,0.43421840523213046,0.08461357941881772,0.0631849947647266,0.08112239773429218
'My new routine': Assessing the impact of citizen science on climate adaptation in Bangladesh,"Citizen science is put forward as a method for extending science to include communities in learning about, and adapting to, climate variability and change in the places they live. But it is difficult to find evidence of how citizen science influences climate adaptation governance. The citizen science field lacks the assessment frameworks and empirical studies for understanding impacts on citizen scientists' common adaptive capacities for supporting social processes of adaptation. In addressing this gap, this paper describes a citizen science initiative carried out with communities in northeast Bangladesh, and assesses how it contributed to local governance capacity for climate adaptation. In doing so, it develops and tests a novel framework that assesses citizen science's contributions a high-quality knowledge base, and to five different capital stocks. The assessment saw high increases in citizen scientists' human capital relative to their awareness and understanding of local rainfall; learning that they applied in adaptive practices at work and at home, and local leadership. There were also high increases in social capital among citizen scientists, but more moderate increases in technological and resource capital, and in political capital. There was some evidence of the citizen science being used to support public adaptation decision-making. The initiative had the least impact on institutional capital.",0.45226956375073524,0.4184679435339599,0.10404165919665975,0.3445651367160658,0.11864077615806526,0.10156252183000485,0.1030233291529515
Review of key initiatives and approaches to adaptation planning at the national level in semi-arid areas,"Semi-arid areas are found in a large number of countries and regions of Africa and South and Central Asia. They display high vulnerability to climate change with considerable adaptation needs. In this paper, we review country-level and multi-country projects supported by international agencies. We examine the priorities and goals presented in national adaptation planning documents and in sectorial planning documents. Through this analysis, we seek to compare adaptation needs with current trends in national, regional and global projects and collaborations. Our results suggest that initiatives supported by international agencies play a considerable role in achieving national adaptation priorities, especially in areas such as agriculture and water management. However, compared with specific adaptation options such as drought-resistant species and irrigation (which tend to be the scope of the projects), the analyzed documents tend to see challenges in agriculture more in the contexts of food security, livestock and rural development. They emphasize the strong connection between rural livelihoods and sustainable land and ecosystem management. Priorities listed in the national documents but not captured in current initiatives include human health, pastoralism, security and migration. Our results also show high levels of mainstreaming adaptation into sectorial planning documents, especially those on poverty reduction; however, compared with the focus on the project level, they here emphasize adaptations focused on institutional development and governance. Finally, the outcomes indicate that global, regional and national initiatives are distributed unequally and that countries in Central and West Africa and Central Asia currently exhibit low participation, especially in national projects.",0.450731888018057,0.3102865858781193,0.13054850193273118,0.41733580583889207,0.07802849848429796,0.10845295282074302,0.1011686661677898
Climate change and agriculture: Impacts and adaptive responses in Iran,"The impacts of climate change on agriculture are still shadowed with uncertainty. However, climate change is expected to adversely affect Iran's agricultural practices through changes in precipitation, temperature and carbon dioxide fertilization. Therefore, adaptation of this sector to the increasing weather events is imperative. This study is aimed to document the likely impacts of climate change on Iran's agriculture and the current adaptation efforts made by government and farmers. The review of literature shows that changes in rainfall and water endowments will have significant impacts on crop yield, crops' water requirements and income and welfare of farm families. The extent of the changes in yield depends on the crop type, assumptions related to the CO2 fertilization effect, climate scenarios and adaptation abilities. On adaptation, the government's efforts have been distinguished in the improving agricultural productivity and irrigation development based on current technology, developing new technologies and policy reforms. Farmers' adaptive responses have also been identified.

"Evolving high altitude livelihoods and climate change: a study from Rasuwa District, Nepal","This study examined local people's perception of climate change and its impacts on their livelihoods, and identified key opportunities and threats arising in four Village Development Committees in the high mountains of Rasuwa District, Nepal. The local people are still heavily dependent on agriculture and livestock for their food security and livelihoods, despite the involvement of a significant proportion of households in non-agricultural income-generating activities, such as tourist services and labour work in other areas (outmigration). In agriculture, farmers mainly cultivate traditional food crops such as millets, buckwheat, local beans, and barley. They also cultivate rice, potato, and vegetables. Agriculture is mainly rainfed with a few exceptions of micro-irrigation systems fed by springs and snow-melt water. The impacts of climate change are mixed to date: changes in patterns of snowfall and snowmelt, rainfall, and temperatures are having both positive and negative impacts. Households are adapting to this changing climate through changes in their cropping patterns, integration of livestock with agriculture, and adoption of non-farm income activities. There are also new opportunities coming up at the study sites such as new markets for vegetables, traditional crops, and livestock.",0.9683849982856987,0.17699287982759443,0.08165742653119391,0.6227190029951667,0.019493599540664736,0.011387663865843082,0.034068543279854216
The tea landscape of Assam: Multi-stakeholder insights into sustainable livelihoods under a changing climate,"Tea plays a pivotal role in India's national economy, with the state of Assam the world's largest regional producer of black tea. However, various socio-environmental factors are threatening tea production and the livelihoods of millions of people reliant upon the industry. Little documentation exists which provides comprehensive spatial insights into tea production practices and associated livelihoods. Additionally, vulnerability from climate change to those livelihoods dependent upon the tea landscape has received limited multi-level stakeholder qualification. Consequently, this paper goes towards addressing this knowledge deficit through adopting a sustainable livelihoods approach for investigating the tea landscape of Assam. Mixed social survey methods were used to document responses from multiple stakeholder groups representing managers of commercial plantations, smallholders and tea workers. Results provide a comprehensive insight into the livelihoods of those reliant upon tea production activities across the four major tea growing regions of Assam. Outputs indicate that varying production practices are in place to optimise yield, increase livelihood resilience and manage the landscape effectively under a changing climate, with tea workers possessing varying diversity in assets to support their livelihoods. Outcomes from this research highlight the need for adaptable and climate-smart landscape activities, with active support from expert tea advisory agencies, to promote long-term socio-environmental sustainable cultivation of tea under changing climatic conditions.",0.7139698923834259,0.32152687548580705,0.11966865615586872,0.47171184153549794,0.09990696301260553,0.04787311088380248,0.04123190689495952
"Impacts of environmental change on agroecosystems and livelihoods in Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal","To understand local perceptions of the impacts of environmental change in two mountain districts of Nepal - Myagdi and Mustang - between 2010 and 2014, a survey, focus groups, town hall meetings, and extensive consultation with local stakeholders were conducted, supplemented by analyses of soil, rainfall, and temperature data. Mountain people in Nepal shared their perceptions of environmental change in their everyday lives, including agricultural practices and tourism activities. While ordinary individuals welcome the construction of new roads, elites still prefer to maintain trails and the status quo. People are concerned about the introduction of mosquitoes, increases in insect pests and plant pathogens, and other vectors along with roads. Snowfall has decreased and rainfall has been unpredictable. Mean minimum winter temperatures have increased and the mountains are experiencing shorter winters and less snow accumulation, which threaten the livelihoods of people that depend on fresh water. While people with means are replacing their traditional homes with modern homes, that is beyond reach for average Mustangi citizens. Expansion and diversification of agriculture, adoption of sound soil management techniques in Marpha village of Mustang and Shikha village of Myagdi, and growing forest cover in Shikha are some indicators of enhanced community managed practices.

This study has adopted a perception-based approach to assess CCV, its effects in terms of extreme events and prioritize adaptation strategies to enhance resilience of the communities, in the Budhi Gandaki River Basin (BGRB), Nepal. It is likely that valuing local knowledge and experiences makes people more responsive to the intervention and backing up the perception results by scientific data analysis establishes a sense of legitimacy to what people have perceived. Results showed that people have perceived CCV in various forms such as increase in temperature, decrease in pre-monsoon and monsoon rainfall, and more erratic rainfall timing in recent years. These perceived impacts are consistent with trends in observed rainfall and temperature data in the study area. The CCV has led to increase in frequency of extreme events - both floods and droughts, and associated impacts. As an adaptation strategy, people prioritized 'technological measures' as the most effective for both flood and drought. The analysis provided herein confirms that combining scientific facts with people's perception helps establish more reliant knowledgebase of CC to better plan and develop climate-resilient communities.",0.7496109665642038,0.34958229564099663,0.09471470976697699,0.3351571177037452,0.0745381832610408,0.07831832162620506,0.2632307977765395
Risk communications: flood-prone communities of Kuala Lumpur,"This paper discusses the contemporary academic debates in the field of social vulnerability, social capital and adaptation, and hazard management with a focus on sharing of knowledge on flood risk management between the flood-prone communities and the authorities in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The study attempts to highlight the affected communities' vulnerability to environmental hazards, flood risk communication and management, all of which represent critical urban management issues in the rapidly expanding city of Kuala Lumpur. Respondents participating in this study include the various stakeholders consisting of several low-income squatter communities in Kuala Lumpur, officials from government agencies involved in flood risk management as well as community leaders. The study examines how the affected communities perceive their vulnerability and their responses in addressing these risks through their communications and sharing of knowledge among themselves, with the officials and other stakeholders.

Determinants of adaptation practices to climate change by Chepang households in the rural Mid-Hills of Nepal,"This study analyzes the factors influencing the adoption of various adaptation practices by a highly marginalized indigenous community in the remote rural Mid-Hills of Nepal. The analysis is based on a household survey conducted among 221 Chepang households selected randomly. A multivariate probit model was used to analyze five categories of adaptation choices against a set of socio-economic, institutional, infrastructural, and perception variables. Perception of rainfall changes, size of landholding, status of land tenure, distance to motor road, access to productive credit, information, extension services, and skill development trainings are all influential to enable households to deviate away from traditional coping strategies and adopt suitable practices to adapt to climate vagaries. Policies and development activities should be geared to address these determinants in order to facilitate adaptation.",0.837727374991734,0.294449300000187,0.08232956065999412,0.692647376788906,0.05769688324643053,0.031225757073313036,0.06129607794541343
Exploring Flood Resilience Thinking in the Retail Sector under Climate Change: A Case Study of an Estuarine Region of Taipei City,"With predictions of extreme precipitation and sea-level rise under climate change that may induce morphological changes of estuaries, increased estuarine flood risk needs to be considered. The aim of this case study was to contemplate sustainability from the perspective of flood resilience that focuses on environmental problems and solutions. The study provided insights into retailers' resilience thinking regarding the flood-prone Shetzu Peninsula in Taipei City. It is of concern that the retailers strategically identified potential flood risks and have developed adaptive knowledge, skills, and networks. The Location Quotient (LQ) analysis was conducted to verify that the retail sector of Shetzu Peninsula was considered a basic industry. Further assessments, an interactive visualization model and a consumption intensity map, were provided as supportive data. Based on the results, semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore 15 key retailers' resilience thinking on how to adapt to floods in terms of risk communication under climate change. This approach is vital to meet the adaptation challenge in the Shetzu Peninsula. As a result, the study indicated that retailers have strategically identified potential weather-related risks and have implemented adaptation plans for each store functions. The study discussed that, in the face of climate change, maladaptation, interactive visualization models for communicating flood risks, and place attachment are key issues to increase flood resilience under climate change. The introduction of adaptation interventions in terms of urban resilience as a part of a comprehensive strategy helps to manage the impacts of climate change towards urban sustainability.",0.2682028812232334,0.41214145551821246,0.12904416427477355,0.20153832413439557,0.11451321694842893,0.48688915236472463,0.41014864360722025
Assessing the capacity of Australian broadacre mixed farmers to adapt to climate change: Identifying constraints and opportunities,"Farmers are continually striving to adapt to Australia's highly variable climate. As a function of global warming, future climatic conditions will present further challenges, but may also present many new opportunities for farmers. We involved a range of rural communities via 14 workshops across a range of Australia's large-scale broadacre cropping regions employing a rural livelihoods framework to elicit and interpret community responses. Farmers identified indicators and rated them on the extent to which they might constrain or enable adaption to increased climate variability or climate change. Financial issues, such as low equity or limited capital were, considered to be most constraining, and natural capital assets, such as high soil productivity and low rainfall variability were considered to be most enabling. Most indicators were of broad-scale significance, affecting broadacre mixed farmers across a range of locations, and were not necessarily specific to climate change only. Broad-scale constraints identified were isolation/rural decline, limited access to services, poor regional infrastructure, equity/debt, and the high cost of production. Conversely, enabling factors identified were farmer education/experience, sense of community, and off-farm income. Actions to address these perceived constraints related to farm management practices, training, community, technology/research, communication, funding and institutional arrangements. In the Australian context, adapting to climate variability and change is more than just implementing a new technology, but is also about enhancing the broader resilience of the community in ways that will ensure its long term viability. To achieve this it will be necessary for different components of government and other institutional actors to work together to improve the adaptation capacity of farmers in the future.

How effective are coping mechanisms in securing livelihoods against climatic aberrations? Evidences from rural India,"Purpose - This paper aims to examine the consumption behaviour and effectiveness of coping mechanisms adopted by households living in disaster-prone regions of rural India to cope with climatic aberrations and extremes using household-level data. In developing countries like India, poor households living in rural regions face risks to their livelihood due to climatic aberrations like deficient monsoon spells and rainfall gaps. Although these risks are covariate, the impact depends on location and the relative capacity of the people to cope with them. Design/methodology/approach - Using household-level data, this paper attempts to examine the consumption behaviour and effectiveness of coping mechanisms adopted by households living in these areas to hedge against the risks. A tobit and a multivariate probit model is used in the process. Findings - Based on the empirical analysis, and subject to the assumptions and the usual limitations of data, the findings suggest that households resort to consumption smoothening by liquidating their assets or decreasing consumption. Originality/value - They adopt a wide variety of ex-post risk-coping measures with limited success to overcome the shocks to their livelihood. Household-specific characteristics like age and education level of the household head are important in the choice of a particular coping option along with other key variables. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0.6011336658383382,0.35668206431428157,0.06808886651753154,0.6776188716738903,0.03149325740510428,0.1104997076927976,0.10222720705370777
Vulnerability of women to climate change in arid and semi-arid regions: The case of India and South Asia,"This article is a collation and synthesis of the literature review with the focus on the vulnerability of rural women in developing countries to climate change on the one hand and being pro-active in adapting to climate change on the other. The geographic coverage of the literature is global but with specific examples from India. The information presented in this paper is derived from diverse sources including journal articles and thematic books, and indicates severe adverse impacts not only on women's livelihood opportunities but also on exacerbating the workload and fatigue while decreasing their self esteem and forcing them to undertake some high risks and hazardous activities. The literature indicates that poverty, gender inequality, insecure land rights, heavy reliance on agriculture, less access to education and information are among the principal reasons for their vulnerability to climate change. The vulnerability is also confounded by the meager asset base, social marginalization, lack of mobility and exclusion from the decision-making processes in response to a disaster. However, the literature also shows that women are not only the passive victims of climate change but are also pro-active and agents of hope for adaptation to and mitigation of abrupt climate change. They utilize their experience and expertise to reduce the adverse impacts by adopting prudent strategies. They are also concerned about environmental issues, and are highly supportive of policies regarding environmental restoration. Large knowledge gaps exist regarding the vulnerability of women to changing and uncertain climate especially in arid regions. Authors of this article suggest some action plans and strategies to minimize vulnerability to climate change such as empowering women economically and educationally, organizing training and outreach programmes, and involving them in formal climate change mitigation and adaptation policies and programmes. Authors also outline research needed in order to identify and implement strategies regarding climate change. Collective and continuous efforts are critical to finding the sustainable solutions for this global phenomenon which is adversely impacting the most vulnerable but critically important members of the society.

"Farmers' adaptation to climate change in the Tengger Mountains (case study in Ngadas Village, Poncokusumo District, Malang Regency, East Java, Indonesia)","The data of Statistics Central Bureau of Malang Regency Year 2010-2015 shows a decline in potato production in PoncokusomoDistrict. Climate change has caused a decrease in production and encouraged farmers to adapt. This study aimed to describe farmer's knowledge and adaptation strategies against climate change. The data were processed using descriptive analysis and logistic regression test. Respondents of this research are 85 farmers of Ngadas Village determined by purposive sampling. The results show that: 1) Potato farmers in NgadasVillage feel the climate change through the parameters of climate change, that is the change in season, a drop in temperature and wind speed slowdown. However, farmers who know and understand climate change are still in a small number. Farmers feel the impacts of climate change, such as landslides and the increase of water availability; 2) Potato farmers in Ngadas Village are in the stage of adjustment to climate change that has occurred today. The choice of adaptation taken by farmers is to change the time of planting, and 3) The factors that have an influence on the decision of potato farmersin Ngadas Village to adapt are education, access to climate information, land ownership and intuition. © Global Science Publications.",0.9765682057602415,0.15299062373491543,0.0852960273970115,0.4660089703718874,0.021321998702289034,0.013544645408034543,0.018228304242135014
Risks and responses in rural India: Implications for local climate change adaptation action,"People in drylands face multiple climatic and non-climatic risks and subsequently engage in various response strategies to manage these risks. Research on risk management has typically focussed on a static, location-specific understanding of risk and response. However, empirical evidence suggests that risks and vulnerability vary across space and time. Increasingly, responses traverse multiple locations e.g. people move across rural and urban areas, women move beyond the household/community to earn additional incomes. To highlight this dynamic reality of risks and responses, we study livelihood transitions in South India. We unpack risk and response portfolios across scales - household, community, and sub-national (district) levels - and classify them as coping, adaptive and maladaptive. Our findings emphasise that present responses do not necessarily qualify as climate change adaptation strategies. While certain strategies do improve household wellbeing in the short run, there is relatively lower evidence to suggest an increase in adaptive capacity to deal with climatic risks in the future. These findings point to critical gaps in understanding current risk management and how it can contribute to local adaptation policymaking and implementation.",0.48106733353383335,0.37613644740319646,0.13191620192524944,0.3838341670706438,0.11293131004050326,0.11242200518604077,0.14207311400249176
Livelihood Diversification as a Climate Change Coping Strategy Adopted by Small-Scale Fishers of Bangladesh,"Coastal areas and wetlands are on the frontline of climate change and variability in Bangladesh. Small-scale coastal and floodplain fishers continually face a host of cross-scale stressors, some induced by climate change. This research is based on 21-month long field study carried out in two coastal and floodplain fishing villages represented by two distinct ethnic groups. Adopting nuanced people-centered ethnographic approach of field research, this study examines the ways small-scale fishers address the arrays of stressors in order to construct and reconstruct their livelihoods. Findings of our study highlight fishers’ capability to plan and construct creative livelihood strategies and their adaptability in the face of stresses. We observed that fisher’s coping strategies comprise a fluid combination of complex overlapping set of actions that they undertake based on their capabilities, socio-cultural embeddedness, and experiential learning under different adverse situations. Broadly, the coping strategies embody under economic, physiological, social, survival, institutional and religiosity-psychological factors. In this article, considering its predominant roles, only economic dimensions of coping actions that fishers undertake under unusual and abnormal stresses for survival and well-being are analyzed. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",0.5252449159497008,0.36136459496565987,0.12268397167444392,0.5818754884392086,0.3519379125480891,0.07438860864860852,0.09580583569823217
Developing Adaptation Policies in the Agriculture Sector: Indonesia's Experience,"Agriculture plays an important role in Indonesia's economy. The country has made tremendous efforts to increase farm productivity in the past two decades with some noticeable increase in farm incomes and living standards in rural areas. While the country attained self-sufficiency in rice and maize in 2009 (GIEWS, 2010), it has a long way to achieve national food security in a growing economy and population. Realizing the impending threats of climate change, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has initiated a number of policy interventions during recent years. Some of the notable initiatives include greater emphasis on system of rice intensification (SRI), training of farmers on best agricultural practices through climate field schools, upgrading of irrigation systems through asset management, and developing rice cropping calendars in response to climate change. The programmes and projects supported by the government and/or various donor agencies have played a significant role in increasing climate resiliency in agriculture. A few lessons could be drawn based on the review of the adaptation actions identified by the GOI and interviews with its officials. Challenges were identified in priority policy setting, development of scientific basis as well as infrastructure and organizational structures, transfer of knowledge and technologies, and policy coordination government agencies.

"Many issues, limited responses: Coping with water insecurity in rural India","We present empirical evidence of coping strategies practiced in response to water insecurity and emerging climate variability in a dry, sub-humid rural district in India. We find non-climatic factors to be largely responsible for the existing water insecure conditions and, as perceived, climatic variations are found to magnify the misery. The causes and impacts of water insecurity result in a complex vicious cycle, pushing rural livelihoods and domestic life to further deprivation and poverty. Counter responses, mostly coping strategies, are found to be spontaneous, reactive and are largely motivated by crisis, which often degrades the resource base, and are found to be detrimental to the health and well-being of the studied communities. We question the advisability of water supply provisions in rural areas that fail to acknowledge the water demands of rural communities. Localized initiatives, including location specific strategies, must be formulated with effective community participation and in conjunction with other developmental programs to ensure water security in rural areas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",0.5185471653646573,0.3113362485994407,0.13569171102436925,0.48303733863349896,0.03383303321535975,0.09211504027013925,0.7744902308597993
Environmental Stressors and Migration: Evidence from Vietnam,"The argument that environmental change is an important driving force of migration has experienced a strong revival in the climate change context. While various studies predict large environmental migration flows due to climate change and other environmental events, the ex post empirical evidence for this phenomenon is inconclusive. We contribute to the extant literature by focusing on the micro-level. We examine whether and how individual perceptions of different types of environmental stressors induce internal migration. The analysis relies on original survey data from Vietnam including both migrants and non-migrants. The results suggest that individual perceptions of long-term environmental events, such as droughts, significantly reduce migration while perceptions of sudden-onset environmental events, such as floods, significantly increase the likelihood of migration controlling for other determinants of migration. These findings also imply that improving the targeting of aid to environmental disaster-affected areas and the financial and technical support for adaptation to environmental change could be the most productive policy-options. Policymakers, thus, need to implement a wide range of developmental policies in combination with environmental ones in order to improve society's ability to effectively cope with environmental change and minimize its effect on migration.

A Study of Flood Disaster Risk Communication Model and Adaptive Behaviours for River-Watershed residents in Taiwan,"Due to global climate change, rainfall patterns have become more centralized and are causing serious damage more frequently and heavily. After the experiences of typhoons in Taiwan, the importance of risk communication with residents, especially in the vulnerable river watershed area, has become the main issue of disaster prevention policy; however, this effort is frustrated by the lack of related academic research. This study aims to analyse key factors in risk communication mechanisms and how they influence the decision-making of adaptive behaviours. Firstly, this study builds a conceptual framework of the risk communication process to determine how adaptive behaviours are triggered and guided by risk communication. Questionnaires based on this framework were sent to households in the Kaoping River watershed area to verify its utility using a structural equation model (SEM). Based on the framework, an empirical analysis was performed to analyse the key factors influencing decision-making of adaptive behaviours using multinomial logistic regression. The results show that adaptive behaviours are affected by internal awareness of disaster and by risk communication mechanisms and the external environment. The crucial communication channels through family, friends, neighbours and local governments are highly effective. The key factors influencing decision-making of adaptive behaviours are awareness of disaster and adaptive behaviours. People with higher awareness of disaster and adaptive behaviours are more likely to have positive adaptive behaviours. Furthermore, due to the interaction of environments, risk communication patterns and socioeconomic attributes, people from different communities have different adaptive behaviours. Based on the empirical results, some risk communication measures are proposed to improve disaster-prevention strategies.",0.43250873420146513,0.3525693427583156,0.12611292475949915,0.26200185961764233,0.09854834897156604,0.1417281706205383,0.28912887999613796
Climate-induced Migration in South Asia: Migration Decisions and the Gender Dimensions of Adverse Climatic Events,"There is significant interest in determining the role of climate-induced shocks as a prominent driver on migration decisions of different groups of farmers in South Asia. Using data from a survey of 2,660 farm-families and focused group discussions in Bihar (India), Terai (plains) (Nepal) and coastal Bangladesh, we employed logistic regression to investigate household response towards migration and gender dimensions of adverse climatic events. The results suggest that migration decisions depend on farmers' unique resource profiles: (a) households that use migration to improve their resilience, mostly resource rich households; (b) households that have no alternative but to migrate, mostly poor farmers; and (c) households who cannot migrate due to different socio-economic obligations, mostly farmers with intermediate level of income that also includes women, children and elderly of different income profiles. These profiles represent a spectrum with households within a profile being closer to one or the other of the profiles on either side. They are not mutually exclusive and serve as a point of departure for further research to refine key explanatory variables. Given that some members of the household pursue migration as a result of adverse climatic events, government strategies are required to mitigate risks at destinations and create opportunities for the trapped populations.",0.715922768703914,0.2966470570853662,0.04622875337238466,0.7417051344571229,0.07131495458061524,0.04378595097892836,0.05345500329245545
The Costs of Living with Floods in the Jamuna Floodplain in Bangladesh,"Bangladeshi people use multiple strategies to live with flooding events and associated riverbank erosion. They relocate, evacuate their homes temporarily, change cropping patterns, and supplement their income from migrating household members. In this way, they can reduce the negative impact of floods on their livelihoods. However, these societal responses also have negative outcomes, such as impoverishment. This research collects quantitative household data and analyzes changes of livelihood conditions over recent decades in a large floodplain area in north-west Bangladesh. It is found that while residents cope with flooding events, they do not achieve successful adaptation. With every flooding, people lose income and assets, which they can only partially recover. As such, they are getting poorer, and therefore less able to make structural adjustments that would allow adaptation in the longer term.",0.5692704763623053,0.3426444985743316,0.09044347461838616,0.5509081278978201,0.10136498222520335,0.07830970231441593,0.12782135263095198
Farming adaptation to environmental change in coastal Bangladesh: shrimp culture versus crop diversification,"Farming in coastal Bangladesh includes rice/shrimp and rice/non-rice cropping systems. The former has been highly profitable but has exacerbated salinization of soil and water. We evaluate the relative profitability, riskiness, and sustainability of the two cropping systems, using data from two coastal villages in Khulna District. Shrimp cultivation was initially very rewarding. However, over 12-15 years, the cropping system experienced declining profitability, increased salinity, and adverse impacts on rice cropping and the local environment. From 2009, farmers adapted the system by changing the pond (gher) infrastructure, adopting delayed planting of a saline-tolerant rice cultivar, flushing out accumulated salt with freshwater during rice cropping, and allowing the soil to dry out after harvesting rice. The budgeting results show that with current management practices, the rice/shrimp system is economically more viable (higher returns to land and labour and less risky) than the rice/non-rice system. Soil analyses showed that while salinity was higher in the gher during the dry season, it was significantly reduced in the wet season and was very similar between the two systems (1-2 dS/m). Hence, as well as being more profitable and less risky, the rice/shrimp system may well be more sustainable than previously observed.",0.9319511256757127,0.1698888521001876,0.110906220317086,0.3783358674548073,0.17055203641143926,0.027146590337473527,0.050678162941970535
How are coastal households responding to climate change?,"In Australia, shared responsibility is a concept advocated to promote collective climate change adaptation by multiple actors and institutions. However, a shared response is often promoted in the absence of information regarding actions currently taken; in particular, there is limited knowledge regarding action occurring at the household scale. To address this gap, we examine household actions taken to address climate change and associated hazards in two Australian coastal communities. Mixed methods research is conducted to answer three questions: (1) what actions are currently taken (mitigation, actions to lobby for change or adaptation to climate impacts)? (2) why are these actions taken (e.g. are they consistent with capacity, experience, perceptions of risk); and (3) what are the implications for adaptation? We find that households are predominantly mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and that impact orientated adaptive actions are limited. Coping strategies are considered sufficient to mange climate risks, proving a disincentive for additional adaptive action. Influencing factors differ, but generally, risk perception and climate change belief are associated with action. However, the likelihood of more action is a function of homeownership and a tendency to plan ahead. Addressing factors that support or constrain household adaptive decision-making and action, from the physical (e.g. homeownership) to.the social (e.g. skills in planning and a culture of adapting to change) will be critical in increasing household participation in adaptation.

Climate adaptation planning in the higher education sector,"Purpose There is a growing interest in climate change action in the higher education sector. Higher education institutions (HEIs) play an important role as property owners, employers, education and research hubs as well as leaders of societal transformations. The purpose of this paper was therefore to benchmark how universities globally are addressing climate risks. Design/methodology/approach An international survey was conducted to benchmark the sector's organisational planning for climate change and to better understand how the higher education sector contributes to local-level climate adaptation planning processes. The international survey focused especially on the assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation plans. Findings Based on the responses of 45 HEIs located in six different countries on three continents, the study found that there are still very few tertiary institutions that plan for climate-related risks in a systematic way. Originality/value The paper sheds light on the barriers HEIs face in engaging in climate adaptation planning and action. Some of the actions to overcome such hindering factors include integrating climate adaptation in existing risk management and sustainability planning processes, using the internal academic expertise and curriculum to assist the mapping of climate change impacts and collaborating with external actors to guarantee the necessary resources.

Adapting to risk and perpetuating poverty: Household's strategies for managing flood risk and water scarcity in Mexico City,"Adaptation is typically conceived uniquely in positive terms, however for some populations, investments in risk management can entail significant tradeoffs. Here we discuss the burden for households of coping with, and adapting to, adverse water conditions in economically marginal areas of Mexico City. We argue that households' efforts to adapt in conditions of marginality can come at the expense of households' investment in other aspects of human welfare, reinforcing poverty traps. Both economic theory and social-ecological systems analysis point to the importance of cross-scalar investments and institutional support in breaking down persistent poverty traps. Using data from twelve focus groups conducted in Mexico City, we illustrate how such cross-scale connectivity is failing as a result of lack of trust and transparency, the difficulty of collective action, and the devolution of some responsibilities for risk management from the, public sector to the household level. We conclude our analysis by arguing for greater attention to these tradeoffs in public policy to help ensure that adaptation does not come at the cost of more generic welfare gains among the most vulnerable populations.

Institutional responses to climate change: opportunities and barriers for adaptation in the Pantanal and the Upper Paraguay River Basin,"Climatic change is expected to have serious impacts on the Pantanal, a large tropical wetland located in the Upper Paraguay River Basin, in the centre of South America, where a range of institutional responses are being developed to mitigate and adapt to climate change. In order to examine the institutional achievements and challenges for managing the region, a specific typology is initially introduced, which comprises a schematic gradient of institutional responses. An empirical analysis was conducted in Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, the three countries that share the Pantanal, which identified the hybrid basis of the policy framework under construction, in the sense that it actually combines elements of various institutional responses included in the proposed typology. Important factors that seem to undermine the efficacy of institutional responses in addressing climate change in the region are the strong influence of the agribusiness sector and the still relatively low importance of the Pantanal for national environmental policy-making. This essay makes a claim that the principles of climate justice should guiding policies and interventions as it they constitute the most appropriate strategy to address the inequality and unfairness related to climate change.",0.40093143999412345,0.33166882195961334,0.16010162709404227,0.39411702651184555,0.06653502334378757,0.06623847924335508,0.16487030236035308
"Ecological resilience to coffee rust: Varietal adaptations of coffee farmers in Copan, Honduras","Coffee leaf rust (CLR) attacked Central American coffee farms during the post-2011 epidemic, driving production loss across the region. In response, smallholders are adapting agroecological and conventional practices. We compare varietal adaptations of small conventional and organic farmers in Copan, Honduras. We show farmers are growing a greater diversity of varieties after the outbreak. Both groups increased acreage of CLR-resistant varieties; however, our data suggests organic farmers maintained greater acreage of CLR-susceptible varieties than conventional farmers. These results have important consequences for the specialty market, fungicide use, and management.

The influence of community-based resource management institutions on adaptation capacity: A large-n study of farmer responses to climate and global market disturbances,"An underlying understanding among adaptation and community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) scholars is the existence of important feedbacks between local resource management institutions and individual adaptive capacity. The relationship between CBNRM and individual adaptive capacity is of global concern given the ubiquity of CBNRM worldwide, the patent impacts of global changes at local levels, and the recent calls for the integration of climate and rural development policies. So far, however, there have not been formal, large-n studies of that relationship. This study aims to fill that gap by testing whether the performance of community based water management institutions and communal land regimes have an impact on the effectiveness of farmers' adaptation responses to climatic and global market disturbances. For this purpose, the study relies on a unique dataset of individual and collective features obtained from water user associations (WUAs) and ejidos in Mexico. According to the regression results, well-functioning community-based water management institutions have a positive and significant impact on individual farmers' self-reported response effectiveness. The impact of communal land property is also significant but negative. These effects, which hold only in the context of climate disturbances but not market disturbances, can be explained by looking at the support given by the associations to farmers, and issues of communal land marginalization, respectively. Policies that strengthen the autonomy and capacity for cooperation of WUAs and ameliorate structural deficits in communal land regimes shall not only guarantee a long-advocated path for rural development but also help farmers deal with some of the climatic uncertainties that increasingly threaten agriculture.",0.7514511459032259,0.2981768773348787,0.15519776646471398,0.3681245420522135,0.06199609038046786,0.05060396878866549,0.518990698116663
"Landraces as an adaptation strategy to climate change for smallholders in Santa Catarina, Southern Brazil","Adapting to climate change has become a pressing and urgent issue given the alarming rapidity with which climate changes is taking place. Agriculture is strongly conditioned by climatic factors, but subsistence agriculture is particularly vulnerable because smallholders do not have adequate financial resources to adapt to climate change. Agrobiodiversity provides one option for smallholders to adapt to climate change. Landraces developed in the western region of Santa Catarina State, Brazil, are part of a deliberate strategy by smallholders to achieve a state of food sovereignty and independence from commercial sources of hybrid seed. The ability of smallholders to collectively conserve climate-adapted landraces indicates the depth of local knowledge and capability within local communities that can be drawn on to meet the future challenges of climate change.

Local ecological knowledge and incremental adaptation to changing flood patterns in the Amazon delta,"The need for understanding the factors that trigger human responses to climate change has opened inquiries on the role of indigenous and local ecological knowledge (ILK) in facilitating or constraining social adaptation processes. Answers to the question of how ILK is helping or limiting smallholders to cope with increasing disturbances to the local hydro-climatic regime remain very limited in adaptation and mitigation studies and interventions. Herein, we discuss a case study on ILK as a resource used by expert farmer-fishers (locally known as Caboclos) to cope with the increasing threats on their livelihoods and environments generated by changing flood patterns in the Amazon delta region. While expert farmer-fishers are increasingly exposed to shocks and stresses, their ILK plays a key role in mitigating impacts and in strengthening their adaptive responses that are leading to a process of incremental adaptation (PIA). We argue that ILK is the most valuable resource used by expert farmer-fishers to adapt the spatial configuration and composition of their land-/resource-use systems (agrodiversity) and their produced and managed resources (agrobiodiversity) at landscape, community and household levels. We based our findings on ILK on data recorded for over the last 30 years using detailed ethnographic methodologies and multitemporal landscape mapping. We found that the ILK of expert farmer-fishers and their ""tradition of change"" have facilitated the PIA to intensify a particular production system to optimize production across a broad range of flood conditions and at the same time to manage or conserve forests to produce resources and services.",0.6555063627698704,0.3712762656969246,0.184954434237291,0.4806418611628099,0.12047611252874427,0.04701779273832811,0.17113797060147184
Implementing climate variability adaptation at the community level in the Amazon floodplain,"The need to design measures for adapting to climate change is increasingly recognized as important and has encouraged research on the role of local ecological knowledge (LEK) in supporting adaptation. Studies of how LEK can help adapt to increasing climate variability remain limited. This article develops an approach through which the process of adaptation can be tracked at a community level. We describe how community residents in the Amazon floodplains incorporate natural hydrologic and ecological processes into their management systems to optimize ecosystem functioning. We describe two case studies where LEK is used as a resource by small-scale fisher-farmers in the Amazon floodplains to adapt to the increasing impacts on their livelihoods generated by changing climate patterns. This article draws on local histories and seeks to identify the critical factors that either facilitate or impede household ability to reduce their vulnerability. We found that the LEK of small fisher-farmers has facilitated the adaptation of a resource management system to optimize production across a broad range of floodplain habitats and conditions. There are, however, significant challenges to operationalizing these approaches, including an absence of systematically collected data on adaptation strategies and outcomes. In addition, local people must be integrated into policymaking processes so their knowledge can contribute to the design of locally appropriate policies for adapting to-the impacts of climate related events.

"Community perceptions of socioecological stressors and risk-reducing strategies in Tabasco, Mexico","Rural inhabitants in many parts of the world face multiple stressors associated with socioecological and climatic change, yet their risk-reducing strategies have rarely been linked to these stressors. Extant studies present unclear and often unspecific definitions of adaptation or focus on just one type of stressor rather than acknowledging that there can be multiple responses to myriad stressors. In an attempt to overcome some of these gaps, we utilize a typology of adaptation strategies that addresses deficiencies in the current adaptation literature. This research draws on qualitative interview data to examine resident perceptions of water-related socioecological and climatic changes and potential risk-reducing strategies within small rural communities in Tabasco, Mexico. The increased frequency of drought and flooding in low-lying areas near the Usumacinta River has reduced local community members’ ability to sustain their livelihoods. Results from interview analysis show that residents are using four major strategies that they perceive as helping them respond to water-related problems. They are mobility, diversification, communal pooling, and environmental management. Our findings contribute to understandings of rural community risk reduction strategies that may be shared by other rural communities in places around the world experiencing negative climate change impacts. © 2018, AESS.",0.6108806846074895,0.3610233766535255,0.1449337697712862,0.44724243194146746,0.08417007214586328,0.0771098312625165,0.39371514449415335
"What influences disaster risk perception? Intervention measures, flood and landslide risk perception of the population living in flood risk areas in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil","The flooding and landslides catastrophe in 2011 in the mountainous area of Rio de Janeiro State in Brazil affected more than 300,000 people and created unquantifiable material losses, mostly in the Nova Friburgo Municipality. Even with the available technologies, programs and measures for disaster prevention, the population was not prepared. Following international frameworks like the Hyogo, governmental institutions related to risk management started working with the population to improve response, preparedness and perception. This work aims to evaluate disaster risk perception (DRP) and intervention measures of the population living in flood risk areas and relate it to variables such as landslide risk perception, experienced disasters and intervention measures taken from institutions and the population. Through 391 quantitative questionnaires and 20 semistructured qualitative interviews, we reveal the connection between DRP, the people who may be affected and the strategies for response and preparedness of the institutions. Using descriptive statistics, factor analysis and regression, we develop six main factors related to risk perception. The regression defines flood risk perception (FRP) as the dependent factor and exposes the small influence on FRP from state and municipal institutions working with disaster risk reduction (similar to 0.01) in comparison to past experiences (similar to 0.52), demographic characteristics (similar to 0.29) and local influences (similar to 0.62). Supporting literature about DRP, examples about institutional influences are given.

Microfinance for ecosystem-based adaptation (MEbA) in Peru and Colombia,"The consequences of extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods pose an increasing threat to the rural and peri-urban communities of Peru and Colombia. Although these communities have already taken measures to adapt to these adverse effects under the scenario of extreme climate change, the need to effectively diffuse and transmit information and knowledge regarding climate change and climate change resilience persists. The execution of investments in ecosystem-based adaptation activities aims to improve the communities' resilience to these threats and to ensure the sustainability of ecosystem services on which these communities depend. The Microfinance for Ecosystem-based-Adaptation to Climate Change (MEbA) project was conceived in 2012 to promote and support the introduction of specific (micro) financial products and services. The main pillars of the project are: 1) assistance in the development and implementation of new financial products and services tailored to rural populations that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change (e.g. small agricultural producers and other local actors of the North Andean Region); 2) provision of customized capacity building to microfinance institutions (MFIs); and 3) awareness raising, carrying out training activities which address identified knowledge gaps, and meeting MFI client needs to increase climate change resilience with a focus on Ecosystem-based Adaptation via partnerships with key local technical actors. The focus of this paper is to present the MEbA project in detail, and to explore the role of MFIs with regard to adaptation to climate change and the link between ecosystems and adaptation to climate change. © Practical Action Publishing, 2015.",0.5,0.35828837285893245,0.15942885160180126,0.32886403661981783,0.07483801203803118,0.08898639072155651,0.16195098780985565
How do biosphere reserves influence local vulnerability and adaptation? Evidence from Latin America,"Resource management regulations, such as those associated with the establishment of protected areas, can increase vulnerability and compromise individual and collective agency for adaptation. In this article, we comparatively analyse how four rural communities located within two biosphere reserves in Mexico and Bolivia experience vulnerability and adaptation to global change. We use focus groups, interviews and scoring exercises to analyse the influence of reserve management practices on locally perceived changes and stresses on livelihoods, and to discuss communities' coping and adaptation strategies. We show that both reserves are perceived as a source of stress but somewhat differently. In Mexico, communities feel vulnerable to the reserve's regulations but less to climatic and economic stresses, whereas in Bolivia communities perceive the insufficient enforcement of the reserve's rules as the most relevant stress to their livelihoods. Most of household-based and collective adaptations to environmental change have been adopted without the support of the biosphere reserves. We discuss how and why the biosphere reserves contribute to local vulnerability and why their role in enhancing local adaptation is limited. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

On the evaluation of adaptation practices: a transdisciplinary exploration of drought measures in Chile,"A severe drought has affected central Chile since 2009. Various adaptation responses have been developed, and a participatory process is required to learn from them. To enable this, a transdisciplinary approach was adopted to achieve two objectives: first, to test an approach for assessing the effectiveness of existing measures to respond to drought, specifically to distil strengths and weaknesses of implementation, and developing recommendations; second, to reflect on results from a pilot project conducted to ascertain its potential for scalability in terms of processes employed. The research was organized per the three types of knowledge needed to address complex problems through transdisciplinarity: systems, target and transformation knowledge. Using the recent drought as a boundary object, we conducted the pilot in two locations in Chile where we carried out literature reviews, interviews and focus group discussions were carried out. We identified adaptation measures at national and local scale, a set of which were evaluated applying the Index for the Usefulness of Adaptation Practices (IUPA). Results indicate that through IUPA, we could systematically account for the perceived effectiveness of applied measures. Strengths such as autonomy in the decision-making process emerged as key factors that could also be applied in other contexts, whereas weaknesses such as lack of integration with other policy domains, programs or projects were identified. To address weaknesses, key recommendations were proposed, which are congruent with context-specific expectations, capacities, experiences and knowledge, given that they were articulated by local actors. Results present empirical evidence on the important utility of transdisciplinary approaches in the evaluation of adaptation measures and can support the development of metrics related to adaptation process at the local scale.",0.5,0.3565244214044669,0.11155580665750571,0.3123748089824451,0.08888658316231068,0.1055324899607897,0.21990335458582627
Sustentability and climate variability: Participatory agroecologycal actions to adaptation and socio-ecological reesilience in the colombian high-andean region,"Climate variability constitutes actually one of the main risks to agriculture and food security in the world. The most vulnerable ecosystems in Colombia are located in the high region of the Andeans where thousands of families farming lives from agriculture in small scale. The programs aimed to adapt the agriculture to climate variability do not take into account the local knowledge; neither motivates communities to action. This research proposed an analysis of the relationship between sustainability and agricultural adaptation to climate variability in a participatory way, recognizing the main risk factors to agriculture sustainability using indicators and analyzing the effectiveness of improving plans to the agricultural adaptation capacity in the high-Andeans. It was developed as a study case with 13 farmers linked to the Agro-ecological Farming Net Association of Subachoque. 3 phases were developed: a) the creation of a framework regarding the main the risks factors to the agriculture; b) sustainability appraisal based on own indicators and c) implementation of plans to increase the agricultural adaptation capacity. The appraisal developed in 2 different moments showed improving in the 9 indicators suggesting that the implementation of actions to the sustainability of farming positively influenced on the farms capacity to face the risks of the climate variability.

Ecosystem-based Adaptation by smallholder basic grain farms in Guatemala and Honduras,"! In Central America maize and beans are usually cultivated by farmers who have small landholdings and live in vulnerable situations. Climate change is an important threat to these smallholder basic grain farmers, putting at risk their production systems and their livelihoods. The use of Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) can help them to adapt to climate change, however there is limited information on the use of EbA. The objective of the present work was to characterize the EbA strategies that smallholder basic grain farmers of four landscapes in Guatemala and Honduras use to increase their resilience to climate change. Using interviews and field measurements in 160 farms, between July 2014 and June 2015, we 1) explored how common the use of different EbA practices is, 2) documented the biophysical characteristics of these practices, and 3) explored if the implementation and characteristics of EbA practices differed among landscapes. Our results indicate that even though they own small land areas (mean maize plot area of similar to 0.68 ha), have low education levels and low access to technical training and advice, many smallholder basic grain farmers are using EbA practices in their farms. The most common EbA practices were the use of dispersed trees, home gardens and live fences. An ANOVA anlysis indicated significant differences in the use of different EbA practices among farmers, which suggests that farmers adapt practices in response to the social and biophysical conditions where they live. Our study suggests that smallholder basic grain farmers have the experience and the knowledge to use EbA practices and recognize the benefits derived from the implementation of such practices. However, in order to increase use of EbA practices, more technical, financial and political support is needed.",0.9185217381898735,0.1877508939680101,0.15166225895542185,0.4147820284352067,0.05987544768325769,0.025517379529113503,0.04067779200843488
Community adaptations to environmental challenges under decentralized governance in southwestern Uruguay,"Since the turn of the 21st century, climate change and globalization had substantial environmental impacts on the southwestern region of Uruguay. Rural community responses to environmental challenges have been influenced by recent political decentralization governments and programs. This study explores how community governance processes under decentralization influenced the mobilization of community capitals used for adaptation to environmental stresses in four communities of southwestern Uruguay. Research methods include semi-structured interviews conducted in 2012-2013 with key informants from market, state, and civil society and participant observation and minutes from local public meetings and assemblies in four communities of this region. Consultation facilitated adaptive actions by the national government to make national governmental programs and institutions more responsive to local needs. Community empowerment for adaptive actions at the local level was minimal, due to the limited resources that have been devolved, reinforcing historic and current dependency on regional and national governmental institutions for those resources.

Resourceless victims or resourceful collectives: Addressing the impacts of climate change through social capital in fringing coastal communities,"This paper explores how social capital can influence the sustainable use of coastal resources amidst Climate change in the East African cities of Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. It uses a conceptual model underpinned by social capital theory to help explain process that may be involved in potentiating resources to effectively respond to local changes. The paper is part of a larger study, which used an eclectic mix of in-depth, exploratory and robust data collection techniques, resulting in data that were both qualitative and interpretative. The actual case study involved four coastal resources user groups in Mombasa and Dar es Salaam, with membership ranging from 40 to 60 people per group. The paper finds a tendency by local resource users to self-organise through negotiated social practices, which are better suited, to respond to changes in local conditions. The social capital resource that these local actors bring into the management of resources is too significant to overlook, especially in the face of the uncertainties surrounding future changes in climate. Consequently, the use of coastal resources in cities in low income countries require workable approaches that privilege local actions, including social capital. The import of these findings is that, local practices of coastal resource management and use should be a part of humanity's wealth of adaptations that can serve both present and future sustainability needs, particularly so in the face of the expected impacts of climate change.

Urban planning and sustainable adaptation to sea-level rise,"Sea-level rise poses major challenges to coastal land uses, and therefore to urban planning processes. In theory, if done well, urban planning can lead to responses to sea-level rise that are socially and environmentally sustainable. In practice, urban planning processes may fall short of this ideal. We use multiple methods to describe and analyse how urban planning processes have led to adaptation to sea-level rise in Lakes Entrance in Victoria, Australia. Adaptation has principally taken the form of restrictions on development on low-lying land. In this town, which is considered particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise, the urban planning process and its outcomes have been controversial and divisive. Policies at the state level were imposed rapidly on this particular local community, and were later applied across the state. Our findings support the emerging consensus that to be sustainable, urban planning needs to: facilitate local ownership of adaptation responses; build collective action within local communities and between local communities and different arms and levels of government; and be fair in its application across space and over time. Addressing these social, dimensions of adaptation takes time, but they are a sine qua non of sustainable adaptation to sea-level, rise. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Corporate Adaptation Behaviour to Deal With Climate Change: The Influence of Firm-Specific Interpretations of Physical Climate Impacts,"While business tends to be seen as a substantial factor in causing climate change, climate-induced physical changes can also pose major challenges to firms in return. Firms can reduce their vulnerability to these changes by defining and implementing an adaptation strategy. Based on an empirical analysis of the oil and gas industry, this paper examines how the way firms interpret climate events in terms of awareness and vulnerability informs their measures to adapt to climate-induced physical change. In the empirical analysis, the paper derives four types of adaptation behaviour - pre-emptive, reactive, continuous, and deferred adaptation - that correspond with different degrees of awareness and vulnerability. The paper concludes with implications for management practice and policymakers.

Government response to climate change in China: a study of provincial and municipal plans,"In this paper, we provide an overview of local and regional climate change plans in China by scrutinizing planning documents from 16 cities, four autonomous regions, and 22 provinces. We develop and apply an evaluation protocol to understand goals, process, and strategies in these plans. We also conduct interviews with government officials to provide a context for subnational climate change planning. The results indicate that current climate change planning in China is characterized by the 'top-down' approach, in which the central governmental incentives play a vital role in shaping provincial and municipal plans. In addition, most plans have the following issues: vague definition of what characterizes a low-carbon city/region; deficiency in the quality of greenhouse gas inventory and reduction targets; insufficient strategies provided to respond to climate change; inadequate stakeholder engagement; and weak horizontal coordination. Finally, we offer recommendations to improve climate change planning in China.",0.24919262322690974,0.37006454897593466,0.14432996118054764,0.19857470381714457,0.05726386193098185,0.209577722016079,0.10435999810427257
"Integrating climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and urban planning: A review of Nicaraguan policies and regulations","The integration of risk reduction and climate change adaptation has become an urgent task in addressing increasing urban risk more effectively and efficiently. This paper analyses the extent to which climate change adaptation is integrated into the policies and regulatory frameworks that guide urban risk reduction in Nicaragua, and discusses related progress. The results reveal significant progress in integrating climate change adaptation into the policy and regulatory frameworks of the three relatively new fields of (a) disaster risk reduction, (b) environmental management and (c) urban planning. They show that differences in the degree of integration relate to the development and updates to policy instruments in each field, and the extent to which they are related to the implementation of international climate change agreements. Although initially climate change adaptation integration was focused on the protection of natural resources in general, and food production in particular, since 2008 authorities have shown increasing interest in a more comprehensive and integrated approach. Nevertheless, the integration of climate change adaptation into disaster risk reduction and urban planning still lags behind the advances made in the environmental management field, It is concluded that in order to achieve greater and more coherent integration of CCA and, ultimately, improve the way climate-related risks is dealt with, urban authorities need to systematically review current policies and regulations to assess the synergies and gaps. This requires inter-sectoral and participative work with the actors concerned at national and local level, as well as the establishment of related monitoring and learning mechanisms.

"An effective public health program to reduce urban heat islands in Quebec, Canada","In 2005, the Government of the Province of Quebec, Canada, adopted the Climate Change Action Plan for 2006 - 2012. The Institut national de sante publique du Quebec (National Institute of Public Health of Quebec), charged with implementing the health adaptation component of the Plan, worked to mitigate urban heat islands (UHI) by funding and evaluating 40 pilot projects. These projects explored different methods of fighting UHIs by greening cities in a participative and mobilizing approach led mainly by non-governmental organizations and municipalities. An assessment of temperatures before and after implementing various methods demonstrated that some actions enabled significant gains of coolness and more efficiently mitigated heat (reduction of concrete/asphalt surfaces, increasing vegetation, etc.). An assessment of quality of life showed that projects were positively received by users, especially by those living in vulnerable situations. A lifecycle analysis showed that from the environmental perspective, UHI mitigation measures that do not require fertilization or maintenance are preferable. Finally, communication efforts that raise awareness of UHI and mitigation are of significant importance to program success.",0.098066920538222,0.44823898308364424,0.08022319383476552,0.16710526668122622,0.059463191395051795,0.2893455980431886,0.07562000316102696
"Understanding climate coping as a basis for strategic climate change adaptation - The case of Queenstown-Lake Wanaka, New Zealand","Weather conditions that influence natural resource-based tourist destinations are likely to be affected by climate change, but our understanding of how businesses and destinations manage for present and future conditions is limited. In this study we report on the relationships between weather and tourism activities in the Queenstown-Lake Wanaka region, South Island, New Zealand. Key stakeholder interviews and a workshop form the empirical basis of this paper. Coping range application ideas derived from ecological management literature are used to develop a framework to understand and inform thinking and strategies around how tourism businesses and destinations are currently responding to the weather and perhaps could in future respond to climate change. Results show that within a destination individual businesses have widely varying relationships with the weather, with each type of activity operating within its own coping range to particular environmental gradients, for example temperature. Coping, which can be observed outside the 'ideal' range of a particular environmental gradient, requires business adjustments so as to cope with increasingly marginal conditions, up to a Critical Stop Point - the ultimate threshold. The data suggest that increased need for adjustments impacts on business viability, and more planned adaptation measures would be necessary to increase viability under increasingly detrimental climatic conditions. Discussion at a destination level workshop indicates that at and beyond thresholds, keystone industry and destination level strategic adaptation planning is required to ensure the viability of the destination as a whole.

Advocacy for urban resilience: UNISDR's Making Cities Resilient Campaign,"This paper reviews what local governments in more than 50 cities are doing with regard to disaster risk reduction. It draws on the reports of their participation in the global Making Cities Resilient Campaign and its 10 ""essential"" components, and on interviews with city mayors or managers. These show how resilience to disasters is being conceived and addressed by local governments, especially with regard to changes in their institutional framework and engagement with communities and other stakeholders, also in mobilizing finance, undertaking multi-hazard risk assessments, upgrading informal settlements, adjusting urban planning and implementing building codes. The paper summarizes what city mayors or managers view as key milestones for building resilience, and further discusses their evaluation of the usefulness of the campaign to them. It also discusses how a local government-focused perspective on disaster risk reduction informs our understanding of resilience. This includes how development can contribute much to disaster risk reduction as well as a more tangible and operational understanding of resilience (resistance + coping capacity + recovery + adaptive capacity) that local governments can understand and act on.",0.07261100286354967,0.4299879626574722,0.16229525280477952,0.17557853241162294,0.08462759681327219,0.5835629882895264,0.6428397677881298
The UK response to the challenge of climate change,"The paper provides a background for the need to address climate change globally. In particular, it shows how the UK has addressed and is approaching the implications of climate change especially for its deemed critical infrastructure and the civil engineering profession. In addition, it sets out UK government responses, legislation background and policy decisions with regard to risk and infrastructure adaptation. It highlights some worldwide examples of climate change issues and recent severe events in the UK, such as storms, high winds, flooding, high and low temperatures and their costly consequences. Reference is made to historical and recent severe weather events and consequences leading to proposed actions for the adaptation of critical infrastructure in the transport, utilities and energy sectors. A description of current UK research programmes addressing climate change issues is included. An outline of how the UK insurance and financial sectors have built climate change into their business operations is also given.",0.17997857293488623,0.3492592908276859,0.09822443144903462,0.1884132377383133,0.07075612991731658,0.24175069619904752,0.11259836825389584
Adaptive capacity of small-scale coastal fishers to climate and non-climate stressors in the Western region of Ghana,"Small-scale coastal fisheries (SSCF) in the Western region of Ghana are affected by a combination of climate and non-climate stressors. Coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to these stressors because of their proximity to the sea and high dependence on small-scale fisheries for their livelihoods. A better understanding of how fishing communities, particularly SSCF, respond to climate and non-climate stressors is paramount to improve planning and implementation of effective adaptation action. Drawing on the capitals framework, this study examines the adaptive capacity of SSCF to the combined effects of climate-related (increasing coastal erosion, and wave and storm frequency) and non-climate-related stressors (declining catches; scarcity and prohibitive cost of fuel; inconsiderate implementation of fisheries laws and policies; competition from the oil and gas industry; sand mining; and algal blooms). The findings show how fishers mobilise and use adaptive capacity through exploitation of various forms of capital, including cultural capital (e.g., local innovation); political capital (e.g., lobbying government and local authorities); social capital (e.g., collective action); human capital (e.g., local leadership); and natural capital (e.g., utilising beach sand) to respond to multiple stressors. Nevertheless, in many cases, fishers' responses were reactive and led to negative (maladaptive) outcomes. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of critically considering the interactive nature of capitals and how they collectively influence adaptive capacity in the planning and implementation of adaptation research, policy and practice.",0.3390255533013622,0.3841170865950784,0.16681884675434144,0.44661605648291325,0.4056635705027022,0.13417755672502488,0.20176870769917749
Where to begin municipal climate adaptation planning? Evaluating two local choices,"Adapting to the impacts of human-caused climate change is a critical challenge facing cities worldwide. But, local climate adaptation planning is in its infancy. Early on, cities must decide whether to take a narrow-scope approach focused solely on reducing risks from climate impacts or to take a broad-scope approach embedding adaptation planning within wider ranging community concerns. They also must decide whether or not to formally involve their planning agency in adaptation planning. We used content analysis methods to assess a national sample of United States municipal plans. We find that cities with plans with a narrow-scope approach, focused on reducing risks, perform better in terms of plan integration and including more land use policies that can steer development out of hazardous areas. Formal involvement of planning agencies in adaptation planning processes is associated with more plan integration, but not necessarily inclusion of more land use policies.",0.20768719904758334,0.3717846242540212,0.1915761913640119,0.23722911562039095,0.1266127222284102,0.4233829516146828,0.16408023909994662
State-of-the-practice assessment of climate change adaptation practices across metropolitan planning organizations pre- and post-Hurricane Sandy,"Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) throughout the United States are identifying goals and implementation strategies to reduce the impacts of climate change through transportation adaptation initiatives. Using vulnerability assessments as well as adaptation practices that support mitigation, MPOs are beginning to integrate climate change planning into the long range planning process. Evaluating the state-of-the-practice of adaptation planning and adaptation in support of mitigation is useful in that it helps identify gaps and areas of improvement. Therefore, this research investigates the state-of-the-practice of MPO adaptation planning using the Mid-Atlantic region as a case study. Surveys, administered in 2012 and 2014, are used to identify the level of progress of MPOs with regard to climate change adaptation practices as well as barriers before and after Hurricane Sandy. A cross-sectional analysis using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) maps the results of the surveys and spatially compares regional trends. The results of the case study suggest growing interest in adaptation efforts such as floodplain area designations and efforts to enhance coordination and collaboration as transportation jurisdictions respond to the potential climate change impacts. In addition, MPOs with dense, smaller geographic areas prioritize inter-jurisdictional collaboration as high, suggesting that they are more reliant on other agencies to maintain inter-connectivity of transportation networks and further implement adaptation planning practices.

Public Health Adaptation to Climate Change in Large Cities: A Global Baseline,"Climate change will have significant impacts on human health, and urban populations are expected to be highly sensitive. The health risks from climate change in cities are compounded by rapid urbanization, high population density, and climate-sensitive built environments. Local governments are positioned to protect populations from climate health risks, but it is unclear whether municipalities are producing climate-adaptive policies. In this article, we develop and apply systematic methods to assess the state of public health adaptation in 401 urban areas globally with more than 1 million people, creating the first global baseline for urban public health adaptation. We find that only 10% of the sampled urban areas report any public health adaptation initiatives. The initiatives identified most frequently address risks posed by extreme weather events and involve direct changes in management or behavior rather than capacity building, research, or long-term investments in infrastructure. Based on our characterization of the current urban health adaptation landscape, we identify several gaps: limited evidence of reporting of institutional adaptation at the municipal level in urban areas in the Global South; lack of information-based adaptation initiatives; limited focus on initiatives addressing infectious disease risks; and absence of monitoring, reporting, and evaluation.",0.051903810670670215,0.5544640570140602,0.07856253531528133,0.09313155899245268,0.0481916919534523,0.6561862950640921,0.07465147514453876
THE ROLE OF THE U.S. MAYORS AND URBAN FORESTS IN ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION,"Leadership at cities and municipalities can be instrumental in beginning local conversation regarding climate change and urban forest policies. Much research has been devoted to national climate change actions, but little is currently known about initiatives and actions at the local level. This study presents results of a survey of U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement ( MCPA) members, representing 1,054 cities and 93.6 million people, conducted to improve the understanding of how mayors view urban forest policies related to climate change. The goals of the study were to examine local government initiatives for climate change and urban forests and how mayors prioritize these investments. The results indicated that a variety of local climate change mitigation and adaptation actions were being pursued by member MCPA cities. This is important as the international climate change regime rarely acknowledges the role of cities tackling climate change, though they are vulnerable settlements and at the same time important emitters. Since MCPA represents the most heavily populated states as well as the majority of the state capitals in the United States, policymakers should seriously consider integrating the roles of these local institutions in the national climate change policy process, and emphasize adaptation and urban forests' role in these efforts.",0.13676995328156313,0.33920132202058684,0.1318240018228722,0.19977101453497148,0.05173125344973491,0.5263242017712441,0.0969119619099121
Transnational municipal networks: Harbingers of innovation for global adaptation governance?,"Few studies have examined transnational actors involved in global adaptation governance, despite their growing influence. This paper focuses on 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), a transnational municipal network (TMN) that has created governance instruments with potential for contributing to global adaptation governance. Despite their different nature from international actors (states and intergovernmental organizations), the distinct practices of TMNs and how they might influence global adaptation governance are uncertain. Vague claims suggest that TMNs are innovative, but what this innovation consists of remains unclear. Therefore, the research question here is: how do TMNs innovate in global adaptation governance? This paper strives to answer this question, by building an analytical framework to identify types and features of governance instruments, based on the literature on policy instruments, global environmental governance and global climate governance. It presents a case study of 100RC, based on an in-depth documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews. The results suggest that TMNs can be innovative, if they, like 100RC, create original governance instruments instead of using the existing tools of international or other transnational actors. While some of 100RC's tools favour a more recent, soft and indirect approach, its considerable use of hard practices with significant obligation is particularly interesting considering the general characterization of TMNs as voluntary and soft. The governance practices of 100RC are thus not in stark contrast with those of international actors. Their diversity could provide inspiration for future action to improve the effectiveness of global climate adaptation governance, and the analytical framework developed here could be applied in further studies.",0.21525345713257124,0.3658864558622814,0.16471535400153045,0.26214580127595716,0.12969478162720824,0.3547486581599017,0.23358134149927487
Quantifying the impact of adverse weather conditions on road network performance,"Adverse weather conditions regularly lead to severe congestion and large travel time delays on road networks all over the world. Different climate scenarios indicate that in the future adverse weather conditions are likely to become more frequent, last longer and will be more extreme. Although climate mitigation measures are being taken, it remains important to investigate how adverse weather events will affect the performance of the road network in the future. The main objective of this paper is to give an overview of how the impact of adverse weather conditions and adaptation measures on road network performance can be quantified. A literature review has been performed to show what is empirically known about the impact of adverse weather conditions on the road network performance. Furthermore, available methods to quantify the impact of adverse weather conditions and adaptation measures on the road network performance for future situations are reviewed. As an example, a case study for the municipality of Rotterdam has been carried out that shows how a combination of models can be used to analyse which links in the road network are most vulnerable for increasingly severe local weather related disturbances. The results of the case study allow local authorities to decide whether or not they need to take adaptation measures.",0.2574148586281429,0.345617075225634,0.10200163617591777,0.2792444848613835,0.05332407499850458,0.1697599521617058,0.09027773109421873
Visualizing dynamic capabilities as adaptive capacity for municipal water governance,"This study seeks to expand empirical research on how municipalities have adapted and innovated (or not) their water systems as a result of climate change. We analyze characteristics of water governance at the municipal scale in Oklahoma, USA. ArcMap 10.3 was used to build a qualitative geographic information system (GIS) based on fieldwork, including interviews and site-observations, to compare dynamic capabilities that lead to innovation in 38 cities in the state. The GIS enables visualization of our digitalized research to understand the interconnections between drivers of innovativeness-the combination of dynamic capabilities and innovation rates-and state of water resource infrastructure in place specific and regional planning contexts. In particular, the GIS takes into consideration income level, the influence of state-level water policy (Water for 2060 Act), water manager certification levels, population, dynamic capabilities, and perceptions of risk and vulnerability to water system change. Digitizing this information provides a diverging perspective on the historical lack of innovation in the public sector, as different socio-cultural, socio-economic, and socio-political contexts occur throughout Oklahoma, a state notorious for its oil centered economy and its climate change deniers. The findings suggest that innovativeness is directly related to dynamic capabilities and indirectly related to population size, income level, and the educational backgrounds of water decision-makers. The visualizations also show that some cities have surplus capacity for adaptation, while others were able to more efficiently turn capacity into water management innovations. Seeing representations of water governance success and failure in communities affords the opportunity to educate citizens and decision-makers to adapt water infrastructures to the effects of climate change, showcasing the utility of digitalization in a quest for sustainable solutions.",0.32046642189729463,0.29888877547960085,0.1481380056423114,0.13569756845676353,0.04861618523759405,0.31592931410813146,0.5396828443049909

"Climate change from the lens of Malolos children: perception, impact and adaptation","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is threefold: first, to understand how Filipino children perceive climate change; second, to determine how children themselves adapt to its impacts; and third, to identify the level of support available at the household, community, and city levels as children adjust to their changing environment. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative study was conducted in three peri-urban communities in Malolos, Philippines, looking at the perception and adaptation mechanisms of children in the face of climate change, using Lazarus and Folkman's typology for children's coping strategies in stressful situations. The support that children receive at the household, community, and city levels was also examined. Findings - Climate change has impacted the daily lives of children, aggravating in particular the ""everyday"" and ""invisible"" risks of those who belong to poor households. In general, emotion-focused coping that hinges on denial or distancing did not seem to be prominent among children; many of them were rather pre-disposed to problem-focused coping as they try to cope with the impacts of climate change in their immediate environment. Unfortunately, however, interventions to mitigate the impacts of climate change on children at the household, community, and city levels were found to be lacking. Research limitations/implications - The selected communities do not represent the wide spectrum of localities in the Philippines. At best, findings from the small sample size provide only a snapshot of the conditions of children living in peri-urban areas. Practical implications - The study points to the need for child-sensitive climate change adaptation at the household, community, and city levels to support the coping mechanisms of children. Originality/value - The study adopts a multi-level approach at understanding the impacts of climate change on Filipino children and the interventions that they and other social institutions have undertaken in response thereto. Findings add empirical evidence to growing literature on the subject, especially in the context of the Philippines where academic studies on the matter remain scant.",0.33393170537922906,0.375032653307006,0.09725595178809471,0.45316668009836253,0.048779321507242394,0.2270003658689065,0.15420167824637057
"""Sometimes Climate Adaptation is Politically Correct"": A Case Study of Planners and Politicians Negotiating Climate Adaptation in Waterfront Spatial Planning","Today, spatial planning is expected to deliver climate adaptation and to manage, merge and balance various societal interests and priorities. To what extent proactive shaping of change is enabled by spatial planning practice is less explored. This paper illustrates how the ideals and ambitions of climate adaptation are manifested in waterfront spatial planning via a case study of Norrkoping, Sweden. Based on interviews with spatial planners and politicians responsible for strategic urban development planning, our study identifies a divergence in ambitions, approaches and positions. In local development plans, the position taken has less to do with climate risk severity than with an area's perceived political and economic attractiveness. When perceived attractiveness is low, precautionary climate adaptation serves as a pretext not to develop, whereas high perceived attractiveness leads to negotiated pragmatism allowing continued waterfront exploitation. We also identify a fragmentation in spatial planning, with weak interplay between municipal comprehensive planning and local development plans, resulting in ad hoc, case-by-case planning. Furthermore, different planning actors are organizationally compartmentalized, creating unfortunate intra-sectoral silos. We conclude that the integrative, proactive and reflexive potentials of spatial planning to deliver climate adaptation have yet to be realized.",0.18588003163291428,0.3763198499220537,0.17161117939444157,0.22837931534801667,0.12459349850827685,0.3591384070315829,0.19202052757930804
The EU Floods Directive trickling down: tracing the ideas of integrated and participatory flood risk management in Sweden,"This study examines how the EU Floods Directive - an extensive and innovative legislative instrument for integrated and participatory flood risk planning in all EU member states - influences local flood risk management in one member state, Sweden. The study identifies that: many municipalities have received new knowledge; cross-sectoral organisational structures for water and flood risk issues at the local level are being formed or strengthened; and the flood risk issue has been elevated up the political agenda. There are also however clear signs that a number of other fundamental issues are not being adequately addressed in the complex institutional setting that results from the directive's implementation. These issues are undoubtedly obstructing the development of a more integrated and participatory flood risk management system. Of key importance here are questions relating to how roles and mandates are communicated and adopted, the lack of coordination between the Floods Directive and the Water Framework Directive, and the inadequate involvement of the municipal level and other stakeholders. Practical recommendations on how to redirect development towards more positive outcomes in these areas are thus formulated.",0.08834092903493646,0.3577148977668579,0.1305711874002266,0.18546431207490602,0.14476245397425513,0.7095950075857664,0.8992101690926837
"Ecosystem services management: An evaluation of green adaptations for urban development in Dhaka, Bangladesh","We evaluated green adaptation strategies (parks, gardens, green roof, rainwater harvest, green facades/wall, porous pavement, and green and blue belts) in the context of urban development and potential climate change impacts for the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Our review of relevant literature revealed substantial environmental (cooler and cleaner environment), economic (reduced energy demand, avoided cost of drainage maintenance, increased land values) and social (higher social interaction, improved mental and physical health) benefits arising from the maintenance and development of ecosystem services in major cities. Our evaluation of green adaptation strategies was undertaken with household surveys in three wards of Dhaka, expert interviews, and our personal experiences. Rooftop gardens/agriculture had very high social acceptance (85%) and economic feasibility and was commonly practiced in Dhaka, particularly among house owners. Pocket park, green roof, rainwater harvest, green facades/wall, porous pavement, and community garden were all considered to be highly feasible for implementation with collective efforts but had lower social acceptance. Many respondents were unwilling to pay for green adaptation strategies even knowing their benefits. Our research revealed that successful implementation of beneficial green adaptation will require public participation at all stages supported through awareness raising campaigns. Enforcement of laws and strong commitment from the government was also considered to be beneficial. However, more transparent cost-benefit analyses promoting the conservation of ecosystem services is required, particularly for resource-poor Dhaka. Green adaptations make cities more resilient to pressures from demographic change and climate change increasingly relevant in the developing world.",0.25058037611609496,0.35830511434472745,0.11704377272775496,0.2836589740139363,0.06032532883389082,0.2783523810831781,0.040082780446607486
"The Indigenous Practices and Climate Change Responses of Ati and Suludnon Farmers in Iloilo, Philippines","Climate change has become a major threat to the livelihoods of many farmers in the Philippines, particularly among the indigenous groups. It has been recognized that traditional knowledge is an important source of information for climate change adaptation, for embedded into it are coping strategies evolved through and passed on to generations. This study documented through key informant interviews, focus group discussions and farm visits the indigenous knowledge for climate change adaptation of the Suludnons and Ati in Iloilo. Since 2003, their communities experienced climate change as manifested by strong typhoons, landslides, and the various forms of crop and human diseases. Their responses to climate change include biodiversity-based cropping systems, changes in cropping calendar, use of indigenous varieties, consumption of non-traditional/wild foods, indigenous warning systems and diversified income sources. Both indigenous groups are beneficiaries of government and non-government projects, grants and agricultural trainings where they learned new farming technologies.

Climate change adaptation planning for Global South megacities: the case of Dhaka,"Megacities in low- and middle-income countries face unique threats from climate change as vulnerable populations and infrastructure are concentrated in high-risk areas. This paper develops a theoretical framework to characterize adaptation readiness in Global South cities and applies the framework to Dhaka, Bangladesh, a city with acute exposure and projected impacts from flooding and extreme heat. To gather case evidence from Dhaka we draw upon interviews with national and municipal government officials and a review of planning documents and peer-reviewed literature. We find: (1) national-level plans propose a number of adaptation strategies, but urban concerns compete with priorities such as protection of coastal assets and agricultural production; (2) municipal plans focus on identifying vulnerability and impacts rather than adaptation strategies; (3) interviewees suggest that lack of coordination among local government (LG) organizations and lack of transparency act as barriers for municipal adaptation planning, with national plans driving policy where LGs have limited human and financial resources; and (4) we found limited evidence that national urban adaptation directives trickle down to municipal government. The framework developed offers a systematic and standardized means to assess and monitor the status of adaptation planning in Global South cities, and identify adaptation constraints and opportunities.",0.13128300131303147,0.45104038417459463,0.12026274828435188,0.2872869816317184,0.1815674156955932,0.6344738676165373,0.150840150111875
Aligning Climate Governance with Urban Water Management: Insights from Transnational City Networks,"A growing number of cities in different world regions are forming transnational networks in order to mitigate and adapt to climate change. In this study, we are interested in the nexus between climate change and urban water management. How do transnational city networks for climate action perceive urban water management? What kind of activities do they adopt for improving urban water management? How effective are these in practice? This study maps 17 transnational city networks that primarily work on climate governance, assesses whether they formally embrace urban water management as a field of activity, and analyzes the extent to which they influence local climate action regarding water-related issues. Our descriptive analysis reveals that the great majority of transnational city networks has embraced goals related to urban water management, mostly framed from the perspective of adaptation to climate change. However, our in-depth analysis of two frontrunner cities in Germany shows that membership in ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability) has only limited influence on the initiation and implementation of water-related policy measures.",0.13768078331264888,0.27142746756529185,0.20108572739595157,0.10473563608136231,0.03615587307942431,0.7523573146791174,0.8359451115445846
What drives public transit organizations in the United States to adapt to extreme weather events?,"Extreme weather events often disrupt the operation of public transit systems, and challenge the capacity of transit agencies to effectively respond to them. In this paper, we draw upon a recent nationwide survey of 273 public transit agencies in metropolitan regions across the United States to understand the factors that influence their scope of adaptation to anticipated climate risks. We find that a transit agency undertakes more adaptation measures when transit officials perceive greater risks and greater adaptive capacity of the agency, or when it experiences more severe extreme weather events. We also show that local institutional environment, in particular, political ideology, affects the scope of transit adaptation activities. Transit agencies that operate in more politically liberal counties tend to engage in more adaptation actions, while the effect of state-level ideology depends on the level of perceived influence from state governments.",0.2857353755547991,0.34720695659373024,0.13094840664775775,0.23403612497973586,0.0989915443233216,0.1963104820028793,0.23211560095033543
Learning with practitioners: climate change adaptation priorities in a Canadian community,"Adaptation is already a necessary response to climate change for northern communities. The City of Prince George, in British Columbia, Canada, has been adjusting to impacts for years and there is a high level of local awareness of climate change. The purpose of this study was to collaborate with City staff and other organizations to undertake action-oriented research with the goal of creating a local adaptation strategy. Steps taken toward this goal included: producing downscaled climate scenarios; facilitating a workshop with local practitioners to prioritize impacts; gathering public feedback regarding impacts; and triangulating sources of information to determine community adaptation priorities. Changes to forests and increased flooding are the top local adaptation priorities, and impacts related to transportation, severe weather and water supply are high priorities. Other impacts, such as health effects and agricultural changes, are also important but did not rank highly using a risk framework focused on negative physical effects. Local impacts, actions the City is undertaking to address them and suggestions for implementing adaptation measures are summarized. The process of creating an adaptation strategy has proven highly valuable in Prince George and has precipitated further engagement and action. Due to the low profile of adaptation and limited resources in many communities, researchers and practitioners must capitalize on opportunities to incorporate adaptation into existing plans and processes. Lessons from the Prince George experience can be applied to other communities as they strive to effectively adapt to climate change.",0.28425582119986476,0.4162856573235989,0.1552301871752335,0.20356492972547097,0.07832845220980779,0.22172646590630515,0.20798676500923877
Institutional barriers to climate change adaptation in decentralised governance structures: Transport planning in England,"Climate change poses governance challenges at diverse scales and across the dimensions of risk and responsibility. Local governments are central to the delivery of action on both decarbonisation and adapting to the risks of climate change. Yet there are likely to be significant differences across local governments in terms of their capacity to act on climate change. This research documents and explains differences in the capacity to act within response spaces to risks to transport infrastructure and systems. We examine 80 Transport Plans across local governments in England, specifically their efforts to incorporate climate change adaptation. Data are generated from content analysis of the 80 documents and key informant interviews in a sample of 15% of authorities. The results show significant disparities across authorities. We explain differential outcomes as dependent on internal coordination, local prioritisation processes and political opposition. The results highlight that there are significant governance barriers associated with differential response capacity in the face of climate change risks.",0.2711911645012919,0.3520961315976981,0.15193358253051417,0.2670734955978431,0.12797752993238534,0.307614368421609,0.12413466013623213
Roadmaps for Adaptation Measures of Transportation to Climate Change,"No strangers to the phenomenon of climate change, transport-related authorities responsible for managing its impacts have lately turned their attention to exploring ways to address the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and natural hazards, often referred to as ""the face of climate change:"" In the quest to identify optimal alternatives that will reduce the effects of climate change on human ecosystems, these authorities find themselves presented with a series of options. Nonetheless, transportation authorities have no assurances that their choices will best deal with the challenges and therefore substantially contribute to the minimization of negative climate change impacts. Following a detailed literature review of both research efforts and actual case-study experience, adaptation measures for road, rail, air, and water transportation are consolidated and related to the extreme weather events, natural hazards, or both that they mostly address. The review is concluded in the form of a measure and policy database, which is then evaluated through a series of performance indicators. These indicators include the extent to which each measure contributes to the enhancement of transport system resilience as well as the temporal and financial resources required for its implementation. The evaluation is conducted by using an expert group survey covering multiple sectors and disciplines (academia, research, industry, and government). Findings are formulated in the form of roadmaps for climate change adaptation measures for the transport sector; these roadmaps can serve as a useful tool and basis for an improved decision-making approach for different end users to address climate change.",0.17649349183534202,0.35800372158411725,0.13204292599846035,0.27171755772285877,0.08920285646217949,0.2951124678400404,0.13787643723952325
Adaptation strategies for minimizing heat wave induced morbidity and its determinants,"Heat waves pose serious health threats to human mortality and morbidity in many countries, including Pakistan. There are various factors that contribute towards heat wave induced morbidity and several adaptation measures are at disposal to avoid adverse effects on human health. This research was designed to examine different adaptation measures taken by the respondents and to estimate the determinants of heat wave induced morbidity. The sampling design consisted of primary data collection from 251 respondents in urban and peri-urban areas of Faisalabad, being one of the big cities in Pakistan, using a pre-tested questionnaire. The most common adaptation strategies were identified and an index of adaptation strategies was generated. The determinants of the number of patients in a family suffering from heat waves were estimated using Poisson regression model. The research findings revealed approximately the same adaptation scores of both urban and peri-urban respondents indicating no differences in adaptation level of both groups. The most commonly used adaptation strategies during heat waves included using plenty of water, and juices, increasing the number of baths, using an umbrella, cloth/cap, wearing sunglasses, and using green sheets/chicks in the house. The most important and statistically significant determinants of heat wave induced morbidity were the adaptation to heat waves (captured by adaptation score), urban/peri-urban background, family size, the number of males, and high income. Thus, it was concluded that the adaptation practices have strong health implications in the face of health challenges posed by heat waves. Based on the research findings, it is suggested that the health policies aimed at reducing the health impacts of heat waves may focus on awareness campaigns on available adaptation strategies through different media sources, widening access to health facilities, and extending swimming facilities particularly in urban areas. These strategies are important policy interventions to reduce vulnerability of population to heat waves.",0.17548221225667798,0.5257943475425393,0.06195121562462875,0.24695722861152497,0.04027480385531622,0.4205382013388883,0.01120211152287546
"Individual, communal and institutional responses to climate change by low-income households in Khulna, Bangladesh","The relationship between ""coping"" and ""resilience"" increasingly features in academic, policy and practical discussions on adaptation to climate change in urban areas. This paper examines this relationship in the context of households in ""extreme poverty"" in the city of Khulna, Bangladesh. It draws on a quantitative data set based on 550 household interviews in low-income and informal settlements that identified the extent of the underlying drivers of vulnerability in this setting, including very low income, inadequate shelter, poor nutritional status and limited physical assets. A series of focus groups were used to explore the ways in which physical hazards have interacted with this underlying vulnerability, as a means to understand the potential impacts of climate change on this particular group of urban residents. These outcomes include frequent water-logging, the destruction of houses and disruption to the provision of basic services. The main focus of the paper is on describing the practices of low-income urban residents in responding to climate-related shocks and stresses, placing these in a particular political context, and drawing lessons for urban policies in Bangladesh and elsewhere. A wide range of specific adaptation-related activities can be identified, which can be grouped into three main categories - individual, communal and institutional. The paper examines the extent to which institutional actions are merely ""coping"" - or whether they create the conditions in which individuals and households can strengthen their own long-term resilience. Similarly, it examines the extent to which individual and communal responses are merely ""coping"" - or whether they have the potential to generate broader political change that strengthens the position of marginalized groups in the city.",0.20134900127934105,0.39687036749072574,0.07763251484879555,0.38880706688170197,0.06578810607276013,0.36764036038536657,0.20873853846267412
Toward more flood resilience: Is a diversification of flood risk management strategies the way forward?,"European countries face increasing flood risks because of urbanization, increase of exposure and damage potential, and the effects of climate change. In literature and in practice, it is argued that a diversification of strategies for flood risk management (FRM), including flood risk prevention (through proactive spatial planning), flood defense, flood risk mitigation, flood preparation, and flood recovery, makes countries more flood resilient. Although this thesis is plausible, it should still be empirically scrutinized. We aim to do this. Drawing on existing literature we operationalize the notion of ""flood resilience"" into three capacities: capacity to resist; capacity to absorb and recover; and capacity to transform and adapt. Based on findings from the EU FP7 project STAR-FLOOD, we explore the degree of diversification of FRM strategies and related flood risk governance arrangements at the national level in Belgium, England, France, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden, as well as these countries' achievement in terms of the three capacities. We found that the Netherlands and to a lesser extent Belgium have a strong capacity to resist, France a strong capacity to absorb and recover, and especially England a high capacity to transform and adapt. Having a diverse portfolio of FRM strategies in place may be conducive to high achievements related to the capacities to absorb/recover and to transform and adapt. Hence, we conclude that diversification of FRM strategies contributes to resilience. However, the diversification thesis should be nuanced in the sense that there are different ways to be resilient. First, the three capacities imply different rationales and normative starting points for flood risk governance, the choice between which is inherently political. Second, we found trade-offs between the three capacities, e.g., being resistant seems to lower the possibility to be absorbent. Third, to explain countries' achievements in terms of resilience, the strategies' feasibility in specific physical circumstances and their fit in existing institutional contexts (appropriateness), as well as the establishment of links between strategies, through bridging mechanisms, have also been shown to be crucial factors. We provide much needed reflection on the implications of this diagnosis for governments, private parties, and citizens who want to increase flood resilience.",0.10254525817816353,0.4384424747881273,0.15383064044842756,0.20411533849407656,0.16015581403433674,0.5627811946736762,0.7558465887345096
Adapting to Climate Change: Lessons from Farmers and Peri-Urban Fringe Residents in South Australia,"This paper reports on results from two major research projects conducted in South Australia. The first investigates adaptation to climate change in two of the state's major grain and sheep farming regions, using semi-structured interviews and focus groups. The second uses a postal questionnaire and an internet-based survey of residents in the peri-urban fringes of Adelaide, the state capital, to examine knowledge of and attitudes to climate change and resulting adaptations, especially in the context of increasing risk of wildfires. The research on adaptation to climate change in agriculture focused on formal institutions (e.g., government agencies) and communities of practice (e.g., farm systems groups). Both groups noted that farmers autonomously adapt to various risks, including those induced by climate variability. The types and levels of adaptation varied among individuals partly because of barriers to adaptation, which included limited communication and engagement processes established between formal institutions and communities of practice. The paper discusses possibilities for more effective transfers of knowledge and information on climate change among formal institutions, communities of practice, trusted individual advisors and farmers. Research in the peri-urban fringe revealed that actions taken by individuals to mitigate and/or adapt to climate change were linked to the nature of environmental values held (or ecological worldview) and place attachment. Individuals with a strong place attachment to the study area (the Adelaide Hills) who possessed knowledge of and/or beliefs in climate change were most likely to take mitigating actions. This was also linked to previous experience of major risk from wildfires. The paper concludes by discussing prospects for developing co-management for reducing the impact of climate change across multiple groups in rural and peri-urban areas.",0.5454664136274275,0.35006876715710944,0.11030987156221493,0.37351049032617895,0.05929877258923901,0.1041103108644327,0.07036786815191025
"Climate Change Adaptation Measures in the Coastal City of Semarang, Indonesia: Current Practices and Performance","Indonesia is among the most vulnerable countries to climate change due to its coastlines, high concentration of population and economic activity in coastal areas. In addition, the impacts of climate change have had severe environmental and socio-economic consequences. Adaptation measures are required to minimize the impacts. Some climate change adaptation measures have been practiced in the coastal cities of Indonesia. This article aims to examine the current practices and performance of local adaptation measures in the coastal city of Semarang City. The current adaptation practices include an integration of climate resilience strategy into city planning and a physical adaptation strategy for the tidal flood hazard. It is found that the performance of each adaptation measures has different outcomes depending on the typology of adaptation.

Climate change adaptation planning in large cities: A systematic global assessment,"Cities globally face significant risks from climate change, and are taking an increasingly active role in formulating and implementing climate change adaptation policy. However, there are few, if any, global assessments of adaptation taking place across cities. This study develops and applies a framework to track urban climate change adaptation policy using municipal adaptation reporting. From 401 local governments globally in urban areas with >1 m people, we find that only 61 cities (15%) report any adaptation initiatives, and 73 cities (18%) report on planning towards adaptation policy. We classified cities based on their adaptation reporting as extensive adaptors, moderate adaptors, early stage adaptors, and non-reporting. With few exceptions, extensive adaptors are large cities located in high-income countries in North America, Europe, and Oceania, and are adapting to a variety of expected impacts. Moderate adaptors usually address general disaster risk reduction rather than specific impacts, and are located in a mix of developed and developing countries. Early stage adaptors exhibit evidence of planning for adaptation, but do not report any initiatives. Our findings suggest that urban adaptation is in the early stages, but there are still substantive examples of governments taking leadership regardless of wealth levels and institutional barriers.

Indicators of urban climate resilience: A contextual approach,"As urban populations grow and climate exposure increases, more cities are introducing formal planning processes to adapt to climate change. This paper explains the process applied to eight cities in the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN) for developing indicators for planning and monitoring local climate resilience. This process relied on transferring a common conceptual framework for climate resilience, together with a locally led iterative and collaborative process that engaged technical and planning authorities and vulnerable groups. The process varied slightly between cities and generated indicators that were chosen for their contextual fit and availability of data. The main benefit of developing resilience indicators in this way was the local capacity that the process built, in terms of understanding resilience, shared understanding of concepts and measurement and establishment of a common platform for future planning and monitoring of climate adaptation interventions at the city level.

Moving beyond short-term coping and adaptation,"Throughout human history, people have coped with, and adapted to, their environment. This accumulated capacity at local level is increasingly recognized to be critical in improving resilience and transformation. Nevertheless, city dwellers' coping and adaptive practices are little known, poorly documented and often not taken into account in the work of municipal authorities and aid organizations. Against this background, this study provides a systematic overview of urban residents' coping and adaptive practices, presents critical insights into their risk-reducing effects and discusses their role in the development of policies and projects to increase resilience. It shows that coping should not automatically be seen as maladaptive. The success or failure of urban societies in building resilience and moving towards transformation does not necessarily depend on the effectiveness of individual coping strategies but on the flexibility and inclusiveness of coping/adaptation systems at the individual, household and community level (i.e. the combined set of strategies). Therefore, it is crucial to support the ability of urban communities to negotiate their needs and rights in order to increase the flexibility and inclusiveness of these systems and make them more viable in today's context.",0.2738481017127905,0.36183227034707366,0.10081103092266096,0.4120529757914039,0.06449562029184638,0.2235660877994899,0.27630802853812547
Negotiating community resilience in the city in a time of political change and deficit reduction,"Purpose: The aim of this paper is to develop a discussion of the production of community resilience to extreme weather during the first years of a new national government, one which is cognisant of the political change and uncertainty, the legislative framework and the institutional complexity that defines the adaptation scenario in the UK and London specifically. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative semi-structured interviews and group interventions were conducted amongst regional and local authority decision-makers in London in the period from late 2010 through to early 2011. Findings: Hazard experience and political will were found to be important, interrelated drivers of community resilience. Adaptation work was found to face a tangibility problem that challenged stakeholders to make the case for its higher prioritisation in a highly economistic decision-making process. Citywide resilience-building schemes were observed of increasing organisational sophistication, and remained difficult to test and largely disengaged from the general public. Originality/value: The paper offers tools to understand movement in the administrative architecture of adaptation, probing the associated inter-agency workings. It introduces the idea of the epistemic ecology to describe and explain the multiple kinds of knowledge employed by stakeholders in the adaptation scenario, and anticipates the impacts of localism and insurance policies currently in the pipeline. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0.39682150247742703,0.410888766622171,0.0960701499442151,0.35562636632867595,0.0721888025547848,0.14175616902335164,0.1384089876111245
Barriers to the implementation of climate change adaptation in land use planning A multi-level governance problem?,"Purpose - In the past 10 years, most countries and cities have published a national adaptation strategy that outlines the strategic approach to reduce the vulnerability to climate change and to adapt to the impacts of it. The existence of an adaptation strategy does not, however, equal implementation of adaptation and the fact that adaptation is taking place across multiple levels also poses new challenges to its efficient implementation. The literature on barriers of adaptation has been increasing rapidly, questioning whether there is a misconception that barriers to implementation can be solved at the local level. Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses the implementation of adaptation strategies across multiple levels of governance by focusing on the land use planning in Finland. The case study examines the implementation of adaptation in the metropolitan region of Helsinki through a policy document analysis. Findings - The conclusions highlight that there are barriers at the local level that emerge from the existing governance structures and cannot be solved by the local level alone. There needs to be a further recognition that coordination across levels of governance is a factor in overcoming barriers. Originality/value - So far, there are very few studies that have analysed barriers in relation to the implementation of adaptation in a multi-level setting, and none in the land use sector, which is inherently hierarchical in nature.",0.273848048296274,0.3498671513048492,0.16861777791143717,0.3380518159005294,0.12623136232372834,0.43125896000195435,0.2573038325239104
Adaptation to climate change in Quebec's coastal zone: a difficult transformation of public action,"Purpose-In recent years, the manifestation of the effects of climate change in coastal zones has prompted governments to mobilize and propose adaptation measures to reduce the vulnerability of their populations. For the governments responsible for the implementation of climate policies, adaptation still represents a novel field of action. The purpose of this paper is to show, via the example of Quebec's coastal zone, how the transformation of public action relating to adaptation remains difficult. Design/methodology/approach-For this case study, a qualitative method which combines documentary analysis and semi-directed interviews was selected. Findings-The study shows how adaptation becomes a new issue in public action for the different authorities dealing with the effects of climate change in Quebec's coastal zone. However, the results show that, as with other public policies, path dependence and incrementalism can be observed and limit the scope of public action and of the transformational processes in the field of adaptation. The technical-scientific approach to risk management is dominant, and the adaptation is not approached in a transversal way, despite its importance. Finally, concrete adaptation initiatives appear to be mostly relegated to the local scale, in an informal decentralization process. Originality/value-This study contributes to improve climate action by favouring a reflection on the consideration of the conceptual and theoretical framework in the climate change adaptation literature and offers decision-makers and practitioners keys to the understanding of mechanisms underlying public action in the field of adaptation.",0.186364940535351,0.39373914056471854,0.11706390932476561,0.1950228219947429,0.12417991119432115,0.6170444702748688,0.05209176566335823
Competing priorities: how actors and institutions influence adaptation of the German railway system,"Large-scale infrastructure networks are vulnerable to climate change. Their operation involves public and private actors under complex legislative and market regulations. We analyze climate adaptation of railway infrastructure, based on an in-depth case study of the German railway system. The case includes a unique set of qualitative interviews with key players of operating and regulative organizations, as well as a document study. Our analysis crucially extends previous technology-oriented research on the railway sector by applying core insights and categories from the actor-centered institutionalism. We trace observed obstacles for a climate resilient railway system and adaptation decisions back to deeper causes, in particular political priorities and values. Moreover, diverging perceptions and the competition among different actors hamper adaptation. On the other hand, single actors who display a great willingness to act are able to make use of unclear responsibilities to integrate adaptation concerns into existing institutions. Our research suggests that changes in technical standards and in economic regulation support adaptation of infrastructure systems.",0.3896410451922526,0.3584302544219582,0.13878247673400557,0.2889788920136805,0.09629721187905642,0.12177646287038363,0.11261775285505231
An adaptation index to high summer heat associated with adverse health impacts in deprived neighborhoods,"Socially and materially disadvantaged urban areas present a group of factors strongly correlated with high heat and humidity adverse health effects, particularly in densely populated cities where the heat island effect extends over large areas. This paper presents an adaptation index to high summer heat whose validity was tested by correlating it with self-reported adverse health impacts to heat. The data comes from a 2011 cross-sectional study conducted in the most deprived areas in 9 cities of 100,000 or more inhabitants in Quebec (Canada). In total, 3,485 people were interviewed at home. An index of various behavioral adaptations was developed using a Multiple Correspondence Analysis. This individual-level adaptation index summarizes a range of 14 easy-to-use and energy-efficient solutions for cooling off or protecting oneself against the sun, both at home and in other places, whether indoors or out. In addition, it shows that adaptation to heat goes beyond air conditioning in the home. People who experience adverse effects of heat on their health tend to adopt more of the behaviors measured by the index than those perceiving little or none, regardless of their age group or presence of air conditioning at home. Monitoring and improving this index over time and in several populations and contexts would establish a significant milestone for adaptation in health promotion and prevention.",0.1772327261059308,0.48378735631231207,0.04866159559534994,0.18297016410849143,0.044059325226436116,0.39585670373495896,0.053145981551890265
"GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE, CLIMATE CHANGE AND SPATIAL PLANNING: LEARNING LESSONS ACROSS BORDERS","Climate change will further induce a generalized rise in temperature, heat waves, exacerbation of heat island effect, alteration of the precipitation regime variability with higher occurrence of high precipitation and flood events, reduction of quantity and quality of freshwater resources, disruption of agricultural production, leading to food security risk, degradation of recreational and aesthetic amenities, and loss of biodiversity. On other hand, Green Infrastructure, that is, the network of natural and semi-natural spaces within and around urban spaces, brings a constructive and protecting element that may mitigate and adapt to the local level impacts of climate change, strengthening local resilience. This paper presents a comparative study of various green infrastructures' implementation based on analytics in the United States of America, United Kingdom and Portugal, and focuses on the degree of its alignment with the public policies of mitigation and adaptation to the impacts of climate change. Pursuant to the identification of successes and failures, this paper infers common strategies, goals and benchmarking on outcomes for more adequate decision implementation and sustainable spatial planning, considering the importance of green infrastructure.",0.20968726343777744,0.4008182238624529,0.09719555155538678,0.18825691809604886,0.058982503105409416,0.43412816530816134,0.10785537805714511
Integrating the ecosystem-based approach into municipal climate adaptation strategies: The case of Germany,"Climate change impacts are a key challenge for sustainable urban development. To address this challenge, ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA), i.e., the use of ecosystem services and biodiversity to help people adapt to climate change, is increasingly being considered as an alternative or complement to traditional, engineering-based approaches (increasingly also known as nature-based solutions). However, little research on ecosystem-based adaptation has been carried out in urban areas, and empirical evidence of its effectiveness and uptake in strategic adaptation planning is particularly lacking. Against this background, this study investigates the implementation of urban EbA in strategic adaptation planning. Based on a comparative analysis of all German municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, it examines the integration of EbA into municipal adaptation strategies. The results show that there is, so far, no comprehensive uptake of the EbA concept. While current strategies differ significantly in their type, structure, scope, maturity and content, overall the EbA concept remains implicit. 76% of the assessed strategies include some kind of ecosystem-based adaptation measures, which focus on enhancing the conservation, restoration, creation or sustainable management of ecosystems, and 25% of all strategies highlight the multiple benefits of these measures. However, comprehensive approaches are missing. We conclude that better policy support and comprehensive mainstreaming of EbA (e.g., through more distributed urban governance, science-policy integration, combined top-down policies and bottom-up activities) is urgently needed to foster sustainable urban development.

Urban Floods and Climate Change Adaptation: The Potential of Public Space Design When Accommodating Natural Processes,"Urban public space is extraordinarily adaptable under a pattern of relatively stable changes. However, when facing unprecedented and potentially extreme climatic changes, public spaces may not have the same adaptation capacity. In this context, planned adaptation gains strength against ""business as usual"". While public spaces are among the most vulnerable areas to climatic hazards, they entail relevant characteristics for adaptation efforts. As such, public space design can lead to effective adaptation undertakings, explicitly influencing urban design practices as we know them. Amongst its different intrinsic roles and benefits, such as being a civic common gathering place of social and economic exchanges, public space may have found an enhanced protagonism under the climate change adaptation perspective. In light of the conducted empirical analysis, which gathered existing examples of public spaces with flood adaptation purposes, specific public space potentialities for the application of flood adaptation measures are here identified and characterized. Overall, this research questions the specific social potentiality of public space adaptation in the processes of vulnerability tackling, namely considering the need of alternatives in current flood management practices. Through literature review and case study analysis, it is here argued that: people and communities can be perceived as more than susceptible targets and rather be professed as active agents in the process of managing urban vulnerability; that climate change literacy, through the design of a public space, may endorse an increased common need for action and the pursuit of suitable solutions; and that local know-how and locally-driven design can be considered as a service with added value for adaptation endeavors.",0.1607951919121771,0.4351411118291431,0.1301955957201,0.25206388375514616,0.08556900970664034,0.56260133594596,0.1489932775624586
"Voluntary programmes for building retrofits: opportunities, performance and challenges","Around the globe governments, businesses and citizens are actively involved in voluntary programmes that seek an improved uptake of retrofits of the existing building stock. A fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is used to understand the opportunities, performance and constraints of such programmes. Building on a series of 20 voluntary programmes in Australia, the Netherlands and the United States (including a series of 101 original interviews), the analysis finds that the majority of these have not succeeded in incentivizing their participants to take meaningful action.

"Coastal protection measures, case study (Mediterranean zone, Egypt)","The rapid erosion in most coastlines is considered a major problem not only in Egypt, but also around the world. The main causes are due to anthropogenic activities and/or coastal hydrodynamics. The coastal zone suffers from sedimentation, accretion, and pollution problems as well as the side effect of climate change. The climate change will increase sea level rise, salt water intrusions, and storm surge. Major efforts has been exerted to manage coastal erosion problems and to restore coastal capacity in order to protect housing, infrastructure and the cultivated land. These problems were encountered with various types of hard structures, but most of these methods response were limited due to lack in evaluation of the entire ecological situation. This encouraged the coastal engineers to think about new types of environmental friendly structures work better with ecological situation. In this study, the protection measures worldwide is reviewed and divided mainly into four groups, hard, soft, combined, innovative measures. The usage and side effect of each type is mentioned briefly. It is clear that there is a predominant approach towards the soft engineering, the eco-engineering techniques, or combination between them in order to enhance the ecological situation. Recently, there are several efforts to apply these new technologies to protect the coastal zone as well as the environment by taking into consideration the effect of climate change. These new approaches in coastal protection are multi used, environmentally friendly, easy to modify and maintain, and efficient from an economic perspective. Previous efforts in solving coastal problems in Egypt are analyzed and discussed taking into consideration the experience of similar cases worldwide. It is clear that the environmental friendly coastal structure is more suitable to solve most of our coastal problems with saving our ecosystem and reduce the protection cost.",0.2192258569584051,0.33136232173781616,0.1298275946820398,0.27387581147659273,0.4575598011799424,0.5380489167602412,0.21454179451736993

Municipal collaborative planning boosting climate resilience in the built environment,"Purpose - A meta-study covering the past decade maps the development of Norwegian municipal planning, climate adaptation and institutional vulnerability towards climate change. This paper aims to explore the implementation of climate adaptive changes in Norwegian legal planning and building framework into municipal practice and policy instruments from 2007 to 2016. The study is planned to answer the question: what drivers ensure increased municipal efforts in their climate adaptive planning and building practice?& para;& para;Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents empirical findings from two qualitative research projects, each with nine interviews of municipal key personnel within three municipalities' planning and building services and an ongoing qualitative, expert interview-based study (eight individual/group interviews).& para;& para;Findings - Risk reduction and climate resilience are still unsatisfactorily attended in many Norwegian municipalities. There is a gap between political and administrative levels in communicating bilateral expectations and needs for incorporation of climate adaptive measures.

"Equity and climate change: Local adaptation issues and responses in the City of Lake Macquarie, Australia","Equity in adaptation to climate change is one of the central issues in scholarly and policy debates about improving climate policy and practice. Although equity issues have now captured the attention of diversity of actors and sectors at the international level, they have received little attention in climate change adaptation which is most visible at the local community level. This paper provides a case study of the City of Lake Macquarie in Australia to investigate how different communities perceive climate change, how they are coping with the effects of climate change and how they are likely to respond to changes in the future. The paper demonstrates the predominance of individual actions over collective action, and the low-level of influence that poorer and disadvantaged groups have over climate change policies, even when they are most impacted. The paper concludes that the known institutional barriers to climate change adaptation should be extended to include equity concerns. This extension recognizes the importance of equity in hampering physical aspects of climate change adaptation as, perversely, low income people are likely to be disadvantaged by the loss of property value. Rather than simply adding another barrier, we suggest that in these situations, equity considerations should focus on procedural equity to become part of the solution. Residents in vulnerable localities saw procedural equity, particularly in the transparency of decision-making, involvement in decision-making processes and the provision of clear and accurate information by local governments on climate change, as being the most important steps to enhance equity in climate change adaptation practice.

Analytical framework to evaluate the level of integration of climate adaptation and mitigation in cities,"Reduction of carbon emissions and climate-resilience in cities are becoming important objectives to be achieved in order to ensure sustainable urban development pathways. Traditionally, cities have treated climate mitigation and adaptation strategies in isolation, without addressing their potential synergies, conflicts or trade-offs. Recent studies have shown that this can lead to inefficiencies in urban planning, conflicting policy objectives and lost opportunities for synergistic actions. However, in the last few years, we have observed that cities are increasingly moving towards addressing both mitigation and adaptation in urban planning. Cities need to pay particular attention and understand the rationale of both policy objectives whilst considering the integration of the two policies in urban planning and decision-making. This study presents an analytical framework to evaluate the level of integration of climate mitigation and adaptation in cities' local climate action plans. We tested this framework in nine selected major cities, representatives from all inhabited continents, which are frontrunners in climate action both in their regions and globally. We applied the framework in order to evaluate the level of mitigation and adaptation integration in cities' CCAPs and further explored the different types of mitigationadaptation interrelationships that have been considered. A scoring system was also devised in order to allow comparing and ranking of the different CCAPs for their level of integration of adaptation and mitigation.

Assessing Strategies for Urban Climate Change Adaptation: The Case of Six Metropolitan Cities in South Korea,"As interest in climate change adaptation grows, an increasing number of national and local governments are developing adaptation strategies. This study assesses the strategies for urban climate change adaptation of municipal governments in South Korea. The adaptation plans and budget expenditures of six metropolitan cities in South Korea were compared, based on the Implementation Plan for Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (IPCCAS) 2012-2016 and annual expenditure reports of each city. The results show that the actual implementation of these adaptation programs varied vis-a-vis the original plans, in terms of the level of overall expenditure and sector-specific expenditure. The following findings were drawn from the analysis: First, in most cases, the highest adaptation priorities were disaster/infrastructure, water management, and the health sector. Second, actual expenditure on climate change adaptation programs was smaller than the planned budget in the IPCCAS. Third, the prioritized sectors matched for planning and implementation in Seoul, Daegu, Daejeon, and Incheon, but not in Busan and Ulsan. Fourth, the adaptation programs of South Korean metropolitan cities do not seem to have been well-tailored to each case.",0.17672301516901834,0.3636409119118098,0.11267704720555059,0.16085841228509687,0.05186124494569054,0.5,0.15260777916513973
Doing more with the same: A reality-check on the ability of local government to implement Integrated Coastal Management for climate change adaptation,"Many countries are implementing Integrated Coastal Management (ICM, also known as Integrated Coastal Zone Management or ICZM) as a means to promote the sustainable use, development and protection of coastal environments. It has also been shown that there is a policy and institutional relationship between ICM and climate change adaptation. This paper examines the relationship between ICM and climate change preparedness of local government with reference to empirical studies conducted in two developing nations, Mozambique and South Africa. Using a mixed-methods approach (content analysis of local government planning documents and semi structured interviews with key informants), results demonstrate the level of integration of coastal management, disaster management and climate change adaptation in local development planning; and assess the state of implementation of ICM and climate change adaptation by selected local governments in the two countries. The paper makes recommendations on how to improve ICM development and implementation for coastal adaptation. The results suggest the need for closer integration between coastal management, disaster management and climate adaptation frameworks; highlight the need for enhanced support for local governments from provincial and national government; and greater clarity with regards to the coastal management mandate of local government (especially in Mozambique).",0.11010439017014388,0.42227333608907897,0.16390322060899218,0.16524283587908273,0.4724004747447628,0.4458258304127919,0.38138759306608905
"Mainstreaming climate adaptation in the megacity of Sao Paulo, Brazil","City governments worldwide are increasingly introducing adaptation actions and climate responses in their policies and agendas, but the speed and success of these initiatives vary widely.. Understanding these interventions, barriers and opportunities for urban adaptation remains a challenge for scholars and policy-makers. In this paper, we assess climate adaptation policy in the megacity of Sao Paulo, Brazil, paying special attention to missed opportunities and potential synergies. We focus on climate policies and urban interventions in Sao Paulo, specifically on the analysis of documents related to the Municipal Climate Change Policy (launched in 2009) and New Master Plan (concluded in 2014). We describe local responses to climate change already implemented in the city and explore some of the factors that affect its adaptation. We argue that although the megacity has recently implemented innovative urban policies and a set of municipal actions that aim to overcome many of the city's challenges, Sao Paulo is missing an opportunity to mainstream climate change to improve its adaptive capacity. In exploring some of the local initiatives implemented in recent years, we seek to understand responses to climate change that emerge in Brazilian cities, particularly considering that cities learn from each other to adapt.",0.2083473352278155,0.3987330873775395,0.15530499337420384,0.22058773247107438,0.042950295757791086,0.5365527451858131,0.12434060915708149
Introducing nature-based solutions into urban policy - facts and gaps. Case study of Poznan,"Cities often don't appreciate the benefits of green infrastructure (GI) enough. To recognise the extent to which green infrastructure and nature-based solutions (NbS) are present in the urban policy, we conducted a review of planning, strategic and programming documents of Poznan City as a Case Study. The study is aimed at 1) diagnosing of current position NbS in the tasks and directions of planning, strategic and programming documents; 2) characteristic of activities related to NbS according to the form of human-nature interaction; 3) determining the potential of including NbS in the local policy; 4) identifying the role of NbS in facing 4 main challenges in urban policy: resilience and climate change adaptation, health and well-being, social cohesion, economic development potential. The results show that a significant number of actions focus on GI changes towards its multifunctionality and better quality, while there are not many actions towards supporting citizens in using it. Also, despite urban pressure, new green spaces are still planned to be created. The role of NbS within GI in urban resilience is well recognised. Yet, the adaptation to climate change has gained a low priority so far. Linkages between GI and the wellbeing of inhabitants are well understood. However, the possibility to build and strengthen social cohesion based on GI is rather marginally noticed. The least recognised is the influence of NbS on the economic development potential. It is an area that still needs to be investigated to bring evidence in this field. We conclude that to support large-scale, nature-based solution implementation in cities, the crucial step is to bring them into the local urban agenda. An evaluation of urban policy documents based on the presented approach can serve as a guideline for identifying gaps and potentials for NbS inclusion. As a result, it can help the better organisation of urban policy and harmonisation of different sectors through NbS.",0.07997942319583318,0.4296625957765445,0.11300445086338191,0.18212789570395274,0.06171454005577858,0.7271553415948033,0.11587216096007762
"Leadership within regional climate change adaptation networks: the case of climate adaptation officers in Northern Hesse, Germany","In the climate adaptation literature, leadership tends to be an understudied factor, although it may be crucial for regional adaptation governance. This article shows how leadership can be usefully conceptualized and operationalized within regional governance networks dealing with climate adaptation. It applies an integrative framework inspired by complexity leadership theory, distinguishing several leadership functions to enhance the adaptive capacity of regional networks. We focus on one specific institutional innovation, appointed climate adaptation officers, who seek to connect science and governance practice, and to mainstream climate adaptation. Our question is twofold: What is the potential of climate adaptation officers to advance the adaptation agenda and to what extent did their establishment and working practice mirror the various leadership functions needed to raise the adaptive capacity of the regional network they operated in? The integrative leadership framework structures the analysis of climate adaptation officers forming part of a government-funded project seeking to enhance adaptation to climate variability in the central German region of Northern Hesse. The data consist of interviews with scientists and regional authority employees and project documentation including an evaluation. We find that climate adaptation officers raised awareness for climate adaptation and helped to shape and implement a number of projects within the overall KLIMZUG programme, highlighting impeding and enabling factors. The process of setting up this institutional innovation involved all forms of leadership functions and is an example of vertical mainstreaming. Its operation involved most clearly enabling and connective leadership functions and is an example of horizontal mainstreaming.",0.2911173330354425,0.3996734666887895,0.1711469686282956,0.2929318828671506,0.13568382476408816,0.1523878810013583,0.22042177931468487

The role of individual adaptive practices for sustainable adaptation,"Purpose – This paper aims to investigate the strategies used by Swedish citizens to adapt to changing climate variability and extremes. There is an increasing consensus that individual adaptive capacities are critical to successfully adapt to climate change and achieve sustainable development. However, little is known about individual adaptive practices, particularly in developed countries. Design/methodology/approach – The study covered a variety of geographical areas and included single-case studies of specific locations, cross-case studies and country-wide studies. Data were collected through literature review, interviews with at-risk people, observation and group discussions with municipal staff. Findings – The paper provides an overview of Swedish citizens’ adaptive practices and highlights how institutional development efforts affect individuals and their activities, including the equitable distribution of adaptation needs and resources. The paper concludes that individual adaptive capacities do not necessarily translate into adaptation. Practical implications – The results show that planned interventions are required. They emphasise the importance of more people-oriented adaptation planning that fosters the sustainable transformation of cities, together with the role that South-North knowledge transfer can play in this context. Originality/value – The paper offers critical insights into the positive and negative effects of citizens’ adaptation strategies (based on criteria such as effectiveness, sustainability and equity), and it discusses their relevance in the formulation of development policies and programmes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0.4828042548050141,0.3671166984589767,0.10393778985827744,0.3790977895262925,0.0873478000879272,0.12763803365259274,0.11953710981071462
Climate change adaptation and mitigation–a hitherto neglected gender-sensitive public health perspective,"Climate change is likely to bring more, hotter and longer lasting heat waves in central Europe over the coming decades. Particularly, vulnerable groups are hit harder by heat waves. A gender-sensitive perspective has not been taken into account sufficiently in scientific studies on climate change and health. This study examined the health impact of extreme heat events from a gender-sensitive perspective and measured gender-specific individual behavioural adaptation and mitigation strategies. A cross-sectional population survey was done in Leipzig, Germany, from July to October 2014. The survey was used to determine the relationship between the influencing factors such as gender, adaptive and mitigation measures and the health burden resulting from extreme heat waves. Gender-specific differences were found for type of income, personal net income and individuals who are strongly affected by persistent heat. A significant gender difference was also found for headaches, cardiovascular diseases, different climate adaptation measures and types of mitigating behaviour. These findings confirm other study results and indicate the need for further studies on gender and diversity aspects which take into account sociodemographic, socioeconomic and climate ecological differences. Taking the public health approach, surveys for adaptation and mitigation measures are needed which explicitly consider gender and target groups’ aspects. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0.26441823079801996,0.529099223461432,0.07949618801119548,0.20131483980639284,0.04473244680164499,0.23295080066801857,0.0692831305259466
"Trust and the communication of flood risks: comparing the roles of local governments, volunteers in emergency services, and neighbours","Risk information need to be communicated by trusted groups, in order to promote attitude and behaviour change. We compare different levels of trust in local governments, volunteers in emergency and relief services, and neighbours, and how trust in these groups shapes citizens' perceptions and actions relating to flood risks. Structural equation modelling is applied to a sample of 2007 flood-prone households in Austria. A series of cognitive and behavioural responses to flood risks is regressed on trust shown to the three groups. Our findings show that citizens show great trust and attribute high competence to volunteers, which increases risk perception and reduces denial and wishful thinking. Trust in local government downplays risks, makes citizens rely on external help, and promotes fatalism and wishful thinking. Trust in neighbours increases reliance on social support and reinforces wishful thinking. These trust effects reflect the roles and risk narratives of the respective groups. To stimulate specific actions of citizens in flood risk management, the group which addresses the desired actions within its narrative should act as risk communicator. Risk communication could be introduced as a complementary activity in voluntary emergency and relief services, wherein older, retired volunteers seem particularly qualified as risk communicators.",0.18402766979765928,0.39548955763859184,0.10477214328854081,0.23748970072492842,0.10717319143541496,0.42684597772470506,0.3679842709758394
What do we know about UK household adaptation to climate change? A systematic review,"The UK Government's first National Adaptation Programme seeks to create a 'climate-ready society' capable of making well-informed and far-sighted decisions to address risks and opportunities posed by a changing climate, where individual households are expected to adapt when it is in their interest to do so. How, and to what extent, households are able to do this remains unclear. Like other developed countries, research on UK adaptation has focused predominately on public and private organisations. To fill that gap, a systematic literature review was conducted to understand what actions UK households have taken in response to, or in anticipation of, a changing climate; what drives or impedes these actions; and whether households will act autonomously. We found that UK households struggle to build long-term adaptive capacity and are reliant upon traditional reactive coping responses. Of concern is that these coping responses are less effective for some climate risks (e.g. flooding); cost more over the long-term; and fail to create household capacity to adapt to other stresses. While low-cost, low-skill coping responses were already being implemented, the adoption of more permanent physical measures, behavioural changes, and acceptance of new responsibilities are unlikely to happen autonomously without further financial or government support. If public policy on household adaptation to climate change is to be better informed than more high-quality empirical research is urgently needed.",0.37650225398683496,0.3674044414197778,0.1128875230592476,0.41403615675954625,0.0842423110695727,0.14031107387567412,0.17670937396843717
Interfacing citizens' and institutions' practice and responsibilities for climate change adaptation,"Climate change poses a serious challenge to sustainable urban development, placing many cities at risk. Climatic conditions are changing to such an extent that the capacity of urban institutions and associated governance systems to deal with climatic extremes and variability is being reduced. New approaches for urban climate change adaptation are thus urgently needed. There is an increasing consensus that local-level capacities are critical for successful adaptation to climate change and the achievement of sustainable development. However, knowledge about local-level capacities is scarce, and regulatory frameworks are often ambiguous in terms of assigning (complementary) responsibilities for adaptation to institutions and citizens. Against that background, the paper investigates the adaptive practice of Swedish citizens and how this relates to local municipalities' adaptation efforts and to the 'interface' between citizens' and institutions' legal responsibilities. By theorising the interplay between the adaptive practice of citizens and institutions, it demonstrates that adaptive capacity at the local level does not automatically translate into adaptation itself, thus showing the requirement for planned and more complementary interventions. The outcomes suggest the need for more distributed urban risk governance systems and people-oriented planning to foster an adaptive and sustainable transformation of cities. The potential scope of action for more people-oriented adaptation planning is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"Governing climate change in Dutch cities: anchoring local climate strategies in organisation, policy and practical implementation","Although Dutch cities were among the forerunners in local climate policy, a systematic overview on climate mitigation and adaptation policy is still missing. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing 25 Dutch cities using indicators for the level of anchoring in policy, organisation and practical implementation as well as multi-level relations. Since Tilburg, Amsterdam, Den Haag and Rotterdam show a higher performance than other Dutch cities, these four cities are used as reference cities. The findings suggest that structural integration of climate mitigation and adaptation is limited in Dutch cities. The study points at three recent trends in local climate governance in the Netherlands: (i) decentralisation within municipal organisations, (ii) externalisation initiatives that place climate policy outside the municipal organisation and (iii) regionalisation with neighbouring municipalities and the provincial government.",0.19401401624012052,0.3445412624177477,0.11113115816486133,0.2498249677044315,0.12242293752956537,0.7091566470145059,0.22152393914640595
Mind the gap! Lessons from science-based stakeholder dialogue in climate-adapted management of wetlands,"Effective stakeholder involvement is crucial for the management of protected areas, especially when new challenges like adaptation to climate change need to be addressed. Under these circumstances, science based stakeholder involvement is required. However, there is often a gap between the information produced by science and the need for information from stakeholders. Along with the design and implementation of adaptive management strategies and policies, efforts must be taken to adjust messages about conservation and adaptation issues, to make them easier to understand, relevant and acceptable for stakeholders. In this paper, the experience of closing the gap between scientific information and the user needs of stakeholders in the Biebrza Valley is documented. The requirements of efficient stakeholder dialogue and the raising of awareness are then indicated. We conclude that many attempts to raise awareness of environmental conservation require improvements. Messages often need to be adjusted for different stakeholders and their various perception levels to efficiently anticipate the potential impacts of the changing climate on ecosystem management. We also revealed that the autonomous adaptation measures implemented by stakeholders to mitigate impacts of climatic change often contradict adaptive management planned and implemented by environmental authorities. We conclude that there is a demand for boundary spanners that can build a bridge between complex scientific outputs and stakeholder needs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Household measures for river flood risk reduction in the Czech Republic,"Interviews with 304 households were used to determine flood risk reduction measures adopted in the case study of the Becva River in the Czech Republic. Uptake of measures was low, irrespective of experience with floods. Financial cost seemed to be a barrier towards implementation, but more work is needed to understand the combination of factors limiting adoption of household flood risk reduction measures. Regression analysis indicated that socio-demographic factors play an important role in household decision making. More men and more children in a household support the adoption of measures. Perception of living in a flood risk zone, rather than actual experience of flooding, also positively influenced probability of adopting some measures. When a house is elevated up from ground level by 1 metre or more, the likelihood of taking further measures decreased by 20%. Further investigation of these factors and why, not just how, they influence household choices would support flood risk reduction measures, especially under a changing climate.",0.3348910556820177,0.30881991568222616,0.11130285448459853,0.2726602598768013,0.09519198508837198,0.5287712925297156,0.843870881510698
Effectiveness of flood damage mitigation measures: Empirical evidence from French flood disasters,"Recent destructive flood events and projected increases in flood risks as a result of climate change in many regions around the world demonstrate the importance of improving flood risk management. Flood-proofing of buildings is often advocated as an effective strategy for limiting damage caused by floods. However, few empirical studies have estimated the damage that can be avoided by implementing such flood damage mitigation measures. This study estimates potential damage savings and the cost-effectiveness of specific flood damage mitigation measures that were implemented by households during major flood events in France. For this purpose, data about flood damage experienced and household flood preparedness were collected using a survey of 885 French households in three flood-prone regions that face different flood hazards. Four main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, using regression analysis results in improved estimates of the effectiveness of mitigation measures than methods used by earlier studies that compare mean damage suffered between households who have, and who have not, taken these measures. Second, this study has provided empirical insights showing that some mitigation measures can substantially reduce damage during floods. Third, the effectiveness of the mitigation measures is very regional dependent, which can be explained by the different characteristics of the flood hazard in our sample areas that experience either slow onset river flooding or more rapid flash and coastal flooding. Fourth, the cost-efficiency of the flood damage mitigation measures depends strongly on the flood probability faced by households. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

What motivates coastal households to adapt pro-actively to sea-level rise and increasing flood risk?,"Individuals are able to contribute in reducing vulnerability to climate change and extreme events. This study addresses the question of what motivates coastal dwellers to adapt proactively to rising sea-levels and associated flood events. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey that was carried out in Germany and Denmark. Two elements based on variables of the Protection Motivation Theory were constructed, which depict the perceptions of flood risk and household-level adaptation. In addition, individual and residence-related characteristics were included. First, descriptive statistical analysis on adaptation behaviour and the two elements was conducted. Then, multiple regression analysis was applied to determine which variables influence the total number of implemented adaptation measures. Finally, the implementation of single adaptation measures was investigated using binary logistic regression analysis. Results indicate that personal experience is the main explanatory factor for adaptation behaviour while cognitive variables and personal history are also important. The independent variables that we used can, to a large extent, predict the implementation of measures that require small investments in terms of efforts and costs. However, the implementation of high-investment measures cannot be explained based on these variables. Our findings suggest that risk communication in coastal management should also integrate variables related to adaptation behaviour, and further research is needed to better understand the implementation of high-investment adaptation measures.",0.2561448204312749,0.35664047769114093,0.09734749474614655,0.22212563907419947,0.24261655675626229,0.39110577870486923,0.31952012296719623
Insights on Urban and Periurban Adaptation Strategies Based on Stakeholders' Perceptions on Hard and Soft Responses to Climate Change,"Adapting to expected impacts of climate change is a task shared by multiple institutions and individuals, but much of this work falls over local and regional authorities, which has made them experts over the issue. At the same time, adaptation to climate change has been a research interest in different academic fields; while private companies provide research and development efforts on the issue. Views from perspectives may contain common ground and discrepancies, but benefits from the discussion may differ among these three sectors. This study shows the application of collaborative approaches to analyze impacts and adaptation measures at a local level. A stakeholder workshop was held in the city of Bilbao to discuss impacts of climate change and adaptation in the local context of the Basque Country. The contributions were proposed on three axes: impacts from climate change, good practices proposed or already in action, and costs and benefits derived from those strategies. Participants were asked to rank a series of measures and practices extracted from their previous inputs. These measures were analyzed after applying bootstrapping techniques, according to the perceived costs and benefits assigned to each of the grouped measures and practices. Participants estimated that groups containing green adaptation measures and those that had potentially positive impacts over climate change mitigation were the most efficient measures, as reduced costs combined with high benefits could lead to win-win adaptation strategies, while grey infrastructures were seen as providing high benefits at high costs.",0.4260597450114369,0.28903109359087586,0.13981958855392387,0.24762179715416205,0.06170131886584129,0.2124540766319628,0.09044904726699825
A bridge over troubled water: A contextual analysis of social vulnerability to climate change in a riverine landscape in south-east Norway,"Local communities in the Gudbrandsdalen region in Norway are increasingly exposed to climate-induced hazards such as floods and landslides. A core question is how community members respond to climate change and what factors contribute to more resilient communities. The authors used a contextual approach to analyze data from semi-structured interviews along five dimensions. In Gaustad Muncipality they found that individuals' motivation to adapt to climate change depended largely on subjective values such as identity, place attachment, cultural values, and social networks among individuals, which means it is crucial that strategic plans for adaptation to climate change at different policy levels are experienced as relevant by community members. While the studied community has experienced heavy floods in river systems and streams, little evidence of adaptation was observed. Instead, they appeared to adopt coping strategies. Landowners may have limited incentives to adapt to climate change due to contraproductive policy measures such as economic compensation for direct losses without requiring improved practices. Effective adaptation to climate change on the local level is likely to require making compensation mechanisms contingent upon landowners showing willingness to change from coping to adaptive practices, as well as a contextualized approach integrating local and scientific forms of knowledge.",0.4572680486365176,0.38467300474091076,0.12672070303265456,0.3801968145000781,0.0933862487485988,0.10305989332187047,0.12062142771550502
The Stimuli-Actions-Effects-Responses (SAER)-framework for exploring perceived relationships between private and public climate change adaptation in agriculture,"Empirical findings on actors' roles and responsibilities in the climate change adaptation process are rare even though cooperation between private and public actors is perceived important to foster adaptation in agriculture. We therefore developed the framework SAER (Stimuli-Actions-Effects-Responses) to investigate perceived relationships between private and public climate change adaptation in agriculture at regional scale. In particular, we explore agricultural experts' perceptions on (i) climatic and non climatic factors stimulating private adaptation, (ii) farm adaption actions, (iii) potential on-farm and off-farm effects from adaptation, and (iv) the relationships between private and public adaptation. The SAER-framework is built on a comprehensive literature review and empirical findings from semi structured interviews with agricultural experts from two case study regions in Austria. We find that private adaptation is perceived as incremental, systemic or transformational. It is typically stimulated by a mix of bio-physical and socio-economic on-farm and off-farm factors. Stimulating factors related to climate change are perceived of highest relevance for systemic and transformational adaptation whereas already implemented adaptation is mostly perceived to be incremental. Perceived effects of private adaptation are related to the environment, weather and climate, quality and quantity of agricultural products as well as human, social and economic resources. Our results also show that public adaptation can influence factors stimulating private adaptation as well as adaptation effects through the design and development of the legal, policy and organizational environment as well as the provision of educational, informational, financial, and technical infrastructure. Hence, facilitating existing and new collaborations between private and public actors may enable farmers to adapt effectively to climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A typology of household-level adaptation to coastal flooding and its spatio-temporal patterns,"The predicted sea-level rise and changes in storm surge regimes are expected to lead to an increasing risk of flooding in coastal regions. Accommodation can be an alternative to protection in many areas, with household-level adaptation potentially constituting an important element of such a strategy, as it can significantly reduce costs. To date, a systematic typology of household-level adaptation to coastal flooding does not exist. In order to bridge this gap, we conducted a series of quantitative surveys in different coastal areas in Denmark, Germany and Argentina. We applied a cluster analysis in order to categorise the adaptive behaviour of coastal households. Coastal households were found to cluster in four groups that we term: the comprehensives, the theoreticians, the minimalists and the structurals. With the exception of households focusing on the implementation of high-effort structural measures, our results show the affiliation to these groups to follow a specific temporal sequence. At the same time, large differences in category affiliation exist between the study areas. Risk communication tools can utilise our typology to selectively target specific types of households or to ensure that the information needs of all groups are addressed.",0.11874389498407019,0.38747002601767866,0.09631592830436082,0.2671161771902641,0.3310835440093677,0.5,0.20606183911157214
"Household adaptation and intention to adapt to coastal flooding in the Axios - Loudias - Aliakmonas National Park, Greece","As a consequence of sea-level rise, coastal areas will more often experience extreme flooding in the future. Household-level adaptation is a form of accommodation that reduces vulnerability to flooding and can complement, or provide an alternative to, coastal protection. In this study we examine anticipatory adaptation to coastal flooding at household-level in the Axios - Loudias - Aliakmonas National Park, located at the Thermaic Gulf in Greece. A questionnaire survey was conducted and respondents (n = 491) were asked about actual adaptation behaviour as well as cognitive, socio-economic and housing variables. Additionally, they were asked to indicate their adaptation intention for the year 2050, for a range of narrative climate-change scenarios. Results show that coastal households in the region are currently adapting in different ways, primarily concentrating on low-effort measures. This behaviour is correlated to cognitive rather than socioeconomic and housing characteristics. In the future, respondents intend to adapt in a similar way, with a tendency to implement higher-effort and more costly measures when confronted with significant changes in climate. We argue that promoting household-level adaptation is an easy-to-implement and effective way of reducing vulnerability to coastal flooding, which should be integrated into coastal risk management strategies in Greece.

Cross-sectoral interactions of adaptation and mitigation measures,"Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for addressing the impacts of climate change, yet are often considered separately. This paper examines the literature for evidence of the interactions of adaptation and mitigation measures across the agriculture, biodiversity, coasts, forests, urban and water sectors, focusing on Europe. It found that often adaptation and mitigation synergies and conflicts were not explicitly mentioned within a sector, let alone between sectors. Most measures, however, were found to have an effect on another sector, resulting in neutral, positive (synergies) or negative (conflicts) interactions within and between sectors. Many positive cross-sectoral interactions involved biodiversity or water and thus these could represent good starting places for the implementation of integrated, cross-sectoral strategies. Previous studies suggest that adaptation and mitigation are undertaken on different time and geographical scales; this study found many local scale measures which could facilitate integration between both adaptation and mitigation. It is important that cross-sectoral interaction of adaptation and mitigation measures are explicitly recognised if they are to be mainstreamed into policy, so that positive outcomes are enhanced and unintended consequences avoided.",0.3618401082312456,0.357709188174536,0.08839336290944304,0.21331755762191712,0.09145757779633192,0.24727865679534827,0.1931172056805482

The Spanish tourist sector facing extreme climate events: a case study of domestic tourism in the heat wave of 2003,"This research explores, by means of a questionnaire-based survey, public knowledge and perception as well as the behaviour of young Spanish tourists before, during and after the summer holiday period affected by an episode of extreme heat in 2003. The survey was administered between November and December 2004. The extraordinary heat wave of the summer of 2003 can be seen as an example of a normal episode in terms of the predicted intensity and duration of European summers towards the end of the twenty-first century. It can therefore be used as the laboratory setting for this study. In this context, the use of the climate analogue approach allows us to obtain novel perspectives regarding the future impact that this type of event could have on tourist demand, based on a real experience. Likewise, such an approach allows the strategies of adaptation implemented by the different elements in the tourist system in order to cope with the atmospheric episode to be evaluated. Such strategies could prove useful in reducing vulnerability when faced with similar episodes in the future. The main results indicate that Spanish tourists (young segment market) are flexible in adapting to episodes of extremely high temperatures. Their personal perception of the phenomenon, their behaviour and the adaptation measures implemented to a greater or lesser extent before that time, reduce the vulnerability of the sector when faced with this type of event, at least from the point of view of this young segment of the internal national market. In Spain, the episode of extreme heat of 2003 has led to the implementation or improvement of some adaptive measures after the event, especially in the fields of management, policy and education.",0.34735350550856736,0.3673926072566868,0.0965111231746733,0.3358669505548577,0.0840384908164568,0.1429482382423582,0.06256795283983697
Consideration of coastal risk in the Irish spatial planning process,"The vulnerability of coastal areas to associated hazards is increasing due to population growth, development pressure and climate change. It is incumbent on coastal governance regimes to address the vulnerability of coastal inhabitants to these hazards. This is especially so at the local level where development planning and control has a direct impact on the vulnerability of coastal communities. To reduce the vulnerability of coastal populations, risk mitigation and adaptation strategies need to be built into local spatial planning processes. Local government, however, operates within a complex hierarchal governance framework which may promote or limit particular actions. It is important, therefore, to understand how local coastal planning practices are shaped by national and supranational entities. Local governments also have to respond to the demands of local populations. Consequently, it is important to understand local populations' perceptions of coastal risk and its management. Adopting an in-depth study of coastal planning in County Mayo, Ireland, this paper evaluates: (a) how European and national policies and legislation shape coastal risk management at local level; (b) the incorporation of risk management strategies into local plans; and (c) local perception of coastal risks and risk management. Despite a strong steer from supranational and national legislation and policy, statutory local plans are found to be lacking in appropriate risk mitigation or adaptation strategies. Local residents appear to be lulled into a sense of complacency towards these risks because of the low level of attention afforded to them by the local planning authorities. To avoid potentially disastrous consequences for local residents and businesses, it is imperative that this situation is redressed urgently. Based on our analysis, we recommend: the development and implementation of a national ICZM strategy, supported by detailed local ICZM plans; and obliging local government to address known risks in their plans rather than defer them to project level decision making.

What is the potential and demonstrated role of non-life insurers in fulfilling climate commitments? A case study of Nordic insurers,"Collective actions of stakeholders are required for fulfilling the climate commitments of the Kyoto protocol. The insurance sector's global influence and societal impact is fairly well documented. The sector influences societies based on its interaction with stakeholders, on its products, business and political stance. As such, it is a critical actor in facilitating key climate change actions of mitigation and adaptation, and has already been recognized as a leading sector in terms of climate adaptation. The aim of this paper is to explore the role of non-life insurers in fulfilling the climate commitments of the Kyoto Protocol. This paper is based on a case study on Nordic non-life insurance companies. The study documents that Nordic insurers are responding to climate-related threats and opportunities in a strategic manner by reducing their own impacts, through their core activities, and by influencing others to act. Although Nordic insurers do not classify their actions into mitigation and adaptation, but classify them according to their core activities, they demonstrate through actions their role as potential allies for nations in fulfilling the Kyoto protocol climate commitments. The study also reveals that the commercial reality of the industry is not the same as the expected contribution to climate commitments, for instance as specified in international conventions and treaties and in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and industry reports.

Local governments in the driving seat? A comparative analysis of public and private responsibilities for adaptation to climate change in European and North-American cities,"The division of responsibilities between public and private actors has become a key governance issue for adaptation to climate change in urban areas. This paper offers a systematic, comparative analysis of three empirical studies which analysed how and why responsibilities were divided between public and private actors for the governance of local urban climate adaptation. For 20 governance arrangements in European and North-American cities, the divisions of responsibilities and the underlying rationales of actors for those divisions were analysed and compared. Data were gathered through content analysis of over 100 policy documents, 97 in-depth interviews and 2 multi-stakeholder workshops. The comparative analysis reveals that local public authorities are the key actors, as they bear the majority of responsibilities for climate proofing their cities. In this stage of policy emergence, local authorities are clearly in the driving seat. It is envisaged that local public authorities need to more actively engage the different private actors such as citizens, civil society and businesses through governance networks along with the maturation of the policy field and the expected acceleration of climate impacts in the coming decades.",0.10569858319756975,0.38879896245405604,0.13593130518019797,0.20525849884847364,0.07806227860301343,0.5795454482651136,0.15417918626992344
"Toward legitimate governance strategies for climate adaptation in the Netherlands: combining insights from a legal, planning, and network perspective","In general, the issue of climate change is characterized by uncertainty, complexity, and multifacetedness. In the Netherlands, climate change is in above highly controversial. These characteristics make it difficult to realize adaptation measures that are perceived as legitimate. In this article, we analyze the main difficulties and dilemmas with regard to the issue of legitimacy in the context of climate adaptation. We conceptualize legitimacy from a legal, a planning, and a network perspective and show how the concept of legitimacy evolves within these three perspectives. From a legal perspective, the focus is on the issues of good governance. From a planning perspective, the focus is on the flexibility, learning, and governance capacity. From a network perspective, issues of dialogue, involvement, and support are important. These perspectives bring in different criteria, which are not easy compatible. We describe and illustrate these legitimacy challenges using an in-depth study of the Dutch IJsseldelta Zuid case. From our case study, we conclude that, from a legitimacy perspective, the often acclaimed necessity to be adaptive and flexible is quite problematic. The same holds true for the plea to mainstream adaptation into other policy domains. In our case study, these strategies give rise to serious challenges in relation to good governance and consensus-two indispensable cornerstones of legitimacy.",0.2211796572227815,0.3873035809413501,0.1483741208005581,0.2780235033951054,0.17727204600462973,0.2550925431089262,0.2964539277808417
"Understanding the need for adaptation in a natural resource dependent community in Northern Norway: issue salience, knowledge and values","For society to effectively manage climate change impacts, the need to adapt must be recognized. At the same time there is a disconnect between knowledge and action on climate change. The salience of adaptation to climate change may be a precondition for action, but this issue has so far been neglected in the adaptation literature. This indicates a missing link between perception, values and world-views, on one side, and policy formation on the other. The article analyses how actors in three occupational groups in a natural resource dependent community in northern Norway perceive and respond to changes in weather and resource conditions, as well as projections for future climate. The results indicate that the need to adapt is perceived differently, if at all, amongst different actors. By drawing on concepts from governance literatures and cultural theory of risks (CTR), the paper seeks to explain this divergence in perceptions and responses amongst different actors, which can help policy-makers understand when and why autonomous actors are willing to adapt. We find that adaptation to climate change cannot readily be expected among actors who fit the individualist category of CTR, who do not directly utilize scientific knowledge when in their work.",0.2755590703115608,0.3820570722308066,0.15913839499196056,0.2808697425735227,0.07174929899827762,0.12101505659973628,0.16923853764402166
The Use of Non-Conventional Water Resources as a Means of Adaptation to Drought and Climate Change in Semi-Arid Regions: South-Eastern Spain,"Drought is a climatic risk with notable repercussions on water supply systems. The aim of this study is to analyze the principal measures for management and planning implemented during recent decades in south-eastern Spain (Segura River Basin) to respond to drought situations, focusing on the role played by non-conventional water resources (desalination and treated water). The results demonstrate that the study area (despite being one of the driest places of Spain) is less vulnerable to drought than regions with an Atlantic climate and greater availability of water. This has been possible thanks to the integration of non-conventional water resources as a means of adaptation to confront this natural risk, which is estimated to become more intense and frequent in the future owing to climate change.",0.705525910315545,0.26887650631021365,0.22222489141413046,0.22519386643210593,0.026836219031920197,0.08658887948852832,0.5766835819902726
Assessing local climate vulnerability and winegrowers' adaptive processes in the context of climate change,"Adaptation to climate change is a major challenge facing the viticulture sector. Temporally, adaptation strategies and policies have to address potential impacts in both the short- and long term, whereas spatially, place-based and context-specific adaptations are essential. To help inform decision-making on climate change adaptation, this study adopted a bottom-up approach to assess local climate vulnerability and winegrowers' adaptive processes in two regulated wine-producing areas in the Anjou-Saumur wine growing sub-region, France. The data used for this study were collected through individual semi-structured interviews with 30 winegrowers. With a focus on wine quality, climate-related exposure, and sensitivity were dependent on many contextual factors (e.g., northern geographical position, wine regulatory frameworks, local environmental features) interacting with the regional oceanic climate. Climate and other non-climate-related variables brought about important changes in winegrowers' management practices, varying in time and space. This ongoing process in decision-making enhanced winegrowers' adaptive responses, which were primarily reactive (e.g., harvesting, winemaking) or anticipatory (e.g., canopy and soil management) to short-term climate conditions. Winegrowers described changing trends in climate- and grapevine (Vitis) -related variables, with the latter attributed to regional climate changes and evolving management practices. Regarding future climate trends, winegrowers' displayed great uncertainty, placing the most urgent adaptation priority on short-term strategies, while changing grapevine varieties and using irrigation were identified as last resort strategies. The study concluded by discussing the implications of these findings in the context of climate change adaptation in viticulture.",0.7825410341596835,0.31040877710018044,0.16257476441191687,0.44916838230649414,0.10488244209877391,0.03012494570951922,0.09371062003106409
Climate Change Impacts and Water Management Adaptation in Two Mediterranean-Climate Watersheds: Learning from the Durance and Sacramento Rivers,"Climate change is bringing more risk and uncertainty to water management in the world's Mediterranean-climate regions. In this paper, we compare two Mediterranean-climate watersheds: the Durance basin in southern France, and the Sacramento River in northern California, USA. For the Durance basin, we present new research on climate change impacts on water management, and discuss their implications for potential adaptation responses. For the Sacramento River, we review existing climate data and research on impacts and describe the progress in implementing various adaptation strategies. We find that the Durance and Sacramentowhile certainly at different scalesnonetheless share many characteristics, such as a highly variable climate and hydrology, and extensive hydromodification and intense water competition, which will be affected by climate change. Although some issues and approaches to adaptation are unique to each region, at the same time, these two river basins are utilizing some similar strategies to cope with a changing climate, such as regional planning and management and water conservation.",0.4001793759977858,0.2625067996377615,0.3107223964160379,0.21177196125095707,0.06824755473532752,0.14794916257655036,0.5942177723301697
Local authorities and the engagement of private actors in climate change adaptation,"The local level and private actors play an important role in the implementation of climate change adaptation. The engagement of the private sector and citizens has received increasing attention in recent years. Local authorities' choice of policy instruments, the distribution of responsibilities and the benefits of adaptation as a public or a private good have a bearing on the involvement of private actors. Based on interviews and documents from Copenhagen and Helsinki, we analyse how public authorities' choices, to whom and how they shift responsibilities, can foster transformational, participatory or market-oriented elements of adaptation. The results indicate that local authorities play a dominant role in providing adaptation. Public authorities steer where the private sector and citizens are expected to take responsibilities. This mix of top-down steering, market mechanisms and citizen involvement might reduce the advantages that a shift of responsibilities towards private actors could provide for the handling of climate change adaptation.",0.25812094871689734,0.3081820618976398,0.1295043652948286,0.24462922429201917,0.10376386557247078,0.31198041826665174,0.06908546806543332
Lessons Learned on Health Adaptation to Climate Variability and Change: Experiences Across Low- and Middle-Income Countries,"BACKGROUND: There is limited published evidence of the effectiveness of adaptation in managing the health risks of climate variability and change in low- and middle-income countries. OBJECTIVES: To document lessons learned and good practice examples from health adaptation pilot projects in low-and middle-income countries to facilitate assessing and overcoming barriers to implementation and to scaling up. METHODS: We evaluated project reports and related materials from the first five years of implementation (2008-2013) of multinational health adaptation projects in Albania, Barbados, Bhutan, China, Fiji, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Philippines, Russian Federation, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. We also collected qualitative data through a focus group consultation and 19 key informant interviews. RESULTS: Our recommendations include that national health plans, policies, and budget processes need to explicitly incorporate the risks of current and projected climate variability and change. Increasing resilience is likely to be achieved through longer-term, multifaceted, and collaborative approaches, with supporting activities (and funding) for capacity building, communication, and institutionalized monitoring and evaluation. Projects should be encouraged to focus not just on shorter-term outputs to address climate variability, but also on establishing processes to address longer term climate change challenges. Opportunities for capacity development should be created, identified, and reinforced. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses highlight that, irrespective of resource constraints, ministries of health and other institutions working on climate-related health issues in low- and middle-income countries need to continue to prepare themselves to prevent additional health burdens in the context of a changing climate and socioeconomic development patterns.",0.2800461580451101,0.46080670585113787,0.13291670159836022,0.3793989827064132,0.06851723755344145,0.1047791596431403,0.08433250093021627

Relating farmer's perceptions of climate change risk to adaptation behaviour in Hungary,"Understanding how farmers perceive climate change risks and how this affects their willingness to adopt adaptation practices is critical for developing effective climate change response strategies for the agricultural sector. This study examines (i) the perceptual relationships between farmers' awareness of climate change phenomena, beliefs in climate change risks and actual adaptation behaviour, and (ii) how these relationships may be modified by farm-level antecedents related to human, social, financial capitals and farm characteristics. An extensive household survey was designed to investigate the current pattern of adaptation strategies and collect data on these perceptual variables and their potential antecedents from private landowners in Veszprem and Tolna counties, Hungary. Path analysis was used to explore the causal connections between variables. We found that belief in the risk of climate change was heightened by an increased awareness of directly observable climate change phenomena (i.e. water shortages and extreme weather events). The awareness of extreme weather events was a significant driver of adaptation behaviour. Farmers' actual adaptation behaviour was primarily driven by financial motives and managerial considerations (i.e. the aim of improving profit and product sales; gaining farm ownership and the amount of land managed; and, the existence of a successor), and stimulated by an innovative personality and the availability of information from socio-agricultural networks. These results enrich the empirical evidence in support of improving understanding of farmer decision-making processes, which is critical in developing well-targeted adaptation policies.

Review and assessment of the adaptive capacity of the water sector in Cyprus against climate change impacts on water availability,"This paper presents an overview and assessment of the measures implemented in Cyprus that are considered in order to address the impacts of climate change on the water availability of the country. Considering that an adaptation framework on water resources has not yet been established either at European level or in Cyprus, specific measures that address climate change impacts on water availability, constituted the basis of the analysis. The measures reviewed are in the form of infrastructural works, policy plans and strategies, legislative actions, market-based instruments (e.g. pricing mechanisms and subsidies), technologies and practices, research, as well as awareness and dissemination activities. The measures are assessed based on their effectiveness, their robustness under climate change uncertainty and their sustainability in environmental, economic and social terms. In addition, potential barriers and risks associated to the implementation of the adaptation are identified. The results of the study revealed that although there is a substantial number of adaptation measures in place that are considered to address climate change impacts on water resources and the adaptive capacity of the water sector has considerably increased, the overall vulnerability remains high, as water demand is still not satisfied at certain areas and/or for certain uses, in times of drought. Furthermore, there should be a shift towards a more balanced and integrated approach on water management in Cyprus, according to which demand-side measures are further enhanced, while adverse impacts associated with the implementation of the measures are minimized to the degree possible.

The relationship between risk experience and risk response: a study of farmers and climate change,"Within the existing literature, the role of experience of risk on attitudinal and behavioural risk response has been relatively neglected. Recent research that draws on the psychological distance of climate change as a concept notes the importance of local, significant experience as a driver for encouraging appropriate response. The experience of flooding was used as the stimulus in this paper, and emphasis placed on whether direct and/or indirect experience of flood risk is associated with different responses to climate change risk. In order to explore the relationship between climate change risk experience and response in the form of on-farm mitigation and adaptation, this paper draws on a case study of farmers in England, many of whom have experienced flooding. Results from a quantitative survey undertaken with 200 farmers in Gloucestershire, England are discussed. Statistical analysis found experience of flooding to be significantly associated with a heightened concern for climate change. Although also finding an association between experience and behavioural response, the sample were most likely to be taking adaptive behaviour as part of normal practice, with factors such as lack of overall concern for climate change risk and absence of information and advice likely to be the main barriers to action. Risk communication needs to further emphasise the connection between climate change and extreme weather events to allow for farmers to perceive climate change as a relevant and locally salient phenomenon, and subsequent tailored information and advice should be offered to clearly illustrate the best means of on-farm response. Where possible, emphasis must be placed on actions that also enable adaptation to other, more immediate risks which farmers in this study more readily exhibited concern for, such as market volatility.",0.5362529525432398,0.3132315697169364,0.08514272432663969,0.2255547022137246,0.035709215560211255,0.11070822285040215,0.11695786994955873

Smallholder farmers' livelihood adaptation to climate variability and ecological changes in the savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana,"Climate variability and ecological changes have consequently altered life and natural livelihood-sustaining systems leading to socio-cultural, economic and environmental challenges and vulnerabilities. The risk factors are very high and the impacts will raise the developmental impediments of safeguarding livelihood security and poverty eradication in Sub-Saharan Africa. Adaptation to climate and ecological variation, though recognized as pressing and necessary, operates in the context of numerous uncertainties and unknowns. Previous studies on climate adaptation tried to identify universal patterns of coping rather than differentiating between agro ecological zones, villages and types of households. This paper uses case studies from two rural communities in the Savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana to explore smallholder farmers' responses to climate and ecological variation effects on their livelihood activities that have emerged since the mid-1980s. Results suggest that smallholder farmers use various coping, on-farm and off-farm adaptation strategies to ameliorate the negative impacts of climate and ecological changes on their livelihood. Coping measures such as selling household assets, migration of the entire households and decreasing food consumption/changing diets can be damaging. On -farm adaptation strategies such as varying planting dates, use of drought tolerant crop varieties, soil conservation strategies are based on farmers indigenous knowledge passed down from generations. To ensure sustainability of local adaptation strategies, there is the need for exchange of knowledge between and among smallholder farmers and formal institutions through the recognition and empowerment of local residents and collective actions.",0.966782143111658,0.2590679455108854,0.10469391775714276,0.7882046742052622,0.040639316892689854,0.013146045281345865,0.05331429241047585
"Climate Change and Dairy in New York and Wisconsin: Risk Perceptions, Vulnerability, and Adaptation among Farmers and Advisors","Climate change impacts on agriculture have been intensifying in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. Few empirical studies have considered how dairy farmers and / or their advisors are interpreting and responding to climate impacts, risks, and opportunities in these regions. This study investigates dairy farmer and advisor views and decisions related to climate change using data from seven farmer and advisor focus groups conducted in New York and Wisconsin. The study examined how farmers and advisors perceived climate impacts on dairy farms, the practices they are adopting, and how perceived risks and vulnerability a ff ect farmers' decision making related to adaptation strategies.

"Response to climate risks among smallholder farmers in Malawi: A multivariate probit assessment of the role of information, household demographics, and farm characteristics","Why do many smallholder farmers fail to adopt what appear to be relatively simple agronomic or management practices which can help them cope with climate-induced stressors? Using household and plot level data collected in 2011, we implement a multivariate probit model to assess the determinants of farmer adaptation behavior to climatic risks and the relative contribution of information, credit and education on the probability of adopting specific practices in response to adverse changes in weather patterns. We find that plot characteristics, credit constraints and availability of climate-related information explain the adoption of several of these practices. In relative terms, we also find that even when financial limitations are binding, making climate-related information available can still motivate farmers to adapt. Policy implications are that the deepening of extension access with information on the appropriate adaptation strategies is crucial to help farmers make adaptation choices. The need to foster credit markets for easy accessibility and affordability by farmers or otherwise strengthening access to assets is also important. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Determinants of adaptation choices to climate change in agro-pastoral dry lands of Northeastern Amhara, Ethiopia","Climate change exacerbates the daunting defy on agriculture in general and the livestock sector in particular. The aim of this study was to assess the determinant factors of climate change adaptation choices in the agro-pastoral dry lands of northeastern Ethiopia. Data on the household characteristics and adaptation choices were collected using interview schedule from a sample of 260 household heads. Multivariate probit regression and descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. The results indicated that 63.5% of farmers were applying portfolio diversification, enhancing livestock productivity, agro-ecological practices, and diversifying non-agricultural income choices to acclimatize the climate change. The model revealed that many explanatory variables, such as educational level, gender, farming experience, family size, farmland size, goat flock size, farm and non-farm income, frequency of extension contact, access to credit and climate information were significant factors for adaption choice decisions. The marginal success probability of adapting non-agricultural income diversification was the lowest compared to the agro-ecological practices, portfolio diversification and enhancing livestock productivity. The marginal success probability of jointly adapting agro-ecological practices, portfolio diversification, non-agricultural income diversification and enhancing livestock productivity choices was also lower comparing to their failure. Therefore, any effort projected to relax climate change effects should gear towards the provision of services resembling to eminence extension, vocational trainings, affordable credit, empowering vulnerable groups, community radios as well as local meteorology. Moreover, non-farm income generating initiatives on top of agricultural intensification through input supply would expedite context specific adaptation to the changing climatic status quo.",0.9693201691139564,0.1814567846777573,0.0996014875955811,0.6586561716770213,0.022532949948280052,0.010488447164687885,0.032530200563598746
Comparison between meteorological data and farmer perceptions of climate change and vulnerability in relation to adaptation,"How farmers perceive climate change has an influence on how they adapt to climate change. Climate change perception and vulnerability were assessed based on the household survey information collected from randomly selected 118 farmers of Kalapara subdistrict in Bangladesh. This paper identified the socio-economic covariates of climate change perception and vulnerability in relation to agricultural adaptation. It was also determined whether their perception was consistent with meteorological information. Findings revealed that the farmers had a moderate level of perception of and vulnerability to climate change. An overwhelming majority (98%) of the respondents perceived a wanner summer and 96% of them observed a colder winter compared to the past. Among the fanners, 91% believed that rainfall had increased and 97% thought that the timing of rainfall had changed. The belief of increase in soil salinity and associated loss was prevailing among 98 and 99% of them, respectively. Observed climate data were mostly aligned with the fanners' perception with respect to temperature, rainfall, floods, droughts and salinity. Positive correlations were found among the perception of climate change, the perception of vulnerability and the number of adopted adaptation practices. Farmers' level of understanding of climate change, vulnerability and adaptation practices could be improved by involving them in different organizations, such as climate field school and farmer associations. It could accelerate the dissemination of agricultural adaptation practices among them to cope with adverse agricultural impacts of climate change.",0.9446049967571799,0.2659380288949517,0.08739787692407551,0.48327811235298374,0.027647509380858835,0.0219026501482945,0.07866205806196512
"Autonomous adaptations to climate change and rice productivity: a case study of the Tanahun district, Nepal","A key issue arising from farmers' climate change adaptation practices in agriculture is whether autonomous adaptations improve crop production and productivity. A comparison of crop productivity between farms employing autonomous adaptations and those not adopting provides an empirical means of resolving this question. This study assesses the climate change adaptation practices used by rice farmers in the Tanahun district of Nepal, their impact on rice productivity, and the factors that affect farmers' decisions to adopt adaptation practices. Adaptation practices used by rice farmers include adjustment in timing of farm operations, selection of varieties, crop rotation, improved irrigation, and fertilizer management. Rice productivity was found to be significantly higher among adopting farmers compared to non-adopting farmers. The findings further suggest that age of the household head, family size, migration of family members outside their village, number of plots under rice cultivation, land holding, and farmers' access to information on climate change all influence farmers' adaptation decisions. This study provides empirical evidence indicating the need for policy makers to take into consideration autonomous adaptations when designing planned adaptations against likely impacts of climate change.",0.9918392232100324,0.13044149486568193,0.04964098099698626,0.573209134575257,0.02189742574962469,0.006184091666454798,0.006677173341017775

Farmers' perceptions and adaptation strategies to climate change in Punjab agriculture,"Climate change is affecting the performance of agriculture. Farmers are the hardest hit as they have to continuously respond to climate variations. In order to know the farmers' perceptions about climate change and the adaptation strategies the present study collected the primary data from 200 farmers from different agro-climatic zones of Punjab. Multinomial logit model was used to identify the factors affecting the adaptation of climate resilient technologies. The findings revealed that most of the farmers (77%) perceived decrease in seasonal rainfall while 53% of them perceived decrease in rainfall in rabi season. Majority of the farmers (83.5% in kharif and 93% in rabi) perceived that temperature is higher than before. The adaptation choices mostly practiced by sample farmers were laser levelling of the field and improvement in irrigation structures, which was adopted by 30 and 27% of total adoption respectively. The regression model discerned determinants affecting adaptation choices were, viz. age, education, farm size, perception on temperature and extension lectures. Adaptation to climate change is constrained by several factors such as lack of knowledge about technology, lack of finance and credit availability and inadequate trainings and demonstrations about the climate resilient technologies.",0.9868892183500514,0.14775468517353696,0.06467796775307366,0.5210903395590917,0.012735939756896688,0.010868622256267595,0.024342590231565986
Enhancing Farmers' Income through Climate Resilient Technologies,"Climate change has direct influence on quality and quantity of crop production. In response to changing climate, adaptation is becoming a vital component because reductions in negative impacts of climate change are possible when adaptation is fully implemented by the farmers. The present study was conducted with the purpose to evaluate the effect of climate resilient technologies on the production efficiency of rice and wheat crop in Punjab agriculture. The primary data collected from 200 farmers from different agro-climatic zones of Punjab became the study sample. The results revealed that laser leveller and improvement in irrigation structure are the most important adaptations in response to climate variability, which was adopted by 30 and 27 percent of total adoption respectively. In adaptation strategies for paddy cultivation, the variable cost ha-1 was less in Direct Seeded Rice ((sic)28417) as compared to non-adopters ((sic)36816), thereby resulting into a cost saving of 30 percent. This large difference between the adopters and non-adopters is due to large savings in labour in DSR at the time of planting, which has been a major driver in the adoption of this new technology in the state. Similarly, the adoption of Zero till wheat among different climate resilient technologies of wheat cultivation saved 5 percent net returns as compared to non-adopter. Data envelopment analysis was employed to work out the technical efficiencies of paddy and wheat cultivation among the adopters and non-adopters. The adopters of the climate resilient technologies are far more efficient than non-adopters. The results of technical efficiency revealed that the adopters of DSR in paddy and ZTW in wheat are the most efficient among all the adopters as well as non-adopters. The lack of knowledge about technology, lack of credit and low capacity building were the most important constraints in adoption of climateresilient technologies. The majority of the sample respondents suggested that regular and more effective extension services about technology should be available to the farmers which might enable them to make farming a profitable venture.",0.9481391333904008,0.17724912429981007,0.054596029750251705,0.5094179285210334,0.02772941580128833,0.022374181600467186,0.030119203817852932
Farmers' responses to climate variability and change in southern Africa - is it coping or adaptation?,"Southern Africa has a history of climate variability, and thus is an ideal setting to analyse responses to past and current climate variability by farmers. This paper presents original qualitative research undertaken in five southern African countries (Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe) to determine farmers' responses and whether they can be classified as coping or adaptation. Farmers were both subsistence- and commercially oriented, operating on a variety of scales, from small-scale through to large-scale, and growing a wide variety of crops, from cereals to vegetables and cash crops. A wide range of strategies have been adopted in order to respond to climate variability and change. These strategies include crisis responses, modifying farming practices, modifying crop types and varieties, resource management and diversification. Coping typically refers to short-term strategies designed to maintain survival, but the long-term nature of many of the responses suggests that they do, in fact, constitute adaptations to current variability and change. However, determining whether or not the observed strategies are examples of coping or adaptation is dependent on the particular context in which they were observed, and also requires a consideration of the scale of interest. This has implications for how policies and programmes are designed to support adaptation in the future.",0.8156007001327574,0.2599030201909589,0.09680580668879715,0.6129875163304825,0.061931477221250704,0.03261736351884149,0.05352344185538702
Climate change in Upper East Region of Ghana; challenges existing in farming practices and new mitigation policies,"Countries and international organizations are making conscious effort to address climate change threat to humanity. Rising fossil fuel burning and land use changes to meet human demands continuously emit large quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere thus causing climate change. The research used Talensi District as a case study to determine factors influencing farmers' adaptation response and the actual practices used to avert climate change impact. A total of 225 small-scale farmers were sampled for survey and 100 key informants were used in focus group discussions. Utilizing the logistic regression model, the study indicated that education, transportation, inputs cost and extension services were the factors with high tendency of undermining farmers' ability to adapt to climate change. In addition, Weighted Average Index used to measure weather extremes revealed that drought and temperature had the highest level of occurrence. Climate change adaptation practices assessed in the study showed that change in planting date, improved crops varieties and land rotation were the most preferred practices. The study concluded that farmers resilience could be enhanced if governments and concerned organizations intensify adaptation campaigns, increase access to weather information, and train farmers on adaptable practices including, timely planting and alternative sources of livelihood. In addition, intensifying government support for agriculture including input subsidies, and provision of irrigation facilities were also good interventions to improve climate change resilience.",0.9684422211811239,0.15276595689716077,0.07089226756166189,0.5957675624148447,0.029427136971059198,0.017775609192677636,0.01262058089272953
Analysing the links between agriculture and climate change: Can 'best management practices' be responsive to climate extremes?,"Rural communities the world over depend on agriculturally-based livelihoods. In the Canadian prairies, access to sufficient quality and quantity of water can be challenging. Agriculture is fundamentally susceptible to access to water during critical crop germination and growth periods. Climate change models for the Canadian prairies indicate, in general, that summer growing seasons will experience less frequent, but larger precipitation events. The anticipated results of a changing climate include more frequent spring flooding and a new climate regime that requires more proactive water management to ensure availability of adequate supplies at optimal times to support and sustain agricultural production. Multi-disciplinary research is investigating, quantifying, and critically assessing currently purported beneficial management practices (BMPs) for agriculture to determine rural community vulnerability and adaptability to climate change. The presentation includes research results from field scale implementation and testing of BMPs, interviews of rural communities and residents, and quantitative evaluations of rural economies, development, and adaptation strategies.

Declining Large-Cardamom Production Systems in the Sikkim Himalayas,"Large cardamom (Amomum subulatum) is an economically valuable, ecologically adaptive, and agro-climatically suitable perennial cash crop grown under tree shade in the eastern Himalayas. In Sikkim, India, the focus of this study, large-cardamom production peaked early in the 21st century, making India the largest producer in the world, but dropped sharply after 2004; Nepal is now the largest producer. This crop is an important part of the local economy, contributing on average 29.2% of the income of households participating in this study. Farmers and extension agencies have worked to reverse its decline since 2007, and thus, there is a steady increase in production and production area. After reviewing the literature, we carried out extensive field research in 6 locations in Sikkim in 2011-2013 to investigate the causes of this decline and measures being undertaken to reverse it, using a combination of rapid rural appraisal, participatory rural appraisal, structured questionnaire, and field sampling techniques. Study participants attributed the decline in large-cardamom farming to 4 broad types of drivers: biological, socioeconomic, institutional/governance-related, and environmental/climate-change-related. Altered seasons, erratic or scanty rainfall, prolonged dry spells, temperature increase, soil moisture loss, and increasing instances of diseases and pests were prominent factors of climate change in the study region. Multistakeholder analysis revealed that development and implementation of people-centered policy that duly recognizes local knowledge, development of disease-free planting materials, training, subsidies, and improved irrigation facilities are central to improving cardamom farming and building socioeconomic and ecological resilience.",0.8511035412582117,0.2403001076756202,0.08460074141160148,0.46399043338972,0.043246524505376804,0.043679154733955894,0.06517145782701528
Private forest owners facing climate change in Wallonia: Adaptive capacity and practices,"To understand and guide present and future adaptation to climate change, in-depth field studies are required in many sectors. The forestry sector, with its long time laps between decisions to plant and harvesting stands, is among the most relevant to investigate in this respect. This contribution analyzes the results of a survey conducted in Wallonia (Belgium) among private forest owners (PFO) and an array of organizations, both public and private, that influence these owners' actions. The objective of our research is to investigate already implemented or envisaged practices of climate change adaptation as well as the adaptive capacity of these PFOs. In this respect, adaptive capacity is defined as ""the ability of systems, institutions, humans and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences (of climate change)"" (IPCC, 2014, p. 2). The results show that different ways of (not) integrating climate change in forest management are visible in the sample of PFOs that can be divided into different profiles of (non) adapters. Analyzing these profiles reveals the influence of multiple objective and sociocognitive factors contributing to the PFOs adaptive capacity. The way climate change adaptation is conceived and implemented by other forest and timber actors has also repercussions on adaptive capacity as some adaptive measures are promoted and facilitated while others are hindered. These results bring fruitful aspects for understanding concrete adaptive processes and are relevant for decision-making as they point out some strengths or weaknesses in terms of adaptive capacity.

"Farmers adaptation strategies to the effect of climate variation on yam production in Ekiti State, Nigeria","The study investigated farmers adaptation strategies to the effect of climate variation on yam production in Ekiti State with the specific objectives of assessing the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, farmers' climate related constraints, the adaptation strategies employed by farmers, and yam farmers' level of production across the years 2008, 2009 and 2010. Multistage sampling technique was used to select one hundred and fifty one respondents from the list of contact farmers obtained from the state Agricultural Development Programme (ADP). Data was collected through structured interview schedule, analysed using frequency counts, percentages, Chi-square and Pearson Product Moment Correlation. Results obtained showed that farmers in the study area were mostly males with a mean age of 53.9 years. Chi-square analysis revealed that there was a significant relationship between secondary occupation (chi(2) = 14.068), farm size (chi(2) = 99.597) and the level of production of yam farmers. Pearson product moment correlation indicated that there was significant and positive relationship between age (r = 0.160), adaptation strategies (r = 0.158) and level of production, while negative relationship was found between constraints (r = -0.173) and the level of yam production. ANOVA showed a significant difference in the level of production of farmers across the years; 2008, 2009 and 2010 (F = 212.7). Therefore, efforts should be geared towards developing and making available, yam seeds and tubers that are tolerant to change in climate elements and weather extremes like flood and drought. These findings suggest the need for more environmental education, prompt weather information and sustainable yam cropping.",0.9659046069634917,0.1745509628266288,0.05274058170735655,0.5920099624728355,0.03523853190886471,0.02084055269568149,0.04571970556889887
Key factors affecting the flood vulnerability and adaptation of the shrimp farming sector in Thailand,"Increasing climate variability, particularly flooding, severely impacts shrimp production yields and global seafood supply. Effective reduction of the impacts of flood vulnerability depends on level and readiness of the adaptive capacity. This study investigated key factors affecting the adaptive capacity of shrimp farmers in Thailand. This case study focused on the largest shrimp farming areas at a provincial level. Data collection was carried out using questionnaires and person-to-person interviews. Approximately 100 shrimp farmers who had experienced previous flood events were interviewed to help classify the impact scales of key factors on adaptation. Five socio-economic characteristics (education level, farming experience, income level, farm size, and supplemental occupations) are important factors in making the decision to apply adaptive alternatives. Currently, the main adaptive practices employed by shrimp farmers in the study area are placing nets around ponds and constructing dykes to enclose shrimp ponds. However, poverty and limited access to financial resources are the major constraints affecting the adaptive capacity to combat future flooding events. For farmers whose farms are located in vulnerable areas and who have limited financial resource, an implementation of non-structural techniques, such as changing crop patterns and altering harvest seasons, should be promoted.

"Barriers to and determinants of the choice of crop management strategies to combat climate change in Dejen District, Nile Basin of Ethiopia","Background: Climate change without adaptation is projected to impact strongly the livelihoods of the rural communities. Adaptation to climate change is crucial for least developed country like Ethiopia due to high population and dependency on agriculture. Hence, this study was initiated to examine the barriers to and determinants of the choice of crop management strategies to combat climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concepts of climate change response provided the framework. Stratified and snowball sampling techniques were employed to select a sample of 398 households. The household survey was employed to collect data on current adaptation strategies. Logistic regression was used to analyse the determinants of the choice of adaptation strategies. Logistic regression analyses were carried out at p ≤ 0.05. Results: Small farmland size, agro-ecology, farmland location, financial constraints, and lack of skills were the major barriers to adoption of crop management strategies. Age, farming experience, income, family size, government experts' extension services, agro-ecology setting, and crop failure history of households significantly affect the choice of most of the crop management strategies. Conclusions: Socio-economic and institutional factors determined rural communities' ability and willingness to choose effective adaptation strategies. Policy priority should be given based on agro-ecology and households demand of policy intervention such as providing extension services and subsidizing the least adopted strategies due to financial constraints. © 2018 The Author(s).",0.9134036578174145,0.21039870592319965,0.06307878702344571,0.7501219333796043,0.045910728680894776,0.023350226954824,0.026615798731392155
Crop Diversification in Coping with Extreme Weather Events in China,"Apart from the long-term effects of climate change, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events have been increasing. Given the risks posed by climate change, particularly the changes in extreme weather events, the question of how to adapt to these changes and mitigate their negative impacts has received great attention from policy makers. The overall goals of this study are to examine whether farmers adapt to extreme weather events through crop diversification and which factors influence farmers' decisions on crop diversification against extreme weather events in China. To limit the scope of this study, we focus on drought and flood events only. Based on a unique large-scale household survey in nine provinces, this study finds that farmers respond to extreme weather events by increasing crop diversification. Their decision to diversify crops is significantly influenced by their experiences of extreme weather events in the previous year. Such results are understandable because farmers' behaviors are normally based on their expectations. Moreover, household characteristics also affect farmers' decisions on crop diversification strategy, and their effects differ by farmers' age and gender. This paper concludes with several policy implications.",0.90056286285944,0.25172937671353207,0.07446243354774863,0.4530173741138861,0.01900112730001141,0.02430384453608082,0.0857322671624145
Adapting to environmental and market change: Insights from Fish Producer Organizations in Portugal,"To ensure the best market conditions for their fish, vessel owners are incentivized to create Fish Producer Organizations (PO), with obvious market advantages for fishers. However, the management of POs is not an easy task. This paper aims to understand how adaptation to environmental and market changes among POs relates to their capacities (or failures) to manage production and market demand. Drawing on an analytical framework developed by the authors, twelve Portuguese POs are compared in terms of context, structure, evidence of crisis and adaptability of response. Results revealed three modes of adaptation amongst POs (anticipatory, maladaptation and reactive adaptation) and identified key reasons explaining different degrees of adaptability in POs: 1) prejudiced market regime and 2) prevalence of the sardine fishery, as contextual conditions; 3) evidence of market crisis; 4) leadership, 5) trust and 6) perception of self-interest; 7) learning, based on shared experience, and 8) collaboration with demand side. Internal adaptation could improve PO contribution to sustainable fisheries management, but it is not a panacea. Official market regime and the internal structure of POs need to change as they sustain overfishing as well as fisher vulnerability and self-interest. The adaptive strategies evident in some of the POs, both intentional and agency-reliant, demonstrate ways to deal with these problems. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Agroecological practices for climate change adaptation in semiarid and subhumid Africa,"Climate change is expected to strongly affect African farming systems. As vast proportions of African countries' populations rely on agriculture for livelihood and food security, there is a need to adapt current practices and develop new climate-resilient strategies and farming systems. Here, we inventory and review which agroecological practices currently implemented in semiarid and subhumid Africa can promote adaptation to climate change. This work was carried out through extensive literature research, plus interviews with 24 experts from different African and French NGOs active in agricultural development programs in Africa. We found that: (1) some inventoried practices may not specifically be implemented in response to climate change impacts, yet they aid in adapting to reduced or more variable rainfall and increased temperature, and/or enhance carbon sequestration; (2) other practices promote indirect adaptation by increasing resilience of cropping or livestock systems; (3) many farmers use combinations of different practices to increase overall farming system resilience and through this strategy can achieve efficient adaptation to climate changes, as single practices normally are not sufficient. Our review and evaluation show that a broad variety of agroecological practices provides high potential to adapt to climate change effects in semiarid and subhumid African farming systems.",0.9094129435944476,0.2155611302473475,0.12967025311515137,0.47014993369746966,0.03677648394556163,0.02105047233567577,0.029842593909002322
Socio-economic and ecological dimensions of climate variability and change for agro-pastoral communities in central Tanzania,"A study was conducted in 2012 in Gairo district, central Tanzania with aim to assess the socio-economic and ecological factors influencing the agro-pastoral communities in responding to the prevailing climate variability and change. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through a combination of methods including structured interviews, focused group discussions and personal observations. Quantitative data were analyzed by means of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) IBM 20 computer program whilst qualitative data were subjected to content analysis. A multiple regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between socio-economic factors as independent variables and perceptions on variability and change of rainfall as a dependent variable. Climate variability and change was found to increase death of animals due to inadequate pasture and water especially during dry season. It was further unfolded that human conflicts due to grazing in unauthorized areas and decreased crop yield and failure incidences are increasing. Women were seen in many ways to be more vulnerable to climate variability and change than men due to their household roles and dominancy of male in decision making regarding household assets at times of famine. A number of adaption and coping strategies were spontaneously practiced across the study area to cope with water related stresses in crop and livestock production. The coping strategies include shifting cultivation, vegetable gardens, pasture trekking, digging boreholes in sand rivers, mixed cropping including earlier maturing crops (groundnuts) and drought resistant crops such as sorghum. Therefore, there is a need to undertake capacity building activities to agro-pastoral communities for increased awareness of the effects of climate changes, and improved capacity to understand and deal with climatic change impacts. Also, training in agro-ecological technologies and practices for the conservation of soil and water resources in order to improve their adaptation and mitigation capacity.",0.9344627260560253,0.21328450448763114,0.11363158971850226,0.6708826390072093,0.028435267413802652,0.014649521445515838,0.12156793732032885
Agricultural innovation and adaptation to climate change: empirical evidence from diverse agro-ecologies in South Asia,"While impacts of climate change on agricultural systems have been widely researched, there is still limited understanding of what agricultural innovations have evolved over time in response to both climatic and non-climatic drivers. Although there has been some progress in formulating national adaptation policies and strategic planning in different countries of South Asia, research to identify local-level adaptive strategies and practices is still limited. Through eight case studies and a survey of 300 households in 15 locations in India, Nepal and Bangladesh, this paper generates empirical evidence on emerging agricultural innovations in contrasting socio-economic, geographical and agro-ecological contexts. The study demonstrates that several farm practices (innovations) have emerged in response to multiple drivers over time, with various forms of institutional and policy support, including incentives to reduce risks in the adoption of innovative practice. It further shows that there is still limited attempt to systematically mainstream adaptation innovations into local, regional and national government structures, policies and planning processes. The paper shows that the process of farm-level adaptation through innovation adoption forms an important avenue for agricultural adaptation in South Asia. A key implication of this finding is that there is a need for stronger collaborations between research institutions, extension systems, civil society and the private sector actors to enhance emerging adaptive innovations at the farm level.",0.5842530102358521,0.31532292907605924,0.11743622438142383,0.48732728690676397,0.06919443086760253,0.07792963967706869,0.13250052574670987
Grassland farmers' attitudes toward climate change in the North German Plain,"Climate change impacts will affect grassland farming in various ways in the future. Communication and knowledge transfer are crucial to implement on-farm adaptation measures required to meet these challenges in a timely way. Therefore, we need to know how grassland farmers perceive climate change and which factors influence their attitude. We hypothesized that besides direct factors such as region, farm size, age and education, farmers' socio-cultural background and their beliefs and attitudes are most important in their reaction to climate change. To investigate this, we conducted a survey with extensive on-farm interviews (n = 82) in four distinctive regions in the North German Plain on a gradient from sub-maritime to areas with sub-continental climate. We found that with a more continental climate and less rainfall and with increasing farm size, grassland farmers were more aware of the implications of climate change. In a second step, to categorize the influence of personal beliefs on decisions concerning farming, we applied the typology approach and distinguished four farming styles. Farmers in the four groups differed in terms of climate change awareness and adaptation preferences (P < 0.05). Yield Optimizers and Modernists were more open-minded to rational and economic facts and showed a significantly greater willingness to implement adaptation measures than Idealists and Traditionalists, who need to be addressed at a more emotional level.

"The costs of adaptation: changes in water availability and farmers' responses in Punakha district, Bhutan","There is growing evidence that monsoon patterns are changing in the Himalayan region, which could potentially result in loss and damage for local farmers. To understand how farmers adapt to changes in water availability, we conducted a study in Punakha district, Bhutan, using qualitative and quantitative research tools. According to 91% of 273 respondents, water availability for rice irrigation has been decreasing over the last 20 years due to changing rainfall. Most of them have taken measures in response. They may, for example, invest in the maintenance of irrigation channels, develop or modify water-sharing mechanisms, or shift to crops that need less water than rice. Of these farmers, however, 88% indicate that their adaptation measures are insufficient. Moreover, they come with extra costs. We argue that these costs should not only be conceived in monetary terms, but also in terms of time investment, social-cohesion and livelihood security.",0.90554455598002,0.21061267858565347,0.15089056050911107,0.3539292653476942,0.04634061689216018,0.07311352200832688,0.4076393702785206
Adaptation to Climate Change and its Impacts on Wheat Yield: Perspective of Farmers in Henan of China,"This paper explored farm households' autonomous climate change adaptation strategies and corresponding impacts on wheat yield. Based on a survey of 314 wheat farmers in rural China, results show that Chinese wheat farmers have a high rate of climate change awareness and adoption of climate change adaptation measures. Farmers' cultivated area, cognition level and information accessibility on climate change significantly affect their adaptation decisions. However, these farmers are given limited adaptation strategies, mainly including increasing irrigation, and using more chemical fertilizer and pesticides. Through employing a simultaneous equations model with endogenous switching, we find farmers' adaptation to climate change is maladaptive with negative effects on wheat yield.

"Adaptation strategies to environmental and policy change in semi-arid pastoral landscapes: Evidence from Ngamiland, Botswana","Semi-arid rangeland pastoral areas have been affected by diverse pressures; livestock diseases, human-wildlife conflicts, droughts and resource scarcity as a result of fragmented landscapes that constrain pastoral livelihoods. In Botswana, pastoralists' adaptations remain insufficiently documented. Adaptation strategies are responses to livelihood constraints and if mainstreamed into development programmes can counter negative impacts arising from ecosystem deterioration. Using iterative participatory rural appraisal methods, this study examines adaptation strategies that pastoral societies in Ngamiland, Botswana have used to cope with pressures in their pastoral socio-ecological system. Findings show a move towards mixed and spatially varied livelihood strategies. Mixed agro-pastoral farming, intensification of flood recession farming, fishing and a network of self-help groups have developed over the last few decades of significant policy and environmental change. Pastoralists have become more sedentary with increases in petty trade and higher dependency on social welfare programmes. As the ability to adapt has positive attributes for livelihood sustainability and resilience, there is a need for practical initiatives that improve pastoralists' adaptive capacity, such as reforming pastoralists' institutions and expanding infrastructural development in pastoral areas so as to enable access to markets. These also include the need to share insights more widely across the district, nationally and regionally.",0.8449778716960659,0.32063853498214223,0.15121068816325198,0.6260781585662807,0.06275817925188476,0.028182264902308955,0.08595465023026888
"The role of diversification in dynamic small-scale fisheries: Lessons from Baja California Sur, Mexico","Globally, small-scale fisheries are critical for livelihoods and food security yet face increasing uncertainty and variability from processes such as overfishing, globalization, and climate change. Enhancing the number of options for human response through increased access to marine resources, diverse livelihood approaches, and generalist fishing strategies may attenuate the negative effects of change and disturbance. My research explores the relative importance of diversification strategies for achieving resilient small-scale fishing communities and cooperatives of Baja California Sur, Mexico. Specifically, interview data and long-term catch and economic data were used to develop an economic metric of resilience, in addition to income diversification indices, for fishing cooperatives. Fishing cooperative characteristics and environmental conditions were then evaluated as possible predictors of cooperatives' relative ability to diversify. I found that while diversification was important for risk mitigation and stabilizing income, the ability of cooperatives to specialize during favorable conditions may be important for poverty reduction and wealth accumulation. Thus, the flexibility to move across fishing strategies given changing environmental conditions is important for the adaptive capacity of small-scale fishing cooperatives. My findings will contribute to a better understanding of the institutional arrangements that promote a resilient small-scale fishery, and therefore, will be invaluable for practitioners of small-scale fisheries.

Skeptical but Adapting: What Midwestern Farmers Say about Climate Change,"Farmers stand to be greatly affected by changes in the climate, necessitating adaptive responses, yet little is documented on how U.S. Midwestern farmers understand and perceive climate change adaptation. Eight focus groups with 53 Michigan farmers were conducted in 2011-12 to better understand the following: 1) what do farmers think about the relationship between climate change and agriculture, 2) what differentiates normal weather-related management from climate change adaptation actions, and 3) how do farmers understand the term ""climate change adaptation.'' Farmers expressed skepticism at global climate change yet conveyed specific details about the local changes in climate they are experiencing on their farms. They were not able to clearly define the term ""climate change adaptation'' but did note specific adaptive actions they have already implemented. The farmers explained that nonclimate factors were of more concern to them when making management decisions, and they showed reactive (not proactive) actions toward adaptation. Farmers noted that any action they take has to address their specific situation, suggesting that generalized adaptation actions and language might not resonate with them. Building on quantitative surveys conducted by others, the findings in this paper contribute to ongoing efforts to more effectively assess farmers' perceptions related to climate change adaptation and to use that understanding to promote education, outreach, research, and public policies to more proactively address the consequences posed by climate change.",0.836332622371416,0.26566001263389005,0.1011306911880732,0.354239558778371,0.04109916345142467,0.03684003796936361,0.07306509893574979
Can warmer be better? Changing production systems in three Andean ecosystems in the face of environmental change,"Andean farmers have always faced high levels of climate-related risk and have produced a wide range of resilient crops and animals to subsist under harsh ecological conditions. In recent decades, changing climatic and economic conditions have challenged farmers in the region. In response, farmers have changed their production systems. The present study outlines some of the risks farmers faced in four Andean ecosystems and examines how they have adapted production systems to changing risks over the past 20 years. Their adaptation strategies were evaluated using participatory research, methods and cost benefit analysis. To date, most farmers have been able to successfully adapt to changing climatic and economic conditions in ways that usually improve their livelihoods. These improvements are largely due to their abilities to take advantage of warming trends and new markets to produce higher value crops than in the past. These strategies may not be as effective as temperatures continue to rise. Understanding farmer adaptation strategies at the micro-level can help policy makers and planners identify how they can assist adaptation in the future and will help point to challenges in the future.

Adaptive capacity and coping strategies in the face of climate change: A comparative study of communities around two protected areas in the coastal savanna and transitional zones of Ghana,"Modern productivity-enhancing strategies (MPES) are considered to be some of the best adaptation options available to communities in the face of changing climatic conditions. The adaptive capacity of communities living around two protected areas (Kogyae Strict Nature Reserve and Muni-Pomadze Ramsar Site) in Ghana were assessed in relation to MPES by investigating household accessibility to human, social, natural, financial and physical capital. Information was collected from 249 and 250 respondents in Kogyae and Muni respectively. A logit model was used to find out whether adaptive capacity affected adoption of MPES. In both study areas, indigenous coping strategies such as use of simple farm tools, processing of root/tubers and grains and social grouping were practiced. The MPES practiced included application of fertilizers and other agrochemicals, use of high technology machinery and bunding in rice fields. The mean level of adaptive capacity of farm households was low in both areas; 0.30 and 0.27 in Kogyae and Muni respectively. The adoption of MPES was influenced positively by the level of human and physical capacities and farm size and location of protected area, and negatively by farmers' participation in off-farm activities. Farmers located in Kogyae were more likely to adopt productivity-enhancing strategies than their counterparts in Muni. Considering that access to the resources within the protected areas is restricted and not legally available to support livelihoods of the fringe communities, we conclude that enhancing access to both human and physical capitals is the way forward for climate change adaptation for these two communities. © 2015 by the authors.",0.8597075450953044,0.31605713634501575,0.10368516929973241,0.6049162793654325,0.09099389821862959,0.01861520711794466,0.03275531661405277
"Understanding climate change vulnerability, adaptation and risk perceptions at household level in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan","Purpose This study aims to investigate risks associated with climate change vulnerability and in response the adaptation methods used by farming communities to reduce its negative impacts on agriculture in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach The study used the household survey method of to collect data collected in Charsadda district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, involving 116 randomly selected respondents. Findings Prevalent crops diseases, water scarcity, soil fertility loss and poor socio-economic conditions were main contributing factors of climate change vulnerability. The results further showed that changing crops type and cultivation pattern, improved seed varieties, planting shaded trees and the provision of excessive fertilizers are the measures adapted to improve agricultural productivity, which may reduce the climate change vulnerability at a household level. Research limitations/implications The major limitation of this study was the exclusion of women from the survey due to religious and cultural barriers of in Pashtun society, wherein women and men do not mingle. Practical implications Reducing climate change vulnerability and developing more effective adaptation techniques require assistance from the government. This help can be in the form of providing basic resources, such as access to good quality agricultural inputs, access to information and extension services on climate change adaptation and modern technologies. Consultation with other key stakeholder is also required to create awareness and to build the capacity of the locals toward reducing climate change vulnerability and facilitating timely and effective adaptation. Originality/value This original research work provides evidence about farm-level vulnerability, adaptation strategies and risk perceptions on dealing with climate-change-induced natural disasters in Pakistan.

Do climate change adaptation practices improve technical efficiency of smallholder farmers? Evidence from Nepal,"This paper provides one of the first empirical studies that examine the impact of climate change adaptation practices on technical efficiency (TE) among smallholder farmers in Nepal. An adaptation index is used to explore the impact of farmers' adaptation on TE using the stochastic frontier analysis framework. Data for six districts of Nepal representing all three agro-ecological regions (terai, hill, and mountain) were collected from a focus group discussion, a stakeholder workshop and a household survey. The survey shows that about 91% of the farming households have adopted at least one practice to minimize the adverse impacts of climate change. Empirical results reveal that adaptation is an important factor explaining efficiency differentials among farming households. Those adopting a greater number of adaptation practices on a larger scale are, on average, found to be 13% more technically efficient than those adopting fewer practices on smaller scale. The empirical results also show that average TE is only 0.72, indicating that there are opportunities for farming households in Nepal to further improve productive efficiency, on average by 28%. Other important factors that explain variations in the productive efficiency across farming households include farmer's education level, irrigation facilities, market access, and social capital such as farmer's participations in relevant agricultural organizations and clubs. This study provides empirical evidence to policy makers that small scale adjustments made by farmers in response to climate change impacts are effective in improving farmers' efficiency in agriculture production. This indicates a need for farmers' involvement in climate change adaptation planning.",0.9459838386509343,0.19991635922973097,0.08762574066527912,0.5471578703897149,0.03142719954585811,0.02132675574495215,0.021583972724586058
"Recent climate change in the Prince Edward County winegrowing region, Ontario, Canada: implications for adaptation in a fledgling wine industry","There is mounting evidence that climate change is already having an impact on the wine industry, with effects being region specific. In order to understand the capacity of regional wine sectors to adapt to changing climate, it is useful to document the conditions that are important to producers and to identify adaptation and management strategies that are employed in the industry. This paper analyzes climatic conditions and adaptation strategies in the wine region of Prince Edward County Ontario, Canada. Wine producers identified the climate variables most important to their operations and described strategies they use to manage climate-related conditions. The identified variables were analyzed for trends over the study period 1987-2011, and interview data were analyzed in order to categorize adaptive strategies. Results indicate that the wine sector is very sensitive to climate, and the region is already experiencing the effects of climate change, especially with regard to increasing growing season mean minimum daily temperatures, increasing total summer rainfall, and later onset of fall frosts. Adaptive strategies employed by producers are largely learned though collaborative efforts and trial and error. The adaptations are mostly tactical and reactive in the short term, but with continued climate change, these strategies may develop into strategic, anticipatory measures. Climate change has the potential to present both challenges and opportunities to Prince Edward County wine producers, and adaptations will continue to require strong networking and collaborative efforts.",0.785165910367798,0.28827687261270063,0.15159614905194072,0.44658013055186246,0.07661428279304985,0.05162644854057574,0.06266348489454777
How can irrigated agriculture adapt to climate change? Insights from the Guadiana Basin in Spain,"Climate change is already affecting many natural systems and human environments worldwide, like the semiarid Guadiana Basin in Spain. This paper illustrates a systematic analysis of climate change adaptation in the Guadiana irrigation farming region. The study applies a solution-oriented diagnostic framework structured along a series of sequential analytical steps. An initial stage integrates economic and hydrologic modeling to evaluate the effects of climate change on the agriculture and water sectors. Next, adaptation measures are identified and prioritized through a stakeholder-based multi-criteria analysis. Finally, a social network analysis identifies key actors and their relationships in climate change adaptation. The study shows that under a severe climate change scenario, water availability could be substantially decreased and drought occurrence will augment. In consequence, farmers will adapt their crops to a lesser amount of water and income gains will diminish, particularly for smallholder farms. Among the various adaptation measures considered, those related to private farming (new crop varieties and modern irrigation technologies) are ranked highest, whereas public-funded hard measures (reservoirs) are lowest and public soft measures (insurance) are ranked middle. In addition, stakeholders highlighted that the most relevant criteria for selecting adaptation plans are environmental protection, financial feasibility and employment creation. Nonetheless, the social network analysis evidenced the need to strengthen the links among the different stakeholder groups to facilitate the implementation of adaptation processes. In sum, the diagnostic framework applied in this research can be considered a valuable tool for guiding and supporting decision making in climate change adaptation and communicating scientific results.",0.6029429801417202,0.24888218220365968,0.15947362727353523,0.2588104520668318,0.05973072370939899,0.14886882970710205,0.24642728140287776
Extreme vulnerability of smallholder farmers to agricultural risks and climate change in Madagascar,"Across the tropics, smallholder farmers already face numerous risks to agricultural production. Climate change is expected to disproportionately affect smallholder farmers and make their livelihoods even more precarious; however, there is limited information on their overall vulnerability and adaptation needs. We conducted surveys of 600 households in Madagascar to characterize the vulnerability of smallholder farmers, identify how farmers cope with risks and explore what strategies are needed to help them adapt to climate change. Malagasy farmers are particularly vulnerable to any shocks to their agricultural system owing to their high dependence on agriculture for their livelihoods, chronic food insecurity, physical isolation and lack of access to formal safety nets. Farmers are frequently exposed to pest and disease outbreaks and extreme weather events (particularly cyclones), which cause significant crop and income losses and exacerbate food insecurity. Although farmers use a variety of risk-coping strategies, these are insufficient to prevent them from remaining food insecure. Few farmers have adjusted their farming strategies in response to climate change, owing to limited resources and capacity. Urgent technical, financial and institutional support is needed to improve the agricultural production and food security of Malagasy farmers and make their livelihoods resilient to climate change.",0.9873683509965296,0.1721695834004375,0.07502030350307534,0.6576445043305771,0.0231385123827511,0.006287885062853857,0.010204135463215065
Impact of the methods of groundwater access on irrigation and crop yield in the North China Plain Does climate matter?,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is: to track the methods by which farmers access groundwater for irrigation in the North China Plain (NCP); to explore whether climate factors influence farmers' decisions on the methods of groundwater access for irrigation; and to examine whether the amount of groundwater use for irrigation and crop yield systematically differ across groups of farmers using various methods of groundwater access, and how climate factors affect them. Design/methodology/approach - Descriptive statistical analysis and econometric models are used on household survey data collected over several years and county-level climate data. Findings - Over the past few decades, a significant share of farmers have switched the methods of groundwater access from collective tubewells to own tubewells or groundwater markets. Farmers who bought water from groundwater markets applied less water to wheat plots than those who had their own tubewells. However, wheat yield was not negatively affected. Both average climate conditions and long-term variations were found to be related to farmers' choice of methods of groundwater access for irrigation. More frequent droughts and increasingly volatile temperatures both increased the likelihood of farmers gaining groundwater irrigation from markets. Originality/value - The analysis results suggest farmers are using groundwater markets to help them adapt to climate change. Applying empirical analysis to identify the impact of the methods by which farmers access groundwater for irrigation on the amount of groundwater use and crop yield will help policy makers design reasonable adaptation policies for the NCP.",0.9426678088934785,0.14455097567716735,0.07177068940615872,0.4500426219444401,0.014444988908224035,0.034937116978441984,0.1398521209320399
The implications of group norms for adaptation in collectively managed agricultural systems: evidence from Sri Lankan paddy farmers,"A growing literature seeks to explore the factors shaping adaptation to climate change. In collectively managed common pool resource systems, there is often a tension between behavior that benefits the individual and actions that benefit a larger group. Resource users in sustainable systems must therefore work together to ensure outcomes that are beneficial to the group as a whole. However, in the face of changing social, political, and environmental conditions, community norms may change, leading to the emerging of new behavioral patterns. Understanding when and why people decide to act in ways that benefit the group as a whole can help policy makers better target policies or change incentives to promote desired outcomes. This research seeks to build on research in common pool resource management and multilevel selection to understand how and why collective pressures shape individual adaptation behavior. Using qualitative data from in-depth interviews of farmers in Sri Lanka, this study confirms that collective management practices in Sri Lankan irrigation systems significantly influence farmer's potential adaption behaviors. Based on farmer's explanations of their own behavior, we hypothesize that farmer's belief in the ecological necessity of cooperation and explicit government support for collective action are important drivers of collective action. Given the influence of community rules and norms, we conclude that efforts at adaptation are more likely to be successful if they target farmer organizations and communities as a whole rather than individual farmers.",0.5830592055335874,0.30788220325583343,0.21427197423234154,0.31800853845353194,0.0928336693184488,0.06801932957027905,0.13591451064139481
Drought Adaptation and Coping Strategies Among the Turkana Pastoralists of Northern Kenya,"This study highlights drought characteristics and the many responses to drought stresses employed by Turkana pastoralists of northwestern Kenya. Multiple data sources, including socioeconomic interviews with 302 households, focus group discussions, and informal interviews with pastoralists were used to capture various aspects of drought and drought adaptation and coping practices. Standardized precipitation index derived from long-term rainfall data obtained from the Kenya Meteorological Service was used to quantify different degrees of drought intensity between 1950 and 2012. Results revealed that extreme drought events were increasingly frequent, and have impacted negatively on pastoral livelihoods. In order to adapt to or cope with climatic anomalies, households are using a variety of strategies. In addition to the traditional short-term coping mechanisms, the long-term adaptation strategies used include diversification of livelihood sources; livestock mobility to track forage and water resources; diversification of herd composition to benefit from the varied drought and disease tolerance, as well as fecundity of diverse livestock species; and sending children to school for formal education as a long term investment expected to pay back through income from employment. Policies and development interventions that reduce risks, diminish livelihood constraints, and expand opportunities for increased household resilience to drought are critical complements to the existing pastoral strategies.",0.9216016231974794,0.2827325766730346,0.0677978461808059,0.742115870039478,0.022440416217587335,0.015228070802959862,0.27660636729944266
Optimising seed portfolios to cope ex ante with risks from bad weather: evidence from a recent maize farmer survey in China,"Using 4-year panel data collected from surveying 640 farmers from leading maize producing provinces in China, this study analyses how maize farmers cope with anticipated risks from bad weather by strategically adjusting variety portfolios, with particular interest in farmers' strategies in choosing and combining new and old varieties. While diversification was commonly demonstrated to be an effective means to reduce risk in most previous studies, our empirical results indicate that, in facing anticipated risks from bad weather, Chinese maize farmers tend to use fewer new varieties and allocate more land to old varieties. The lack of knowledge about weather tolerance of new varieties might be the major reason for this practice. As new varieties often have higher yield potential relative to old varieties due to technological progress, this finding suggests that Chinese maize farmers might be trading yield potential against risk reduction from bad weather. Furthermore, this study shows that maize farmers' variety adoption is significantly related to farmers' land conditions as well as their access to credit markets and technique extensions, suggesting that a well-designed policy intervention could offset or partially offset the anticipation of adverse weather impacts on farmers' variety choices and therefore on maize production.",0.9601895440257087,0.13283714843939,0.05905688635072588,0.40628458106372783,0.02421697360141416,0.01897560487002903,0.010525237708153548
"Influence of livelihood assets, experienced shocks and perceived risks on smallholder coffee farming practices in Peru.","Smallholder farmers might adopt different farming practices to cope with multiple stressors depending on their livelihood assets, and with varying environmental and economic outcomes. Ongoing global change is triggering stronger and different stressors that threaten conventional farming practices; however, this could be resolved if livelihood assets that drive decision making are actionable and thus can be modified. This study assessed the influence of farmers' livelihood assets, risk perception, and shocks on the choice of non-conventional farming practices for smallholder coffee farmers in San Martin, Peru. Using household survey data, we collected data on 162 coffee plantations along an elevation gradient. We operationalized the sustainable livelihoods framework for the adoption of shade and input coffee farming strategies and explored farmers' motives to change them. Despite associated high risks with pest and disease pressure, coffee price volatility and climate change, these risks did not explain the current shade and input farming strategies. While in the past five years, farmers adapted shade and input management in response to pest and disease and climate change pressures, these occurred in diverging directions: we found higher human and social assets associated with higher shade levels, and a trend for higher physical and financial assets associated with higher input use. These findings illustrate that two main factors affect decisions on farming practices related to shade and input management and they relate to different livelihood capitals. This suggests a potential for conflicting decision-making, push-and-pulling decisions in different directions. Further the disconnect between livelihood assets and perceptions suggests that perception of risk and shocks might not be sufficient to motivate decision making under changing conditions. Such insights in decision-making typologies and drivers can inform the development of farming practices that enhance resilience and sustainability of smallholder coffee production in Peru and elsewhere in the tropics.

Empirical analysis of factors influencing farmers crop insurance decisions in Pakistan: Evidence from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,"Pakistan is the world's most susceptible country to extreme climatic events, such as floods. As such, for many years, the country has faced the risk of losses from natural calamities without crop insurance. However, in recent years, the national government has undertaken crop insurance initiatives in Pakistan. Consequently, there is limited knowledge available on the adoption of crop insurance in Pakistan. To fill this gap, this study aims to examine the factors influencing the adoption of crop insurance as a risk management strategy by Pakistani farmers. Primary data were collected from 400 farm households through a structured questionnaire in four flood prone districts of the northwestern regions (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). A probit model was used to analyze the relationships among dependent and independent variables. Risk attitude and risk perception of floods for each farm household were calculated and used as independent variables. Age, farming experience, education level, risk perception of floods, land ownership status, landholding size, access to credit, access to information sources, agricultural extension services, and distance from river were significantly associated with farm households' decisions to purchase crop insurance. The findings of this study are expected to guide government, insurance companies, and policymakers in implementing crop insurance. Further the government should subsidize and frame a crop insurance policy and awareness about crop insurance should be improved for betterment of small farmers.",0.9075730432065857,0.2066056245006119,0.05272144322420269,0.5512718608413694,0.05904953800435191,0.03682720215848631,0.13966999274976571
Adaptation Strategies of Andean Pastoralist Households to Both Climate and Non-Climate Changes,"Pastoralist households in the Andes have always had to cope with climate uncertainty. Recently, however, due to a combination of a weak asset base, large inequalities in land and livestock access, and the prevalence of multiple non-climate-related stressors, they are being pushed beyond their range of adaptability. However, the complex, forward-looking and site-specific features of these adaptation strategies remain insufficiently addressed. This article identifies the diverse adaptation trajectories pursued by pastoralist households in the Central Andes. Accumulation of livestock and adherence to the traditional economy are the strategies most often followed by wealthier households, while less well-off households seek further integration into the market economy and asset diversification. Measures aimed at promoting textile manufacturing, favouring the preservation of certain grassland areas, and reducing land fragmentation, seem particularly appropriate for enhancing the livelihoods of Andean pastoralist households.",0.7624376308309234,0.3008492081979829,0.12405693251022466,0.6804971073288838,0.10882932784699435,0.06497329655102824,0.060612149718161215
Climate change adaptation strategies and food productivity in Nepal: a counterfactual analysis,"It is widely accepted that climate change is having significant effects on global agriculture. However, the precise impacts depend to a large degree on the nature of adaptations which take place. But, little is known about whether adaptation practices adopted by farmers in less-developed countries support farm productivity. To this end, this study first identifies the actual adaptation practices adopted by farming households. This is done by linking farmers' perception of changes in local climatic conditions, its impact on agricultural production, and the adjustments they have made in response to climate change impacts. Simultaneous equation models are then employed together with the endogenous switching regression methodology to examine the factors that influence farmers' decisions to adopt different climate change adaptation strategies. How the adoption of these strategies impact food productivity is also examined. Based on a survey of 720 farming households in Nepal, our results show that adoption of adaptation strategies has significantly increased food productivity. Among the adaptation strategies, soil and water management are shown to have the largest impact on food productivity followed by adjustments to the timing of farm operations and crop and varietal adjustment. Factors influencing adoption of adaptation strategies include age and education of the household head (the decision-maker of adaptation strategies), family size, households' distance to market, farmers' association with agricultural-related institutions, number of farm plots under cultivation, past climate change experience, access to climate information, belief in climate change, and attitudes towards adaptation. The findings of this study provide insights into designing agricultural adaptation strategies and integrating them in climate change programs and policies.",0.9899398203046519,0.17038015191499029,0.05964220688718777,0.7155025438493672,0.016758937895612322,0.010476912701393814,0.027313745325871455
Resilience of traditional rice-dominated agricultural communities to precipitation variability in the North China Plain,"This study used the concept of resilience as a framework to explore the response of a traditional rice-dominated agricultural society to past climatic variability in the Hai River Basin, North China Plain. In agriculture-based communities, the performance of resilience refers to the functions of cropping and water systems and the flexibility to respond to an uncertain climate. With limited water inflow, the responses to the recent historical precipitation variability in this case study demonstrated that the local people were adjusting to both interannual variability and extreme drought through their collective and individual actions. In the short term, the local people coped by adjusting the planting area and individually switching from planting paddy rice to less water-intensive crops in order to adapt to a severe, continuing drought. However, because of poor management of the water system by community leaders and the lack of an adequate budget for the collective action of rice cropping, the shift in land use to rice cropping as an adaptation to the recent increased precipitation was not usually reversible. In the long term, the agricultural production of most villages became less resilient to current precipitation variability, despite the intention of most villagers to change the current cropping system to improve their low household staple food self-sufficiency. This study indicated that over the long term the social resilience and adaptive capacity of agricultural communities and their associated stakeholders must be built on and enhanced to better cope with the constraints and opportunities of current climate variability. New institutional arrangements, including collective irrigation regimes and community leadership capabilities, are required to build social resilience and to enhance adaptive capacity for future uncertainties.",0.9289587914389984,0.28178340640110466,0.152539748443836,0.4144121225896958,0.04114401103994378,0.0335783034685079,0.2005631643075169
"Understanding the causes and consequences of differential decision-making in adaptation research: Adapting to a delayed monsoon onset in Gujarat, India","Weather variability poses numerous risks to agricultural communities, yet farmers may be able to reduce some of these risks by adapting their cropping practices to better suit changes in weather. However, not all farmers respond to weather variability in the same way. To better identify the causes and consequences of this heterogeneous decision-making, we develop a framework that identifies (1) which socio-economic and biophysical factors are associated with heterogeneous cropping decisions in response to weather variability and (2) which cropping strategies are the most adaptive, considering economic outcomes (e.g., yields and profits). This framework aims to understand how, why, and how effectively farmers adapt to current weather variability; these findings, in turn, may contribute to a more mechanistic and predictive understanding of individual-level adaptation to future climate variability and change. To illustrate this framework, we assessed how 779 farmers responded to delayed monsoon onset in fifteen villages in Gujarat, India during the 2011 growing season, when the monsoon onset was delayed by three weeks. We found that farmers adopted a variety of strategies to cope with delayed monsoon onset, including increasing irrigation use, switching to more drought-tolerant crops, and/or delaying sowing. We found that farmers' access to and choice of strategies varied with their assets, irrigation access, perceptions of weather, and risk aversion. Richer farmers with more irrigation access used high levels of irrigation, and this strategy was associated with the highest yields in our survey sample. Poorer farmers with less secure access to irrigation were more likely to push back planting dates or switch crop type, and economic data suggest that these strategies were beneficial for those who did not have secure access to irrigation. Interestingly, after controlling for assets and irrigation access, we found that cognitive factors, such as beliefs that the monsoon onset date had changed over the last 20 years or risk aversion, were associated with increased adaptation. Our framework illustrates the importance of considering the complexity and heterogeneity of individual decision-making when conducting climate impact assessments or when developing policies to enhance the adaptive capacity of local communities to future climate variability and change.

Farm adjustment strategies to water-related challenges in the Murray-Darling Basin,"The paper examines how Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) farmers respond to water-related challenges such as induced by climate change and environmental policy. This is a critical and ongoing aspect of farming operations in Australia's largest watershed. Using the 2013 Regional Wellbeing Survey data, we show that irrigators and dryland farmers adjust their production processes and business models using a wide range of strategies, with irrigators adopting more strategies than dryland farmers and investment-related strategies being the most prevalent form of adjustment. The extent of adjustment depends on farm characteristics: large, intensive-farming units, on-farm income-dependent and annual cropping farmers were more likely to adapt among irrigators. Irrigators also generally place more importance on water-related strategies than output- and input-related strategies. Amongst dryland farmers, hobby farming, non-intensive-farming and perennial cropping units were more likely to adjust than other dryland farms. These empirical findings inform the important debate about developing and targeting adequate policy support for structural adjustment of farming operations in the MDB.",0.9147193207408575,0.18939326348548705,0.08616129470444261,0.4291633485994209,0.021754571313780564,0.025781660874915548,0.1000033427391817
"Adaptation to climate change and the impacts on household food security among rural farmers in uMzinyathi District of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa","It is anticipated that smallholder subsistence farmers will face severe negative impacts from climate change, with household food security being seriously affected. This paper examines the methods of adaptation to climate change used by smallholder farmers and their impacts on household food security. The necessity to adapt to climate change is caused by a combination of sensitivity and exposure and the success in doing so depends on adaptive capacity. Household food security was determined using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). Of the surveyed households, 95 % were aware that climate is changing and expected severe impacts on their crop production systems. Households undertake crop and soil management practices in order to respond to the changing climate. About 83 % of households anticipated that they would alter their livelihoods systems in response to climate change, with 59 % of households indicating that government grants would play an important role in this. Of those assessed, 97 % were severely food insecure and the remaining 3 % were moderately food insecure. Householders were worried about the negative impacts of climate change which included droughts, floods and soil erosion. Householders who were vulnerable to climate change recorded high levels of food insecurity. Decline in prices of farm products, increases in costs of farm inputs and anxiety over occurrence of livestock diseases exacerbated household food insecurity. Information will play a critical role in mitigating the impacts of climate change on household food security but farmers should also be assisted with appropriate input packages, such as seeds and fertilizers that can help them adapt effectively.",0.9741404105843116,0.18573774386004424,0.05092205279499745,0.6668121888698497,0.0206063303837139,0.013046299651578667,0.03987903491126706
A climate for commerce: the political agronomy of conservation agriculture in Zambia,"The promotion of conservation agriculture (CA) for smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa is subject to ongoing scholarly and public debate regarding the evidence-base and the agenda-setting power of involved stakeholders. We undertake a political analysis of CA in Zambia that combines a qualitative case study of a flagship CA initiative with a quantitative analysis of a nationally representative dataset on agricultural practices. This analysis moves from an investigation of the knowledge politics to a study of how the political agendas of the actors involved are shaping agrarian practices. From its initial focus on CA as soil conservation and sustainable agriculture, the framing of the initiative has evolved to accommodate shifting trends in the policy arena. In tandem with the increased focus on climate adaptation, we see an increased emphasis on private sector-led modernisation. The initiative has shifted its target group from the poorest smallholders to prospective commercial farmers, and has forged connections between its farmer-to-farmer extension network and private input suppliers and service providers. The link between CA and input intensification is reflected in national statistics as a significantly higher usage of herbicides, pesticides and mineral fertilizer on fields under CA tillage compared to other fields. We argue that the environmental and participation agendas are used to buttress CA as an environmentally and socially sustainable agricultural development strategy, while the prevailing practice is the result of a common vision for a private sector-led agricultural development shared between the implementing organisation, the donor and international organisations promoting a new green revolution in Africa.",0.7065688855567792,0.29151322369283356,0.153886108854016,0.36054697230700133,0.05552485725545974,0.06631386132932211,0.06155560950066563
Increasing social-ecological resilience within small-scale agriculture in conflict-affected Guatemala,"Climate change scenarios suggest largely detrimental impacts on agricultural production from a deterioration of renewable natural resources. Over the last 15 years, a new field of research has focused on the interactions between climate and conflict risk, particularly as it relates to competition over natural resources and livelihoods. Within this field, there has been less attention to the potential for resource competition to be managed in ways that yield greater cooperation, local adaptation capacity, social-ecological resilience, and conflict mitigation or prevention. The challenge of increasing social-ecological resilience in small-scale agriculture is particularly acute in the socioeconomically and agroecologically marginalized Western Highlands of Guatemala. Not only is climate change a threat to agriculture in this region, but adaptation strategies are challenged by the context of a society torn apart by decades of violent conflict. Indeed, the largely indigenous population in the Western Highlands has suffered widespread discrimination for centuries. The armed conflict has left a legacy of a deeply divided society, with communities often suspicious of outsider interventions and in many cases with neighbors pitted against each other. We use the example of the Buena Milpa agricultural development project to demonstrate how grassroots approaches to collective action, conflict prevention, and social-ecological resilience, linking local stakeholder dynamics to the broader institutional and governance context, can bear fruit amidst postconflict development challenges. Examples of microwatershed management and conservation of local maize varieties illustrate opportunities to foster community-level climate adaptation strategies within small-scale farming systems even in deeply divided societies.",0.5475214641070657,0.33720715120486006,0.1985601886488357,0.4452204830662732,0.07124313813413258,0.04887306590139554,0.10765955509261126
"People's perception of climate change impacts and their adaptation practices in Khotokha valley, Wangdue, Bhutan","Climate change is expected to have serious environmental, economic, and social impacts in mountainous regions worldwide. Rural communities that depend on farming, livestock rearing and natural resources for their livelihoods are likely to be affected by its adverse impacts. This study was carried out to understand one community's perceptions and experiences of climate change and to assess the people's use of forest resources and possible implications for climate change adaptation. The study was conducted through semi-structured questionnaires. The entire population of 67 households was surveyed for the study. The household data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, frequency and inferential statistical tests, namely, parametric t-test and chi-square. The study revealed that a majority of people in the community (79 %) were aware of climate change. Over ninety per cent of the local people depend mainly on cultivation of potato and rearing livestock for their livelihood. The results indicated that climate change and variability have affected the lives of the local people who have developed adaptation strategies in their own way to cope with it. Local people cited impacts including reduced precipitation and an irregular rainfall pattern, which affects potato cultivation and winter fodder production. Production has also been affected by an increased in insect pests. Additionally, new invasive/weed species are reported to be colonizing the pasture land, preventing the regeneration of preferred grass species for grazing. Use of forest products such as fuel wood, flag post, fencing post and litter in particular, have decreased because of available alternatives.

"Opportunities for sustainable intensification of coffee agro-ecosystems along an altitudinal gradient on Mt. Elgon, Uganda","The viability of coffee fanning in East Africa is endangered by multiple factors including climate change, population pressure, low yields, and coffee price volatility. Sustainable intensification (SI) through intercropping and/or agroforestry has been suggested to improve farmers' livelihoods, facilitate adaptation of coffee production to climate change and contribute to biodiversity conservation. In order to understand how sustainable intensification through an ecosystem-based approach might offer opportunities to respond to changes in temperature and rainfall, we analyzed a variety of existing coffee agro-ecosystems that differ in vegetation structure, shade tree diversity, and socio-economic characteristics on Mt. Elgon, Uganda along an altitudinal gradient (1100-2100 m.a.s.l.). We (i) compared the performance of the agro-ecosystems regarding coffee yield and shade tree diversity, and (ii) analyzed determinants of adoption of each system. Three different coffee agro-ecosystems were identified: open canopy coffee system, coffee-banana intercropping, and coffee-tree systems, based on the vegetation structure of 144 coffee plots. The vegetation structure of the analyzed coffee systems varied along the altitudinal gradient. Banana density increased with increasing altitude, while shade tree density and diversity increased with decreasing altitude. Coffee yield also increased with increasing altitude, but this relationship varied with shade level. Coffee yields benefited from shade trees at low altitudes, while no yield differences among systems were observed at mid and high altitudes. Increasing water availability and reliance on on-farm food crops with increasing altitude were identified as the main determinants of the increasing intercropped banana densities. High temperatures and longer dry season in combination with reduced access to forest products at lower altitudes, appeared to be the main driver for increased adoption of coffee-tree systems. Furthermore, socio-economic status of farmers influenced the type of coffee system adopted; poor farmers preferred high intercropping (either with bananas and/or shade trees) to diversify income and reduce risks related to open systems, while wealthier farmers mainly owned open canopy coffee systems. Climate, farm and household size, and access to forests and markets, play a crucial role in determining what constellation of plot-level provisioning ecosystem services benefit farmers' livelihoods on Mt. Elgon. Our findings reveal inherent trade-offs in socio-ecological conditions. Minimizing these is required for achieving the multiple objectives of livelihood improvement, sustainable intensification of coffee production, and biodiversity conservation.",0.9382555630863892,0.16780305326353018,0.10738394932145665,0.5,0.03393148580101892,0.02010362502991106,0.02092763702989077
"Determining factors for the application of climate change adaptation strategies among farmers in Magwe District, dry zone region of Myanmar","Purpose - Climate change negatively affects agricultural crop production in the dry zone region of Myanmar. This paper aims to examine climate change adaptation strategies of farmers in the dry zone region. Farmers' choice for adaptation strategies is influenced by many factors such as the practical availability and by socioeconomic conditions of the farmers. They are moreover influenced by the perception about climate change and by the specific problems prevailing in the farming systems. Design/methodology/approach - This research is carried out in Magwe district in the dry zone region of Myanmar using a random selection of 212 farmers from three Townships (Magwe, Yenanchaung and Chauk). A multinomial logistic regression (MLR) was applied to assess the factors affecting the choice by farmers for adaptation strategies. Findings - The study found that in the past, farmers used to apply locally available indigenous climate change adaptation strategies. However, recently, most farmers seem to have shifted to introduced adaptation strategies. The most popular adaptation strategy is to adjust the planting dates and sowing method (56.1 per cent). Furthermore, farmers identified a number of barriers that limit the adoption of adaptation methods. Risk is found to be an important driver of crop diversification. Finally, the MLR model showed that information from radio, access to seeds and extension services affect the choice of adaptation strategies. Originality/value - The study shows that adoption of locally available indigenous climate change adaptation methods is gradually decreasing, and there is a shift to introduced adaptation strategies. The study can assist public and private organizations to obtain insight in the determinants of climate change adaptation in the dry zone region of Myanmar.",0.9855409298558262,0.160086900569443,0.07191370760928954,0.5969979318617151,0.022351448603643985,0.01835467179528604,0.012210638114679422
Mountain Farming Systems' Exposure and Sensitivity to Climate Change and Variability: Agroforestry and Conventional Agriculture Systems Compared in Ecuador's Indigenous Territory of Kayambi People,"Smallholder farming is considered one of the most vulnerable sectors to the impacts of climate change, variability, and extremes, especially in the developing world. This high vulnerability is due to the socioeconomic limitations and high environmental sensitivity which affect the biophysical and socioeconomic components of their farming systems. Therefore, systems' functionality and farmers' livelihoods will also be affected, with significant implications for global food security, land-use/land-cover change processes and agrobiodiversity conservation. Thus, less vulnerable and more resilient smallholder farming systems constitute an important requisite for sustainable land management and to safeguard the livelihoods of millions of rural and urban households. This study compares a comprehensive socioeconomic and environmental dataset collected in 2015-2016 based on household interviews of 30 farmers of highland agroforestry systems and 30 farmers of conventional agriculture systems, to determine which system provides better opportunities to reduce exposure and sensitivity. A modified Climate Change Questionnaire Version 2 of the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) was applied to collect the data. The interview data are based on the perceptions of Kayambi indigenous farmers about the levels of exposure and sensitivity of their farming systems during the last decade. Descriptive statistics were applied to analyze the data from the 60 farms. Results indicate that both agroforesters and conventional farmers clearly perceived increases in temperature and reductions in precipitation for the last decade, and expected this trend to continue in the next decade. Furthermore, conventional farmers perceived greater exposure to droughts (20%), solar radiation (43%), and pests, weeds and disease outbreaks (40%) than agroforesters. Additionally, results emphasize the better ability of agroforestry systems to reduce exposure and sensitivity to climate change and variability. These findings support the well-known assumptions about the key role played by agroforestry systems for climate change adaptation and mitigation, especially in developing countries.",0.9528586551035937,0.24180687148124305,0.10011320544398063,0.5410605198433068,0.03132296662745106,0.015088089510448202,0.021760818321916342
"Smallholders' Tree Planting Activity in the Ziro Province, Southern Burkina Faso: Impacts on Livelihood and Policy Implications","Climate variability and change significantly affect smallholder farmers' food security and livelihoods in sub-Saharan Africa. Tree planting is one of the measures promoted by development programs to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Tree planting is also believed to positively contribute to livelihoods. This paper examines factors influencing smallholders' tree planting activities in four villages in the Ziro province, Southern Burkina Faso. Furthermore, it analyses the challenges encountered and willingness to continue tree planting under current tenure arrangements. The data was obtained through key informants, household interviews, focus group discussions, and field observations. Results indicate that the majority of farmers interviewed planted Mangifera indica (50%), Anacardium occidentale (32%) and Moringa oleifera (30%). In a number of trees planted, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Mangifera indica and Anacardium occidentale dominated. Tree planters were mainly farmers who held large and old farm areas, were literate and relatively wealthy, had favorable attitudes toward tree planting, and with considerable years of participation in a farmers' group. The main reasons for planting trees included income generation from the sale of tree products, access to markets and local support for tree planting. Preference for agriculture, tenure insecurity and lack of sufficient land were the main reasons cited for not planting trees. Farm households that were relatively poor, had smaller workforces and smaller farm sizes were not willing to continue tree planting. To effectively engage farmers in tree planting and to make it more attractive, policies are needed that address tenure insecurity for migrants, enable better access to markets, and support fair pricing structures for wood and other tree resources.",0.9252403013898973,0.20494874280664366,0.08716560095243306,0.5955182532077011,0.0409698665100402,0.019138881634763363,0.02835706873054805
Adaptive institutional design in agri-environmental programs,"Purpose - This paper aims to explore how and in what context adaptive governance might work in practice in relation to climate variability through the study of two successful agri-environmental programs. Design/methodology/approach - Data were obtained through semi-structured qualitative interviews with key policy informants as well as rural agricultural producers. The adaptive attributes of two successful agri-environmental programs with a proven track record in reducing vulnerability and increasing adaptive capacity of rural producers were studied, including program responsiveness, program framing, stakeholder engagement mechanisms, and the respective roles of key actors. Findings - The adaptive governance practices of program delivery through localized government personnel and organizations increased perceived responsiveness. Mechanisms of program delivery and stakeholder participation and review changed over time as well as the framing of programs. Producers and key policy informants agreed that producers responded to concretely framed issues. A possible disconnect was discovered in the anticipated role of government in relation to meeting and responding to the climate change challenge. Practical implications - This research shows a need to study changes in programs over time in relation to the attributes of adaptive management. Differing climatic events, geographies, and government and stakeholder priorities all contribute to changes in the institutional design of programs and policies. Originality/value - This paper documents adaptive governance practices in relation to two agri-environmental programs that have successfully facilitated producer adaptation to climate variability in the past, as well as the perceptions of agricultural producers of the future role of government in relation to responding to climate change.",0.648496145419839,0.26834333941360866,0.2471622529335945,0.3946345708721573,0.08770022877505383,0.048260287375542756,0.09320239718928558
Climate change and farming systems in the region of Setif (Algeria),"In Setif region (Algeria), the constraints of the semi-arid climate already limit farm profitability. Throughout the years, local farmers have modified their farming systems to mitigate the negative effects of climate. This paper aimed to describe the trend of climate change and at what extent it could affect the farming systems. The climate evolution was analyzed through the annual rainfall time series (1970- 2011) of 50 observation stations spread over the study area. A study of modifications in farming activities engendered by climate change, such as a shifting to new farming systems, was carried out on a sample of 537 farms spread over in three agro-ecological regions: the northern, central and southern zones. The annual rainfall of the period 1970-2011 over the study area was 457mm, However the annual rainfall maps for the periods 1970-1990 and 1991-2011 showed a high spatiotemporal variability, where some areas tended to become more wet, in contrast others areas were affected by drought severity . The main changes in agricultural activities for adapting to climate constraint were a reduction of areas devoted to rainfed crops (cereals) and the adoption of an intensive farming system based on poultry, cattle breeding and intensive crops, especially in the central and the southern zones. Challenges of agricultural development programs in the context of future climate change will be to manage the conversion of the ancestral farming systems to sustainable systems, preserve the social value of agriculture and boost the economic profitability of farms without affecting natural resources.",0.9490391302614974,0.17724353108468605,0.09401108252086762,0.48415843122894364,0.03112092486734416,0.011050131218558754,0.031972880345998135
Pastoralists' perception of and adaptation strategies for climate change: associations with observed climate variability,"Although climate change is a universal phenomenon, its indicators and manifestations are entirely local, as are adaptation choices, strategies, and practices. Based on face-to-face interview data from 427 randomly selected pastoral households of the Hulun Buir grassland in northern China, this study investigated perceptions and impacts of historical climate change and the associations of these perceptions with observed climate change. Meanwhile, we identified pastoralists' responses to climate change, as well as barriers to the adaptation process. We used binary logistic regression models to determine the factors that influence climate change adaptation strategies. The results show that pastoralists' perception of the inter-annual variability in climate variables is relatively consistent with the observed meteorological data. Pastoralists' adaptive strategies for climate variability comprise primarily livestock and pasture management interventions, such as purchasing fodder, reducing livestock, part-time grazing, and renting pasture. In addition, pastoralists identified several barriers that are allied with adaptation practices, such as limited grassland tenure, an absence of credit, and limited access to agricultural markets. Furthermore, the sex, age, and education level of the head of household and the household livelihood capital and location were found to be the key factors determining the choice of adaptation strategies. This knowledge helps to assess the needs for action and information and to improve the credibility of policies that shape collective actions based on a unified plan or goal. Combined, these efforts aid in adaptation to reduce the vulnerability of the livestock sector, especially the livelihood security of smallholder pastoralists in grassland ecosystems.",0.8978879709147312,0.2408141220192246,0.11889900809234374,0.5774376964016501,0.0474749372530045,0.029631000793547337,0.05545746980340266
Smallholder farmers' perceptions and adaptive response to climate variability and climate change in southern rural Ghana,"This paper assesses the perception and adaptation strategies employed by smallholder farmers to abate the effect of climate variability. Using a mixed method cross-sectional research approach on smallholder farmers in the Bosomtwe district, 152 farmer respondents were sampled from 12 communities by a simple random sampling technique. The quantitative data gathered were subjected to the tools of binary logistic regression analysis, multiple regression analysis, contingency tables and frequencies, embedded in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v. 17. Farmers' observations were consistent with meteorological data which revealed that temperature has been increasing since 1981 and rainfall pattern has been erratic. Perception of deforestation (p < 0.05) was a significant and positive predictor of climate change. A binary logistic regression analysis performed on disposition of farmers persistently practicing a particular adaptation strategy indicated that irrigation, mulch, use of agrochemicals and changing the type of crop cultivated were positive and significant at p = .027, p = .000, p = .020 and p = .035, respectively. Policy on adaptation must make room for and capitalize on local knowledge for sustainable climate action. Agroforestry should be introduced to farmers to curb such maladaptive practices of clearing of forests and help sustain forest and agriculture.",0.9621678538845009,0.19682113305474555,0.0875364623030015,0.5362833169075509,0.028166960927930397,0.021044468840479856,0.03394869161750489
"CLIMATE CHANGE PERCEPTIONS AND ADAPTIVE ACTIONS BY PASTORAL COMMUNITY ON THE TIBETAN PLATEAU, CHINA","Tibetan plateau is an area of global ecological and cultural significance often called the third pole of the earth, world water towers and roof of the world. The plateau provides forage to 95% of world's total yak population and supports the largest pastoral population (9.8 million) of the globe. The plateau is vulnerable to climate change which threatens grassland resources, watersheds, livestock and pastoral population. As the pastoralists are the key custodians of the plateau, this study examined their climate change perceptions and analyzed their adaptation strategies in Tibetan Plateau, China. The results showed that majority of the pastoralists were aware of the climate change issues in the plateau. It was found that pastoralists have noticed changes in climate variability leading to grassland degradation and poor animal health and productivity. TV Programs about climate change and weather forecast programs were among the key tools for developing pastoral perception about climate change. The demographic characteristic of the pastorals like education, age and household size proved to contribute in the development of climate change perceptions among pastorals (P <= 0.05). The study found that livelihood diversification, having mixed livestock breeds, cultivation of high yielding and drought tolerant forage varieties, grassland fencing and controlled grazing were among the most practiced adaptation strategies in the Plateau. Pastoralists are the key stakeholders of the Plateau. Therefore, their capacity needs improvement to adapt climate effects and work with the government institutions for the betterment of the plateau and their improved livelihood so that it can create win-win situation for pastoralists and government managers as well.",0.7862209469294283,0.3140471937333929,0.13447188703059354,0.47733688246635,0.03912004853821222,0.02812980998355384,0.06091340976090706
Smallholder farmers' attitudes and determinants of adaptation to climate risks in East Africa,"Adapting to climate risks is central to the goal of increasing food security and enhancing resilience of farming systems in East Africa. We examined farmers' attitudes and assessed determinants of adaptation using data from a random sample of 500 households in Borana, Ethiopia; Nyando, Kenya; Hoima, Uganda; and Lushoto, Tanzania. Adaptation was measured using a livelihood-based index that assigned weights to different individual strategies based on their marginal contributions to a household's livelihood. Results showed that farmers' attitudes across the four sites strongly favored introduction of new crops, changes in crop varieties, and changes in planting times. Farmers disfavored soil, land, and water management practices. At lower levels of adaptation (25% quantile), adaptation index correlated positively with membership to farmers' groups, household size, sex of the household head, and number of months of food shortage. Farmer group membership enhanced adaptation at intermediate (50% quantile) level whereas access to credit increased adaptation at high (75% quantile) level. Food insecurity, however, correlated negatively with the likelihood to choose individual adaptation strategies suggesting that although households adapted to improve food security status of their households, hunger was a barrier to adaptation. Our findings suggest that providing climate information to inform timely planting, promoting crop diversification, and encouraging adoption of adapted varieties of crops might be successful to enhancing resilience of farming systems in the short-term. In the long-term, increased investment in reducing hunger, encouraging groups formation, and easing liquidity constraints will be required to promote adaptation through implementation of soil, water, and land management strategies.

"Climate change and agriculture: An overview of farmers perception and adaptations in Balambat Tehsil, District Dir Lower, Pakistan","The present research was aimed to determine the ability of farmers to detect climate change and how they have adapted to whatever climate change they believe has occurred. Farmers have indigenous knowledge of the climate of the area to predict and forecast the changing weather and climate. Knowing such traditional knowledge provides an opportunity to understand how the farmers are adapting to new type of weather. The study was carried out in Balambat Tehsil District Dir Lower. They study is primarily based on questionnaire survey and focus group discussion. A total of fifteen villages out of total 173 were selected for study, 75 farmers were interviewed, 05 from each of the 15 selected villages. A total of 15 focus group discussions were organised, one is each selected village. The key parameters addressed during survey were cropping pattern, sowing, harvesting date and yield per acre of different crops, pests and crops diseases, flowering time of fruits trees, biodiversity and livestock's. Respondents were selected randomly but priority was given to elders and those possess land and practice agriculture. The study reveals that majority of the respondents are well aware of climate change and its effects on cropping calendar, crop variety, crop yield, crop diseases as well as an earlier blossoming of fruit trees. The respondents in all the fifteen villages unanimously agreed that sowing and harvesting dates of crops are 10-20 days earlier than it used to be 20 year ago (1992-2012). Similar change was reported in the time of fruit tree blossoming because of the onset of early summer and shortening of winter season. Majority of farmers believe that warmer climate caused a variety of new crop diseases. Survey reveals that there is not only decrease in the amount of rainfall but the timing of rainfall is also changed. The study demonstrated mixed type of results about the awareness level of the respondents in relation to climate change. The only adaptation strategy opted by farmers in the study area is change in crop calendar. © 2018, Sarhad Journal of Agriculture.",0.9711206367291806,0.20177081254887172,0.08275092852382866,0.4617542512170019,0.02933965623352376,0.012684825591590853,0.012052686449084393

The Impact of Climate Shocks on Seed Purchase Decisions in Malawi: Implications for Climate Change Adaptation,"This paper addresses the relevance of agricultural seed systems in terms of the production and dissemination of seed in the context of adaptation to climate change. Using nationwide household level data from Malawi, we examine the hypothesis that climatic shocks increase small-scale farmers' reliance on purchased seeds, in particular from local seed markets, an element of the informal seed sector. The results are used to discuss the role of seed systems for potentially supporting small-scale farmers' adaptation mechanisms in the face of climate change in Malawi. This study has implications for other similar sub-Saharan African contexts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Integration of ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change policies in Viet Nam,"There is growing recognition of the importance of ecosystem-based approaches for adaptation to climate change-it is a cost-effective measure that has multiple benefits and can overcome many of the drawbacks of more common engineering adaptation options. Viet Nam has a rich biodiversity and is also one of the most vulnerable countries impacted by climate change. Climate change policies have been adopted at national and local levels as well as by sector, making Viet Nam one of the nations to most systematically fulfill their obligation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Consequently, we have used Viet Nam as a case study, to assess the integration of ecosystem-based approach to adaptation to climate change. We found that ecosystem-based adaptation is being implemented in some projects but, overall, is inadequately considered by Viet Nam's climate change policies. Instead, policies predominantly rename infrastructure projects as climate change adaptation and focus on hard solutions for disaster reduction, rather than responding to long-term climate change through ecosystem-based adaptation. Moreover, ecosystem-based adaptation projects have focused on only a few relevant types of ecosystems. Viet Nam should revise its existing climate change policies and sectoral strategies to integrate ecosystem-based adaptation across different scales of governance. As other nations develop adaptation policies at different scales, the lesson from Viet Nam is that engineering measures need to be balanced with ecosystem-based adaptation for more affordable and effective responses to climate change.",0.3028813258236265,0.321605727745484,0.2855606144968325,0.31270238855782084,0.17980378382508927,0.10922361970679481,0.14035887635157668
Linking livelihood assets of smallholder households to risk management strategies: an empirical study in China,"Multiple types of global change processes increasingly impact rural development programs; the interplay between these processes can impact rural livelihoods in unforeseen and surprising ways. To date, most of the studies examining farmers' risk perceptions and risk management strategies have been agriculture-focused with little attention to their livelihood system. This study introduces the framework of the sustainable livelihood approach (SLA) to examine farmers' risk perceptions and the risk management strategies of smallholder households in rural China. Based on data collected from a sample of 540 smallholder households, we used descriptive statistics for analyzing and classifying risk sources and risk management strategies. A multinomial logistic regression model is employed to explore the role of livelihood assets in farmers' preferred risk management strategies. The results find that farmers express higher levels of concern about educational risk, health risk and employment risk. They put more faith in internal coping strategies (e.g. 'resort to acquaintances' and 'sell livestock') rather than reduction or mitigation strategies (e.g. 'buy insurance', 'employ new techniques' and 'diversify income sources') to manage those risks. Further, these results differ according to the geographical and farmer characteristics. Livelihood assets are likely to affect the choice of the farmers' preferred risk management strategies.",0.9084218730861335,0.23407790347620033,0.0755283928502727,0.5258154899024016,0.015073336460007532,0.03088503534199128,0.04406469345060124
Farmers' Adaptation to Extreme Weather Events through Farm Management and Its Impacts on the Mean and Risk of Rice Yield in China,"We explore how rice farmers adjust their farm management practices in response to extreme weather events and determine whether their adjustments affect the mean, risk, and downside risk of rice yield. Based on a survey of 1,653 rice farmers in China, our econometric analyses show that the severity of drought and flood in the study areas significantly increases the risk and downside risk of rice yield. The applied farm management measures respond to severe drought and flood and can be considered as adaptation to climate change, an issue often ignored in previous studies. We model adaptation and its impact on rice yield for adapters and non-adapters. Utilizing a moment-based approach, we show that adaptation through farm management measures significantly increases rice yield and reduces the risk and downside risk of rice yield. Several policies, including scaling up the cost-effective farm management adaptation and providing public services related to natural disasters, are recommended to improve adaptive capacity of farmers, particular the poor, in response to extreme events.",0.8857655748429434,0.204379151701011,0.09045502449547509,0.23264499702701458,0.0568691748772184,0.05402738504379333,0.1247582609063103
"Adoption and Dissemination Pathways for Climate-Smart Agriculture Technologies and Practices for Climate-Resilient Livelihoods in Lushoto, Northeast Tanzania","Smallholder farmers in East Africa need information and knowledge on appropriate climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, technologies, and institutional innovations in order to effectively adapt to changing climatic conditions and cope with climate variability. This paper assesses farmer adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices and innovation after being exposed to Farms of the Future Approach (FotF). First; we explore and assess the various CSA technologies and practices; including institutional innovations farmers are adopting. Second; we identify and document farmer learning and dissemination pathways that can enhance adoption of CSA technologies and practices. Third; we identify existing institutions that enhance adoption of CSA practices. We use household survey data, complemented by qualitative information from focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The results show farmers are adopting a variety of CSA technologies, practices, and institutional innovations to after participating in the FotF approach with use of improved crop varieties, agroforestry, and scientific weather forecast information cited as the main practices. To minimize their risks and reduce vulnerabilities, farmers are diversifying and integrating five to 10 CSA practices in one season. Matengo pits, SACCOs, and efficient energy stoves were adopted by very few farmers due to their high initial investment costs and unsuitability to the area. Ninety-eight percent of farmers reported that they receive agricultural information orally from a variety of sources including government extension workers, seed companies, researchers, traditional experts, neighbors, radio agricultural shows, religious groups, farmer groups, and family members. Lastly, farmers reported that the FotF approach is a useful tool that enabled them to interact with other farmers and learn new CSA practices and innovations. Suggested improvements to make on the FotF included include longer trip duration, increased number of farmer participants, and gender balance and age considerations to include youth.",0.9870989257751781,0.16418476965027184,0.06904075244906968,0.615805686670071,0.007378175713909424,0.007586322997037497,0.011876988448106314
Impact of climate-change risk-coping strategies on livestock productivity and household welfare: empirical evidence from Pakistan,"Using the primary datasets collected from 700 livestock farmers from all four major provinces of Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit Baltistan, this paper analyzes the impact of climate-change risk coping strategies on household welfare. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the determinants of the livestock ownership and multivariate probit model to assess the determinants of the measures taken to manage the climatic-risk challenge for livestock. A propensity score matching approach (PSM) was used to assess the impact of the adopted climate-risk management strategies on livestock farmers. Findings indicated that in Pakistan livestock farmers generally adopt four main types of strategies to cope with climate risk: livestock insurance, selling of livestock, allocation of more land area for fodder and migration. The results show that age, education, wealth, access to extension services, and membership in NGOs, influence the livestock farmers' choice of climate-risk-coping mechanisms. The livestock farmers who adopted risk-coping mechanisms generally fared better. Increasing the land area allocated to fodder seems to increase production of milk and butter, resulting in higher income and lower poverty levels. Those who bought insurance had more milk production and a lower poverty level, while those who sold livestock to cope with climate risk decreased production but increased household income and lowered poverty levels. Migration seems to have a negative impact on production and income. Impact assessments confirm that purchasing livestock insurance and increasing fodder areas are more effective compared to the selling of livestock and migration. Agricultural climate policy should focus on creating awareness as well as increasing access to extension services among livestock farmers on climate risk and risk-coping strategies to mitigate the impact on rural livelihoods.",0.9593600511961085,0.20886476714076335,0.06025815351042688,0.617607451211797,0.01963104103916024,0.016696227153898003,0.01605195292955142
"Smallholder farmers' perceptions on climate change and the use of sustainable agricultural practices in the chinyanja triangle, Southern Africa","In developing regions with high levels of poverty and a dependence on climate sensitive agriculture, studies focusing on climate change adaptation, planning, and policy processes, have gained relative importance over the years. This study assesses the impact of farmer perceptions regarding climate change on the use of sustainable agricultural practices as an adaptation strategy in the Chinyanja Triangle, Southern Africa. In this empirical approach, we adopt methods that account for the plausibility that unmeasured characteristics exist, which are correlated with perceptions and the adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices. We use a unique and representative dataset collected in December 2012 and June 2013, from smallholder farmers in the Chinyanja Triangle. The results indicate that farmer's perceptions significantly influence the use of sustainable agricultural practices. Specifically, we established that farmer perceptions considerably impact the use of grain legume rotations, inorganic fertilizers, compost, and farmyard manure. Our results highlight the need for a serious and perhaps equal consideration of farmer perceptions regarding climate change, as important inputs to climate change adaptation policies targeted at enhancing climatic resilience in smallholder farming communities. This is plausible as the adaptation and pliability of farmers to the effects of climate change should be a social process involving the collective efforts from various stakeholders. © 2016 by the author.",0.9031450164389144,0.22622127325539473,0.09714881661745425,0.4894899640110454,0.033976548876770346,0.03137417730408701,0.04452243932366462
Promoting production and marketing of root crops in Southern Africa in a changing climate using integrated agricultural research for development (IAR4D) pathway,"Climate change is expected to have adverse impacts on smallholder farmers whose livelihoods depend on rain-fed agriculture. In fact, climate change is expected to continue to pose a serious threat to agriculture in southern Africa as annual rainfall amounts are expected to decline and temperatures are expected to increase. Studies show that the impacts will depend on the extent of smallholder farmers' adaptation in response to climate change and variability. However, despite numerous extension efforts and repeated past maize crop failures, smallholder farmers in southern Africa continue to show preference to maize over other drought resistant crops. The low rate of adoption of drought resistant crops in response to the changing climate has been blamed on the linear non-participatory manner in which agricultural research and development efforts are organised. The present study seeks to establish whether reorganising research and development in an integrated manner known as Integrated Agricultural Research for Development - (IAR4D) would contribute towards the adoption of drought resistant crops and also improve household incomes. The study used cross-sectional household survey data collected from Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi to determine the local average treatment effect of adopting drought resistant crops (in this case root and tuber crops) on household income. A multistage sampling technique was used to sample 600 households from the three countries. The data was collected as part of an end-line survey in the proof of IAR4D concept from conventional, treatment and control sites in each of the three countries. Results from the analysis show that smallholders in IAR4D villages which produced and sold root and tuber crops had higher household incomes than farmers who did not produce and sell these crops. The results also show that smallholder farmers who participated in IAR4D activities adopted roots and tuber crops to militate against the effects of climate change and variability. The study concluded that IAR4D could effectively deal with institutional and technical issues that constrain smallholders from adapting to climate change and variability. Furthermore, climate change adaptation strategies could be easily promoted using an integrated agricultural research for development approach.",0.9752851474933796,0.14991942384602674,0.051474481541303824,0.5939135697057925,0.016735840397598515,0.013361966947929403,0.02313116811729786
Perception of climate change and adaptation strategies in Vietnam Are there intra-household gender differences?,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to first examine the factors affecting the intra-household perception of climate change. Second, the study investigates the impact of the perception of climatic stress on the operators' and spouses' intra-household adaptation strategies (farm and household financial strategies). Design/methodology/approach - The study uses household survey data from Vietnam's Mekong Delta. The study uses probit and negative binomial count data approaches to evaluate the empirical model. Findings - Results confirm the existence of intra-household gender differences in the adaptation strategies. The authors found that although spouses perceive climatic stress, they are less likely to adapt to such stresses when it comes farming enterprise, but more likely to adapt to household financial strategies. In contrast, farm operators, in the presence of climatic stresses, undertake both farm and household finance adaptation strategies. Practical implications - Investment in climate smart agriculture can help households in managing climatic stresses. Originality/value - A farmer in Asia, and Vietnam in particular, faces significant risks from climatic changes. In Vietnam, agriculture is easily affected by natural disasters and climatic changes. This study provides insights into the perception of climatic changes by operators and spouses in Vietnam's Mekong Delta. Perceived changes in the climate have a greater impact on women because they typically lack the necessary tools to adapt to climate change. The current findings could be useful in managing climatic risk in Vietnam's Mekong Delta and be helpful to policymakers in designing risk management strategies in response to climatic changes.",0.8606836300953167,0.25691765591960675,0.08396349384326485,0.5657105287110337,0.061254060222657274,0.026672384855802415,0.02916534949815314
Adaptation of farming community to climatic risk: does adaptation cost for sustaining agricultural profitability?,"Adaptation strategies that can minimize the negative effects of climatic risk were implemented in over 2000 farms in 12 villages of Mewat district in Haryana, India. Detailed household (HH) level data from 120 farm families for two periods (prior to intervention and end of project period) indicated: (i) agricultural profit of adapted farmers was more than that of non-adapted farmers in all strata according to the difference in difference model; (ii) non-adapted farmers in <4 acre groups have to either alter the existing agricultural practices to reduce management cost and increase profit or incur additional cost for adaptation; (iii) large farmers may have to rationalize their management investments for gaining more profits; (iv) the profit is not directly proportional to the cost of adaptation, if any, among different strata of farmers; (v) agricultural income alone cannot sustain small and marginal farm (<4 acre) families, however with adaptation a self-sustaining agriculture could be achieved; (vi) suitable adaptation can reduce the cost of farm operations, and increase agricultural profits as well as adaptive capacity to climatic risks; (vii) additional cost is not always required for adaptation, and rationalizing agricultural expenditure is essential to adapt to climatic risks. At community level differential costs of adaptation and profits are likely. Policies for incentivizing these 'responsive adaptation' costs for small and marginal farmers would be required. However, investments may be required for establishing permanent agricultural-infrastructure for managing water and agricultural produce in order to sustain agricultural profitability.",0.9433300045041823,0.2166265391833685,0.07411196147160172,0.4191662836920908,0.037509671046647305,0.027680137410249,0.05620952788725067
Adaptation to climate change in Afghanistan: Evidence on the impact of external interventions,"Climate change is a significant obstacle for farmers in the least developed countries like Afghanistan and adaptation support is exceptionally scarce. This paper provides evidence on the impact of the agriculture-related external support on farmers’ adaptation to climate change in the Central Highlands of Afghanistan. To this end, we collected primary data from 1434 farmers whom we interviewed across 14 districts in Bamiyan, Ghazni, and Diakundi provinces. We employ quasi-experimental econometric methods, including an endogenous switching regression analysis, to estimate the treatment effects on various adaptation-related outcomes. We find significant impacts of support interventions on the use of improved types of seeds and farmers’ access to irrigation water. Further impacts on the risk of flood, economic and financial as well as government and institutional adaptation constraints appear to be significant, but sensitive to the existence of unobserved factors. We conclude that farmers perceived changes in the climate, and most of them tried to adapt by employing measures available to them. The impact of external support has been partially effective in addressing immediate and short-term farming challenges related to climate change and extreme weather events. They, however, have not been effective in treating long-term fundamental climate change-related risks. Based on our analysis of the past treatments and farmers’ self-reported priorities, we provide a list of policy recommendations for adaptation to climate change in farming communities in Afghanistan. © 2019 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland",0.8486007393199899,0.23441427386679786,0.07467656824406098,0.3572209465317604,0.03443125835364099,0.03564110634039636,0.08626227107942874

Silvopastoral system based on Ficus thonningii: an adaptation to climate change in northern Ethiopia,"This study in northern Ethiopia investigated local people's perception of climate change and the role of indigenous silvopastoralism in adaptation to that change. Two hundred and forty respondents participated in a questionnaire survey and group discussions. Local communities perceive climate change in terms of biophysical and socioeconomic indicators. In selecting, evaluating and comparing fodder trees for a climate-resilient silvopastoral system, local farmers used 20 criteria of varying importance and belonging to three categories: animal-based, plant-based and multipurpose. In terms of suitability for climate-resilient silvopastoral system, Ficus thonningii was ranked first among the top 10 species of trees with a composite score of 8.7 out of 10, followed by Cordia africana, Eucalyptus cameldulensis and Rhus natalensis. Locally developed protocols for propagation and use of F. thonningii have enabled establishment of a climate-resilient, sustainable silvopastoral system.

Farmer-level adaptation to climate change and agricultural drought: empirical evidences from the Barind region of Bangladesh,"The north-western part of Bangladesh especially the Barind region is considered as a drought-prone area. The objective of this paper is to find out the adaptation measures practised by farmers to cope with climate change and agricultural drought in two drought-prone villages of the north-western Bangladesh. The primary data for this study were collected from a structured questionnaire survey conducted on 130 households selected from 192 through simple random sampling. The present study finds that agriculture of this area is recurrently disrupted by frequent drought events. Moreover, the climate change will increase both frequency and magnitude of extreme drought events in this region. This paper identifies that the impacts of drought on agriculture are difficulties in irrigation, disruption in cropping pattern, depletion of ground water table, problem in fish cultivation and so on. On the other hand, analyses unveil that respondents practised a range of adjustment strategies to combat adverse impacts of drought such as adoptions of drought-tolerant crop varieties, rainwater harvesting, mango and jujube intercropping with rice, kitchen gardening, weed control and reducing water loss, constructing water control structures, irrigation and cultivation of fast-growing fish species. Therefore, the present study recommends proper drought early warning system, reserving surface water, managing supplemental irrigation, tree plantation, re-excavation of canals and traditional ponds, credit support to the farmers, preparedness and awareness rising to ensure the future sustainable agricultural development in the study areas.",0.9536030950024913,0.22837366525499825,0.08660817489118686,0.36301947435575277,0.03403935758801875,0.027626481021791587,0.2198520016548682
Farmers' adaptive practices for drought risk reduction in the northwest region of Bangladesh,"Being an agrarian region, the northwest part of Bangladesh frequently experiences recurrent droughts over the last decade. To cope with this insidious disaster, the farmers in this region practice various adaptation measures through their own efforts with institutional support. But these efforts and support are not sufficient for farmers to survive droughts. In this light, this study assesses the adaptive capacity of farmers along with institutions to develop suitable drought adaptation policy in the context of this region. The drought adaptive practices developed in this study are mainly adopted from the unique approach called socioeconomic, institutional and physical. Results reveal that establishment of mango orchard, vegetable gardening and community health care service would be helpful in enhancing drought resilience at community level. Moreover, an important policy message from this study suggests that validation of these practices through government offices, research institutes and other relevant organizations can help to develop an appropriate drought adaptation policy for this region. Similarly, by performing these practices from national to local level, farmers as well as communities in this region will be able to effectively sustain their livelihoods against droughts.",0.8509909671265118,0.31230292896974404,0.1230592472421359,0.46224800765483537,0.05663222627566741,0.036072633176106685,0.2513699545960902
Extension services and behavioral strategies of farmers to deal with risk,"Agriculture is considered a critical sector in the world economy while the nature of the agricultural activities is mainly based on the risk, implying the need for more attention to risk management. In this regard, it is important to consider the role of educational programs and how farmers react to risk. The purpose of this survey research was to explore the role of extension services on strategies for coping with wheat production risks among farmers in Kermanshah province, Iran. The target research population consisted of all wheat producers in Kermanshah province who cultivated wheat in 2016-2017 (N=102000). A stratified random sampling method was used to select and interview 383 farmers in six districts of Kermanshah (n= 383). The reliability of different parts was estimated in a pilot study to be in the range of 0.73-0.94. The results highlighted 35 strategies that significantly influenced risk. Out of 35 adaptation strategies, the use of disinfected seeds was ranked the first among farm adaptive measures, while cooperative cultivation was ranked as the least frequently utilized. Despite the rather low use of the extension services by farmers, there was a positive significant relationship between the coping strategies and extension services. The results provide useful insights for researchers, extension agents, and farmers. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

Government intervention and farmers' adaptation to Saline intrusion: A case study in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta,"The Vietnamese Mekong Delta is located in the southern part of the country where the Mekong River runs through before it empties into the East Sea. Saline intrusion is a recurrent problem causing serious risks for agriculture and coastal livelihoods of the majority of people in the Delta. Collective adaptation plays an important role in improving the capacity of rural community to deal with environmental complexities. This research aims to examine how the collective adaptation supports the farmer and institutional adaptation to the conditions of saltwater intrusion in Tra Vinh and Kien Giang provinces. Statistical analysis was used to examine the trend of saltwater intrusion and the change in livelihoods of farmers in the Delta. The result shows the remarkable increase in salinity over the past twenty years. Various forms of adaptation were demonstrated by farmers' and governments' efforts in implementing adaptation practices to address salinity. Farmers have changed from rice to shrimp culture either through an intensive or extensive system where it is favorable to local environmental conditions. Meanwhile, local governments have attempted to establish various mechanisms to support collective actions (e.g., cooperative policies). The study highlights the critical role of formal and informal institutions that assist local adaptation processes. Adaptation practices were most pronounced in areas profoundly exposed to salinity impacts. The study suggests that further attention should be given to the establishment of institutional structures and rural social networks and how they are instrumental to collective adaptation. © International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology.",0.8032801661748873,0.27347299116483065,0.1441063263836964,0.4427149560984933,0.14209284205199035,0.05003793141124693,0.11681498161945011
Empirically based analysis of households coping with unexpected shocks in the central Himalayas,"Climate change may significantly impact the large number of households in developing countries depending on agricultural production, not least through changes in the frequency and/or magnitude of climatic hazards resulting in household income shocks. This paper analyses rural households' responses to past experiences of and future expectations to substantial and unexpected negative and positive agricultural income shocks. Empirical data is derived from an environmentally-augmented structured household (n = 112) survey in the high mountains of central Nepal. Multinomial logit regression, using data on rural household demographics, assets (agricultural land, livestock), value of other assets such as furniture, bicycles, and agricultural implements, and income sources showed that household coping choices are determined by opportunities to generate cash.

The alternative livelihood development strategy in order to improve local fishermen revenue in the Border region of Indonesia and timor leste,"The impact of climate change is causing obstacles for fishermen because of the increasing risk of fishing, changing seasons and fishing locations, uncertainty of the wind season, thus affecting the number of catches. Climate change conditions that disrupt marine ecosystems certainly can worsen the economic life of fishermen households. The decrease in fish catch will have implications on household income. Fishermen in Belu have dependence on fishery sector especially capture fishery. Local fishermen need a strategy to increase revenue through alternative livelihoods to adapt to erratic fishing season. One of the economic adaptation strategies that fishermen can do is adaptation of human resources in fishery households through economic activities outside the fishery. This research aims to determine the income of fishermen households, analyzed the contribution of alternative efforts to total household income and analyze the involvement of family members of fishermen and the time spent to perform alternative livelihoods in the border areas of Indonesia and Timor Leste. The research was conducted using survey method through interview and observation technique. The results suggest that alternative livelihoods should be developed as a form of adaptation fishing households in retained revenue caused by decreased income from the main livelihoods as fishermen due to climate change. © 2019, BIOFLUX SRL.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS EFFECT ON LAND USE CHANGE IN THE CENTRAL RIFT VALLEY OF ETHIOPIA,"Climate change and variability have been one of the challenges to socioeconomic and environmental sustainability in the twenty-first century. Meteorological analyses of historical drought occurrences are common in East Africa, but studies devoted to its effect on land use change are yet limited. This paper aimed to assess the long-term rainfall and temperature variability and its effects on farmers' land use change in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia over the past 30-36 years using a combination of meteorological and socioeconomic data. Results show that the overall coefficient of variation for rainfall was more than 35% for rainy seasons. Out of the 36 years, total rainfall of the rainy season showed negative anomalies for about half of these years. Summer season rainfall started after the average time of onset for about 42% of the database years, and it ceased ahead of the average time of the stop for about 56% of these years. As a result of such rainfall shortage and variability, about 82% of the drought-vulnerable farmers had already changed their land use from pastoralist/agropastoralist to mixed farming while 10% have a wish to shift to other land use options in the future. Hence, future policies need to consider strategies that strengthen the adaptation capacity of farmers to climate change in East Africa.",0.9104562824870305,0.2162603610057741,0.10178828724816899,0.5377369768756024,0.024599434875641348,0.024115788391954673,0.04704787736395201
"Maple Syrup Producers of the Lake States, USA: Attitudes Towards and Adaptation to Social, Ecological, and Climate Conditions","Maple syrup is an important non-timber forest product derived from the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall). However, maple syrup producers are facing a diversity of challenges, including: potential range shifts in the maple resource; increasing variability in the timing, duration and yield of sap flow and syrup operations; invasive species, pests and diseases; and intergenerational land and business transfer challenges. Members of Maple Syrup Producer Associations in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan were surveyed to learn about their operations, adaptation strategies, concerns, and information needs. While many respondents indicated they have undertaken or plan to undertake adaptation activities, only 11% had done so out of specific concern over changing climate conditions. Climate-motivated activities included: being prepared to tap earlier and utilizing newer technology such as vacuum tubing or reverse osmosis to enhance sap collection and processing efficiency. Respondents were generally unlikely to consider planting climate-resilient maple cultivars or tapping trees other than sugar maple. They expressed the greatest concerns over tree health and forest pests, as well as their physical ability and family member interest to continue their operations. Boil season variability and weather issues were viewed with less concern. Respondents were generally optimistic that they can adapt to future conditions, likely in large measure through the adoption of new technologies, and they expect their syrup production levels to slightly increase in the future. If future climate scenarios play out, however, additional planning and adaptation strategies may be called for, particularly as they relate to forest health and productivity issues.",0.6943000459720248,0.28508842926619526,0.15689823186877158,0.33277380447596205,0.043827009910994495,0.03521472087185318,0.046336061904373074
Climate change responses among the Maasai Community in Kenya,"The impacts of climate change to the dryland areas of East Africa are especially strong, especially if it is considered that these areas have weak institutions and governance systems. Climate change has also affected many rural communities in a severe way, reducing crop yields and sometimes causing crop failure. In Kenya and Tanzania, where drylands cover over around 80 and 50% of their respective land areas, rural populations have been especially affected. Among them is the tribal group of the Maasai, legendary nomad warriors, who have been suffering from persistent droughts and the negative impacts on their cattle herds.

"Impacts and adaptations to the effects of climate change: A case study in a cattle community in Chiapas, Mexico","The climate change is a global phenomenon that consists of the variations of the climate, such the increase of the temperature and changes of the regime of rains, provoking floods, long droughts, among others; Causing environmental, economic and social impacts, considered one of the main threats for the humanity. Human groups living in rural areas that depend on the production of agriculture and livestock are more vulnerable to their effects. Chiapas, Mexico, is one of the states with the greatest social marginalization, more than half of its population is rural and its largest production is dual-purpose cattle breeding with extensive grazing system. Climate changes and their consequences have impacted livestock producers, who have changed their way of producing and their lifestyles. This document presents the effects, perceptions and adaptations to the current conditions of the climate by livestock farmers the Ejido Francisco I. Madero, municipality of Tecaptán, Chiapas. We applied surveys and interviews to 30 farmers. All livestock farmers agreed that there have been changes in the environment such increase in heat, cold and decreased rainfall. Livestock farmers say that the cause of climate change is due to logging the trees, soil contamination, air and water, agricultural and forestry fires and the use of agrochemicals. Livestock farmers mentioned that production has declined and have suffered economic losses due to damage to grazing areas, decrease in the reproductive rate due to caloric stress and the presence and increase of diseases. To counteract these effects, they have had to resort to changes such as the inclusion of genetically modified grazing and hybrid cattle breeds that have lower productive indexes but are more resistant to climate changes, as well as the implementation of silos that raising production costs.",0.9512491905322944,0.2387006320336079,0.07076634285109129,0.3653505207408167,0.026255483341537496,0.024723401999143378,0.04833830733465769

Low-Tech irrigation strategies for smallholder vegetable farmers in Kenya,"Climate change is making rainfall needed for horticultural production in Kenya more unreliable. Applied on-farm research and data from household panel surveys are collected within the framework of the interdisciplinary research project HORTINLEA, which stands for Horticultural Innovations and Learning for Improved Nutrition and Livelihood in East Africa. It is a research consortium of German, Kenyan, and Tanzanian universities and research institutes funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Of 1232 surveyed smallholders, 87% perceive climate variability and change; 32% of major shocks experienced are weather-related often causing lower yields. Climate change adaptation is limited to incremental activities, such as crop portfolio changes. Transformative strategies, such as investing in micro-irrigation are rare. In this study, costs and benefits of climate-smart water management and its adoption potential are investigated. A subterranean micro-irrigation system has been constructed in Kenya from easily accessible materials (low-tech).

"Characterization of cocoa production, income diversification and shade tree management along a climate gradient in Ghana","Reduced climatic suitability due to climate change in cocoa growing regions of Ghana is expected in the coming decades. This threatens farmers' livelihood and the cocoa sector. Climate change adaptation requires an improved understanding of existing cocoa production systems and farmers' coping strategies. This study characterized current cocoa production, income diversification and shade tree management along a climate gradient within the cocoa belt of Ghana. The objectives were to 1) compare existing production and income diversification between dry, mid and wet climatic regions, and 2) identify shade trees in cocoa agroforestry systems and their distribution along the climatic gradient. Our results showed that current mean cocoa yield level of 288 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in the dry region was significantly lower than in the mid and wet regions with mean yields of 712 and 849 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. In the dry region, farmers diversified their income sources with non-cocoa crops and off-farm activities while farmers at the mid and wet regions mainly depended on cocoa (over 80% of annual income). Two shade systems classified as medium and low shade cocoa agroforestry systems were identified across the studied regions. The medium shade system was more abundant in the dry region and associated to adaptation to marginal climatic conditions. The low shade system showed significantly higher yield in the wet region but no difference was observed between the mid and dry regions. This study highlights the need for optimum shade level recommendation to be climatic region specific.",0.9353683722312359,0.16982491705039143,0.10829305400775642,0.4542353497655537,0.020397395778969932,0.018857574263413765,0.022848686103471665

"Climate adaptation, local institutions, and rural livelihoods: A comparative study of herder communities in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, China","Climate variability has been evident on the Mongolian plateau in recent decades. Livelihood adaptation to climate variability is important for local sustainable development. This paper applies an analytical framework focused on adaptation, institutions, and livelihoods to study climate adaptation in the Mongolian grasslands. A household survey was designed and implemented in each of three broad vegetation types in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia. The analytical results show that livelihood adaptation strategies of herders vary greatly across the border between Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, China. Local institutions played important roles in shaping and facilitating livelihood adaptation strategies of herders. Mobility and communal pooling were the two key categories of adaptation strategies in Mongolia, and they were shaped and facilitated by local communal institutions. Storage, livelihood diversification, and market exchange were the three key categories of adaptation strategies in Inner Mongolia, and they were mainly shaped and facilitated by local government and market institutions. Local institutions enhanced but also at times undermined adaptive capacity of herder communities in the two countries, but in different ways. Sedentary grazing has increased livelihood vulnerability of herders to climate variability and change. With grazing sedentarization, the purchase and storage of forage has become an important strategy of herders to adapt to the highly variable climate. The multilevel statistical models of forage purchasing behaviors show that the strategies of livestock management, household financial capital, environmental (i.e., precipitation and vegetation growth) variability, and the status of pasture degradation were the major determinants of this adaptation strategy.

Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration Enhances Rural Livelihoods in Dryland West Africa,"Declining agricultural productivity, land clearance and climate change are compounding the vulnerability of already marginal rural populations in West Africa. 'Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration' (FMNR) is an approach to arable land restoration and reforestation that seeks to reconcile sustained food production, conservation of soils, and protection of biodiversity. It involves selecting and protecting the most vigorous stems regrowing from live stumps of felled trees, pruning off all other stems, and pollarding the chosen stems to grow into straight trunks. Despite widespread enthusiasm and application of FMNR by environmental management and development projects, to date, no research has provided a measure of the aggregate livelihood impact of community adoption of FMNR. This paper places FMNR in the context of other agroforestry initiatives, then seeks to quantify the value of livelihood outcomes of FMNR. We review published and unpublished evidence about the impacts of FMNR, and present a new case study that addresses gaps in the evidence-base. The case study focuses on a FMNR project in the district of Talensi in the semi-arid Upper East Region in Ghana. The case study employs a social return on investment analysis, which identifies proxy financial values for non-economic as well as economic benefits. The results demonstrate income and agricultural benefits, but also show that asset creation, increased consumption of wild resources, health improvements, and psycho-social benefits created more value in FMNR-adopting households during the period of the study than increases in income and agricultural yields.",0.7080044788219954,0.2931746181513501,0.12942555446610932,0.550810395694774,0.05021875957644411,0.04606279402102835,0.039052780375232306
Adaptation in rice-wheat based sodic agroecosystems: A case study on climate resilient farmers' practices,"Resource-poor farmers, living in marginal environments and more directly dependent on local natural resources, have developed location specific agricultural knowledge systems that help them to adapt to climatic variability. In this research, we documented farmers' perceptions of climatic variability and related adaptive practices in three selected hamlets of Azamgarh district of eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were collected with 60 farmers using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools and personal interview methods. We found that the farmers are experiencing climatic variability as reflected by reduced frequency of rains and increased rainfall intensity, and that the farmers' observations were consistent with climate data of the past 100 years (from 1901 to 2000), where at several intervals variations in rainfall were very high. To combat climatic variability among resource-poor community and sodic agroecosystems, farmers have developed, through trial and error, a number of adaptive practices in their subsistence agriculture. These include crop diversification, agronomic manipulations and mixed cropping. Small-scale and marginal farmers practice biodynamic agriculture, where they maintain more than 10 crop species with minimal use of external inputs. Soil type, season, nutrient demand, soil fertility, cost of cultivation and local ecological knowledge are all considerations in these systems. These farmers also use indigenous practices to manage the insect pests in their crops. These adaptations help farmers to reduce environmental risks and minimize crop failures, and thus enhance the livelihoods. Farmers consider their location specific crop systems to be ecologically sustainable, economically viable and culturally acceptable.",0.9936066521843812,0.1418700121115931,0.07648423159308339,0.6683044261539937,0.026398453640990912,0.0033676977424685374,0.009084877221393717
Climate variability and mitigation: perceptions and strategies adopted by traditional coffee growers in India,"The study explores coffee growers' perceptions of climate variability and their coping and adaptive strategies to a changing environment. The results are based on a survey conducted with 56 spatially distributed coffee growers from across the traditionally coffee-growing Kodagu district of Karnataka located in the Western Ghats of India. In general, the growers perceived an increase in temperature, delay in onset of monsoon and an erratic pattern in the distribution of rainfall. These qualitative perceptions were substantiated with the long-term weather data of the district. Growers' adaptive strategies for climate variability are composed of mainly agronomic management interventions and crop diversification. Besides, off-farm income diversification is adopted by a few coffee growers. The estimates of an ordered probit model indicated that coffee growers' age, size of land holding, decrease in yield, delay in monsoon, increase in temperature and unpredictability of seasons exert a positive influence on climate-risk ranking, whereas acreage under coffee and crop diversification inversely influenced the ranking of climate risk. The understanding of these perceptions helps shape synergistic strategies for adaptation and undertake long-term mitigation measures to reduce the vulnerability of the coffee sector, especially, the livelihood security of small coffee growers in India.",0.9177343630241109,0.23231267789869003,0.07455857456567976,0.6223509963355047,0.04298190536945609,0.018447004463650198,0.04817882768566482
Farm management decision and response to climate variability and change in Cte d'Ivoire,"This paper investigates threats to farm management in the northern and central region of Cte d'Ivoire, with a particular focus on climate-related threats. To this end, farmers' perception and adaptation strategies for climate change have been analyzed. The data were collected from 205 respondents by means of the Focus Groups method, and they were evaluated using a framework analysis. The main reported threats related to the implementation of farming activities are the high cost of inputs and the lack of technical support, which are followed by diseases, insects, and climate variations (scarcity of rains, strong winds, and high temperature). We find that most farmers have a strong perception of changes in climatic conditions. Their perceived impacts on the local environment through evidences like the disappearance of certain farming practices, occurrence of new insects, and the disruption of key time reference periods. Farmers mainly attempt to adapt by adjusting their agricultural calendar, adopting new short-season varieties, and using mixed cropping. We find that the most influential factors for farmers' adaptation behavior is lack of contact with extension services and the scarcity of rainfall. Our suggestions for future agricultural policies for better adaptation to climate change are to take into account farmers' perception, to provide suitable climate forecast, and to improve local technical support.",0.9312154353179886,0.22708381364899063,0.0908415008345516,0.4527164788119859,0.030553053429680444,0.030105896747706164,0.04242054595819783
"Adoption of multiple climate-smart agricultural practices in the Gangetic plains of Bihar, India","Purpose The adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs) is important for sustaining Indian agriculture in the face of climate change. Despite considerable effort by both national and international agricultural organizations to promote CSAPs in India, adoption of these practices is low. This study aims to examine the elements that affect the likelihood and intensity of adoption of multiple CSAPs in Bihar, India. Design/methodology/approach The probability and intensity of adoption of CSAPs are analyzed using multivariate and ordered probit models, respectively. Findings The results show significant correlations between multiple CSAPs, indicating that their adoptions are interrelated, providing opportunities to exploit the complementarities. The results confirm that both the probability and intensity of adoption of CSAPs are affected by numerous factors, such as demographic characteristics, farm plot features, access to market, socio-economics, climate risks, access to extension services and training. Farmers who perceive high temperature as the major climate risk factor are more likely to adopt crop diversification and minimum tillage. Farmers are less likely to adopt site-specific nutrient management if faced with short winters; however, they are more likely to adopt minimum tillage in this case. Training on agricultural issues is found to have a positive impact on the likelihood and the intensity of CSAPs adoption. Practical implications The major policy recommendations coming from of our results are to strengthen local institutions (public extension services, etc.) and to provide more training on CSAPs. Originality/value By applying multivariate and ordered probit models, this paper provides some insights on the long-standing discussions on whether farmers adopt CSAPs in a piecemeal or in a composite way.",0.9436951494341086,0.1856803070271102,0.0698585995014358,0.48470458764940144,0.03383288305043281,0.021260366786882152,0.025692407118475414
What motivates rural households to adapt to climate change?,"Climate change is likely to raise the frequency and severity of climate variability, rendering smallholder farmers increasingly vulnerable. This necessitates adaptation actions to mitigate potential losses. Based on farm household survey data collected from three Chinese mountain villages, the study examines farmers' adaptation measures in response to drought and factors driving motivations to adapt. The results show that climate risk perceptions and households' assessment of their own abilities to adapt are important determinants of proactive adaptation decisions, with the latter found a better predictor than the former. The influences of village context and farm income are also significant. By drawing attention to the vital roles of human cognition to stimulate adaptation responses, the study emphasizes the need for greater efforts to raise risk awareness and, more importantly, to equip households with a feeling of perceived capacity to adapt. This can be done by providing additional information on risk-reducing measures and how to implement them as well as to make them affordable. Adaptation can also be improved by continuing investment in developing agriculture and rural livelihoods, such as policy interventions that enhance farm income.",0.8713182489573221,0.2834009915451745,0.09103865937751567,0.47892367840013045,0.05859528433152042,0.03568513205736871,0.0775692088975586
"Farmers’ perception of climate change and adaptation strategies in the Dabus watershed, North-West Ethiopia","Introduction: This study is aimed at analyzing farmers’ perception and adaptation to climate change in the Dabus watershed. It is based on analysis of data collected from 734 randomly selected farm householdheads substantiated with Focus Group Discussions and field observations. Methods: The study employed descriptive methods to assess farmers’ perception of climate change, localindicators of climate change and types of adaptation measures exercised to cop up with the risk of the change in climate. The study also employed the Heckman sample selection model to analyze the two-stepprocess of adaptation to climate change which initially requires farmers’ perception that climate is changingprior to responding to the changes through adaptation measures. Results: Based on the model result educational attainment, the age of the head of the household, thenumber of crop failures in the past, changes in temperature and precipitation significantly influencedfarmers’ perception of climate change in wet lowland parts of the study area. In dry lowland condition,farming experience, climate information, duration of food shortage, and the number of crop failuresexperienced determined farmers’ perception of climate change. Farmers’ adaptation decision in both the wet and dry lowland conditions is influenced by household size, the gender of household head, cultivatedland size, education, farm experience, non-farm income, income from livestock, climate information, extension advice, farm-home distance and number of parcels. However, the direction of influence and significance level of most of the explanatory variables vary between the two parts of the study area. Conclusions: In line with the results, any intervention that promotes the use of adaptation measures toclimate change may account for location-specific factors that determine farmers' perception of climate change and adaptive responses thereof. © 2018, The Author(s).",0.9683643918105436,0.17062251951582597,0.0732885835863732,0.5,0.023366561728137683,0.0128830483858091,0.028482630385567247
"Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for Sustainability and Food Security of Cassava Farming Households in Lampung, Indonesia","Climate change causes significant impact on fluctuating agricultural production and food security. This study aimed to assess farmer's adaptation strategies to the impact of climate change in cassava farming and to analyze food security level of cassava farming households. The research was conducted in Gunung Agung Village and Gunung Batin Village, Terusan Nunyai Subdistrict, Central Lampung Regency. A total of 66 cassava farmers were selected through simple random sampling. Data analysis applied were descriptive analysis of food security level according to the definition of FAO and Ordinal Logit (Ologit) analysis. Results showed that an average of 5 climate change adaptation strategies were applied by cassava farmers. Food security level of majority of casava farming households was found to fall into the less secure category. Climate change adaptation strategy (1.56), land size (5.36), and price of rice (-0.004) were identified to affect food security of cassava farming households.",0.9798952562374913,0.18040358014646024,0.08333130452701852,0.6826893871817763,0.013781680559326855,0.019053412356023012,0.01596842053788216
"Assessing farmers' perspectives on climate change for effective farm-level adaptation measures in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan","Agriculture is considered as the backbone of the economy of Pakistan. However, current changes in climate have been adversely affecting agricultural productivity. In this paper, perceived impacts of climate change on agriculture and adaptation towards it have been studied in Charsadda district (lowlands) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan through extensive field surveys, involving 116 farm households. Results have revealed that climate change factors including fluctuating temperature, evidence of yearly long droughts, and a steady shift in rainfall patterns have pressured the agriculture sector and livelihoods of the local peasants. The staggering floods of 2010 and 2011 in Pakistan have evidenced severe climatic changes in Pakistan. These countrywide floods have washed fertile soil in the study area that has directly contributed to losses in agricultural yield and increased vector-borne diseases in crops. The local farmers have commonly deployed adaptive measure such as crops diversification, changing fertilizer, and planting shaded trees to minimize the impacts of changes in climate. However, these adjustments measures are perceived as not appropriate for improving farm yield. Therefore, the study suggests that improved understanding of the climate change impacts and knowledge on adapting adequately will lead to no-regret adaptation. It will also help protecting farmer's lives and livelihoods and will boost their resilience towards changing climatic conditions.",0.9312795613971407,0.21839909190433096,0.12094275958732892,0.47360935137021304,0.042494184452198006,0.020825711939446316,0.061892334976911885
FACTORS INFLUENCING RICE FARMERS' ADAPTATION STRATEGIES TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENT IMPACTS IN BANGLADESH,"Introduction: Climate change has emerged as a major threat to Bangladesh. Higher and fluctuating temperatures and changes in rainfall caused by climate change and extreme weather events have reduced crop production. A better understanding of the local dimensions of vulnerability is therefore essential to develop appropriate adaptation measures that can alleviate these adverse impacts. Purpose and methods: The main purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of Aman rice farmers' choice of adaptation strategies to climate change and weather in Khulna district, Bangladesh. About 100 farm households susceptible to salinity intrusion, extreme temperatures and drought were surveyed, and these data were supplemented by major climate data of the district for 65 years (1948-2013). A binary logistic regression was then utilized to estimate the factors that influence households' choice of adaptation strategies. Results and Conclusions: About 97% of farmers perceived that the climate had changed over the past 30 years while only 3% did not. Further, 97% believed that rainfall had decreased and reduced rice production, yet the data show this not to be the case with a significant increase in rainfall observed in the area in the study period. About 89% of farmers have undertaken some form(s) of adaptation and they were further asked about their main adaptation type. Family size, annual income, farmer-to-farmer extension and access to subsidies have a positive and significant impact on rice farmers' adaptation strategies to climate and weather change effects. Farm size and credit access had a negative and significant impact on adaptation. Four variables: age, education, household assets and occupation were not statistically significant in explaining adaption strategies. The chief adaptation strategies of farmers are cultivation of salinity-tolerant rice, rice variety switching, replanting of rice, changing planting dates, conversion of rice paddy to fish production and use of different crop varieties in alternate years.",0.99075169445755,0.17616108694663699,0.06292777424117929,0.646304233292842,0.0154411015916489,0.006235287102915404,0.010813966192966297

Climate adaptation of food value chains: the implications of varying consumer acceptance,"Despite there being considerable research and knowledge surrounding the risks of climate change on agricultural productivity, fewer studies have examined risks from a whole-of-chain perspective (i.e. from producer to consumer) and the perceptions of consumers about the climate adaptation strategies of food businesses. This paper presents the findings of a survey of 1532 Australian consumers and how they might respond to a food company's climate adaptation strategy. Three respondent archetypes, 'Eco-warriors' (n = 557), 'Undecideds' (n = 600) and 'Abdicators' (n = 375), were identified based on their perceptions of risks associated with climate change and their attitudes towards climate adaptation. Further analysis was carried out to understand how each group of respondents would respond to adaptation strategies employed by food companies. Based on the findings of this study, two main challenges are presented for food value chains: (1) translating consumer needs and preferences to niche opportunities arising from adaptation and (2) understanding how best to communicate adaptation benefits based on varying attitudes and information needs. By addressing these challenges, synergies between adaptation goals and competitive strategies in food value chains may be achieved.",0.7733044058353981,0.328431795820162,0.09713267008704746,0.40329695025855455,0.06430148454248025,0.05187117166986733,0.05645766559566291
Building climate change resilience through adaptation in smallholder farming systems in semi-arid Zimbabwe,"Purpose - This study aimed to determine factors that increase resilience and cause smallholder farmers to adapt better to climate change and vulnerability. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the authors used the vulnerability to resilience model and binary logit model to analyse the factors influencing household decisions to adapt. Findings - Households with increased access to climate information through extension services were likely to have better adaptation abilities. It was also shown that younger farmers were likely to adapt to climate change given their flexibility to adopt new techniques and their access and use of modern information and technology. Larger households were found to have higher probability of adapting as most adaptation strategies are labour intensive. Household's possession of livestock and access to credit significantly enhanced adaptation. However, households with higher farm income have lesser incentives to adapt to because their current farming practices might already be optimum. Research limitations/implications - Given that most of the smallholder farmers are vulnerable, such as women-headed households and the elderly, who are labour constrained, there is need for research and development of labour saving technologies to increase resilience to climate change and vulnerability. Originality/value - These findings underscore the importance of enabling farmer access to information and better technologies which enable them to increase adaptive capacity and resilience.",0.9675689029238791,0.20990562799356965,0.06183513105789474,0.6888710099349481,0.032217928002608184,0.016698915662336482,0.021504284729254402
The Impact of Climatic Change Adaptation on Agricultural Productivity in Central Chile: A Stochastic Production Frontier Approach,"Adaptation to climate change is imperative to sustain and promote agricultural productivity growth, and site- specific empirical evidence is needed to facilitate policy making. Therefore, this study analyses the impact of climate change adaptation on productivity for annual crops in Central Chile using a stochastic production frontier approach. The data come from a random sample of 265 farms located in four municipalities with different agro-climatic conditions. To measure climate change adaptation, a set of 14 practices was used in three different specifications: binary variable, count and index; representing decision, intensity and quality of adaptation, respectively. The aforementioned alternative variables were used in three different stochastic production frontier models. Results suggest that the use of adaptive practices had a significant and positive effect on productivity; the practice with the highest impact on productivity was irrigation improvement. Empirical results demonstrate the relevance of climate change adaptation on farmers' productivity and enrich the discussion regarding the need to implement adaptation measures.",0.7934488213538826,0.2591695050878293,0.09315809673534318,0.3526409683910809,0.0466792335470633,0.03805378571555484,0.02133256141606146
"Climate change adaptation: a panacea for food security in Ondo State, Nigeria","This paper examines the likely perceived causes of climate change, adaptation strategies employed and technical inefficiency of arable crop farmers in Ondo State, Nigeria. Data were obtained from primary sources using a set of structured questionnaire assisted with interview schedule. Multistage sampling technique was used. Data were analyzed using the following: descriptive statistics and the stochastic frontier production function. The findings showed that majority of the respondents (59.1 %) still believed that climate change is a natural phenomenon that is beyond man's power to abate while industrial release, improper sewage disposal, fossil fuel use, deforestation and bush burning were perceived as the most human factors that influence climate change by the category that chose human activities (40.9 %) as the main causes of climate change. The main employed adaptation strategies by the farmers were mixed cropping, planting early matured crop, planting of resistant crops and use of agrochemicals. The arable crop farmers were relatively technically efficient with about 53 % of them having technical efficiency above the average of 0.784 for the study area. The study observed that education, adaptation, perception, climate information and farming experience were statistically significant in decreasing inefficiency of arable crop production. Therefore, advocacy on climate change and its adaptation strategies should be intensified in the study area.",0.9730843945532638,0.15206195678848114,0.06561260977676153,0.5561034872329332,0.03338674596791053,0.012202168346058669,0.015601644103456611
"Climate variability, farmland value, and farmers' perceptions of climate change: implications for adaptation in rural Pakistan","Many studies have examined the impact of climatic variability on agricultural productivity, although an understanding of these effects on farmland values and their relationship to farmers' decisions to adapt and modify their land-use practices remains nascent in developing nations. We estimated the impacts of the deviation in our study year's (2012) temperature and precipitation patterns from medium-term (1980-2011) climatic patterns on farmland values in Pakistan. This was accomplished by employing a modified form of a Ricardian regression model. We also examined farmers' perceptions of climate change during this period, as well as their perceptions of climate change impacts on farm productivity, in addition to past and anticipated farm adaptation strategies. Our results indicate that positive temperature deviation from the medium-term mean - indicative of climatic change - affects farmland values in Pakistan. Deviation in annual cumulative precipitation conversely appears to have no significant impact. Estimates of the marginal impact of temperature deviation suggested a slight but negative linear relationship with farmland values. The location of farms in areas where farmers can avail financial or extension services conversely had a positive impact on farmland values, as did the availability of irrigation facilities. Our analysis of farmers' perceptions of climate change and their consequent adaptation behavior indicated a relatively high degree of awareness of climatic variability that influenced a number of proactive and future anticipated farm adaptation strategies. Examples included increased use of irrigation and farm enterprise diversification, as well as land-use change, including shifting from agriculture into alternative land uses. National policy in Pakistan underscores the importance of maintaining a productive rural agricultural sector. Our findings consequently highlight the importance of appropriate adaptation strategies to maintain both farm productivity and farmland values in much of Pakistan. The implications of increased extension and financial services to enhance farmers' potential for climate change adaptation are discussed.",0.9438666639609778,0.22584653442087024,0.10101963089842118,0.49192160889507136,0.02869631028610472,0.015954114844344256,0.02666554438461803
The effects of adaptation to climate change on income of households in rural Ethiopia,"Climate change is one of the most serious impediments to agricultural prosperity in Ethiopia, especially where livestock is concerned. In particular, rural farming communities in the drylands of the Afar region are severely exposed to the impacts of climate change, with stark reminders from repeating droughts followed by crop failure and livestock decimation. Locals have a long history of applying adaptation measures to maintain their sustenance. However, a growing literature challenges whether these traditional methods can continue to sustain local livelihoods. This study identifies how pastoral, semi-pastoral, agro-pastoral and mixed-farming communities in Afar perceive and adapt to climate change and whether these practices have brought about any improvement in farm income. A panel data set of five years was gathered using structured questionnaires from a sample of 313 households. Household heads pointed out indicators to identify climate-related stress such as erratic rainfall, drought, temperature change, drying of water sources, prevalence of diseases and lack of human and livestock feed. A fixed effects quantitative model on the panel data was estimated to verify the effect of adaptation strategies on income of household heads. We found that the main adaptation strategies that significantly influenced household income levels were forage production (hay and straw), access to water sources, livestock diversification and migration. The implication is that people severely affected by climate change and living in a situation demanding urgent solutions can actively apply various adaptation strategies if the strategies are linked to the creation of sustainable income benefits. Thus, integrated approaches comprising adaptation methods and expected benefits are an important way to induce farming communities to address challenges related to climatic change.",0.9362227194195294,0.23877510053751957,0.11344771364525484,0.5574148875469986,0.0375496662592439,0.02055924338928005,0.07959017027560529
U.S. Inland Pacific Northwest Wheat Farmers' Perceived Risks: Motivating Intentions to Adapt to Climate Change?,"The Regional Approaches to Climate Change for the Pacific Northwest Agriculture (REACCH PNA) project was a USDA-National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) funded effort aimed at taking a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to understanding the implications of climate change on wheat and other cereal crop production in the inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW).As part of this project, two comprehensive surveys of wheat producers were conducted in 2012/13 and 2015/16, which included questions concerning production practices, risk perception, and attitudes towards climate change adaptation and mitigation. This paper explores farmers' anticipated adaptive responses to climate change across five different adaptation strategies, including, cropping system, crop rotation, tillage practices, soil conservation practices, and crop insurance. This research examines whether farmers anticipate making little to no change or moderate to big changes to their production system in response to climate change and whether perceived economic and environmental risks motivate farmers' intentions to adapt to climate change. I found that a small percentage (18-28%) of respondents intend on taking moderate to big action in response to predicted climate change, across both surveys and all five adaptation strategies. Further, high levels of perceived economic and environmental risks, associated with climate change and positive attitudes towards adaptation, are motivating intentions to adapt.",0.9206446738280113,0.23098576876671828,0.13358384555543493,0.37077727923526327,0.059689411003809194,0.026080695733019577,0.035096027891223125
Sedentarization as Constrained Adaptation: Evidence from Pastoral Regions in Far Northwestern China,"This paper examines the effect of a state-led sedentarization scheme on pastoralist adaptation in northern Xinjiang, China. Drawing on surveys and semi-structured interviews with 159 Kazak pastoral households, our results indicate that socio-environmental challenges made extensive herding more tenuous but less profitable. Consequently, certain pastoralists voluntarily adopted sedentarization under state facilitation, although this process was accompanied with declines in household income and asset holdings. Our findings suggest that pastoralists were subject to the combined effects of institutional push and socio-environmental risks, making sedentarization seemingly the only viable choice. We thus argue that pastoral sedentarization in northern Xinjiang represents a constrained adaptation strategy. Future policy should build on pastoralists' motivation to sedentarize and seek their knowledge to facilitate adaptive development in the pastoral regions.",0.6152110185880364,0.35303875292264175,0.12619386034268498,0.48719765938699994,0.05826816941898357,0.06286165657344198,0.0726289556085342
"Risk and vulnerability due to climate change and adaptation initiatives for agricultural resilience in Panna district of Madhya Pradesh, central India","Present study assessed farmers' perception on risk and vulnerability due to climate change and adaptive initiations to achieve resilience in agriculture by conducting survey of ten selected villages in Panna district of Bundelkhand region in the year 2011. The findings revealed that the farmers had clear, cut perception of changing climatic scenarios and realized wide scale impact on agriculture and allied activities. The deviation in weather pattern, monsoon rain, wind and dust storm, and increase in unusual weather extremes has put agricultural production system at risk. Change in phenology of crops manifested by deviation in flowering time and intensity, fruit-bearing pattern, shape, size and quality of grain clearly indicated risk to biodiversity. Similarly, livestock productivity was perceived to be at risk due to change in weather and climate. The farmers of study area have taken some adaptation initiatives for minimizing risk in farming activities, livestock production and coping with extreme weather events. Modification in sowing time of crops and cropping sequence and adoption of agroforestry land use by planting trees on field boundaries and home-yard were main adaptation strategies to achieve resilience in agriculture.",0.9597669694967439,0.2096304526613226,0.07712049257026043,0.5074796931506529,0.019906901482848845,0.020204271405623617,0.04862866563272639
Climate change adaptation and the African fisheries: evidence from the UNFCCC National Communications,"Climate change can cause significant (un)foreseen changes in the fisheries sector.

Climate change transformations in Nordic agriculture?,"Climate change is expected to have negative impacts but also to bring potential opportunities for agriculture and crop productivity in the Nordic countries. Little research has been conducted at the farmer level to identify what adaptation measures are being considered or already taken and transformative these are. Based on semi-structured interviews with farmers and extension officers from two of the most fertile agricultural areas of Finland and Sweden, this study examines to what extent Nordic farmers are engaged in transforming their farming systems. The results show that some transformational changes are taking place already but most changes are incremental. Currently, agricultural policies and regulations are perceived as a greater adaptation challenge than climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Climate adaptation and governance and small-scale farmers’ vulnerability through artificial glacier technology: Experiences from the cold desert of leh in North-West Himalaya, India","In the context of ongoing climate change, the critical factors for the livelihood and environmental sustainability of small farmers are the resilience and the capacity to cope using little technology, which needs to be strengthened to manage climate resilience. This paper uses several methods to examine the vulnerability and livelihood interaction between small farmers, especially how they cope and adapt to climate variability using artificial glacier technology. This case study can be used to draw lessons to support the climate adaptation strategies for small farmers and enhance their resilience to livelihood stresses. The study is based on the primary data and information collected from 675 households in 27 villages of Leh (Ladakh) in north-west Himalaya, India, and reveals that 61.18 % of the population is fully supporting their livelihoods from agriculture and allied activities. With increased irrigation potential due to the use of artificial glaciers, food security has been assured to 77.56 % of the poor smallholder households and health vulnerability has been reduced in 31 % of the households. The seasonal migration has declined in nearly two-thirds of smallholder households as a diversification mechanism, thereby improving their livelihood strategies. The use of tactical adaptations by small farmers in response to the persistent droughts such as the selling of livestock, expanding agricultural lands, and the use of relief cash and food has declined to 20.44, 24.74, and 63 % of smallholder households, respectively. However, these measures are unsustainable in the long term. How should the policy makers and other societal stakeholders act in this context? To address the small farmers’ livelihood challenges in the context of climate change, the role of innovative technology is vital to improve climate adaptations and governance using a multidisciplinary approach involving multilateral collaboration among different stakeholders. The presence of social entrepreneurs (the new actors on the adaptation scene) is necessary to bring forth the necessary measures. To this end, better linking of science and technology policies together with other policies should be encouraged. The social transfers through better health care, access to safe drinking water, better sanitary conditions, and improved standards of education and infrastructure are the win-win measures to enhance the community’s adaptive capacity, which requires significant amounts of additional investment. Besides, developing the institutional mechanisms for specific adaptation interventions can be one of most effective ways of implementing a plan and achieving the expected outcome. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",0.9004993899911492,0.29796979460617046,0.07727479804688445,0.6786604305028705,0.045767021209697195,0.03507976813678077,0.08719598212731221
"Using a mixed-method approach to explore the spatiality of adaptation practices of tomato farmers to climate variability in the Offinso North District, Ghana","There is a general scientific consensus that anthropogenic forces are the major cause of global climatic changes. The study explored the spatiality of adaptation strategies of farmers to climate variability in the Offinso North District of Ghana using the mixed method approach. Structured questionnaire and focus group discussion guide were the data collection instruments for a cross-section of 378 tomato farmers in selected study communities in the District. Farmers demonstrated their awareness of climatic changes through some characteristics such temperature rise, unpredictable and reduction in rainfall, incidence of floods, intensity in solar radiation and prolong drought conditions. The study also showed that tomato farmers in the study communities employed both on-farm and off-farm adaptive strategies in response to the effects of climate variability on tomato production. Spatially, mixed cropping, crop diversification, application of agrochemicals, changes in farm location, changes in crop variety, irrigation, migration and diversification to non-farm activities were the adaptation practices of the farmers. Spatially, the on-farm adaptation strategies were uniformly practiced across the study communities unlike the off-farm adaptation practices that slightly varied across space. The regression results showed that location has significant influence on some adaptation practices, especially changes in farm location (p<.005), changes in crop variety (p<.005), application of agrochemicals (p<.005) and irrigation practices (p.005). An enabling environment should be created by the government to enable the youth get access to finance and other subsidized farming logistics (e.g. modern irrigation logistics) to boost their morale in the tomato business.",0.9896915116718885,0.19343640037399593,0.07619192498352656,0.669154501862791,0.02777260145686174,0.007240137603913196,0.01566853897435224

The case study is in Western Victoria, Australia, part of a major dairy farming region that contributes 26 per cent of national milk production and 86 per cent of the country's dairy exports. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilised a survey and semi-structured interviews in Corangamite Shire, to document dairy farmers' perceptions of climate variability and the adaptation strategies they have implemented, compared to meteorological data collected on climate variability in the recent past. Findings - Farmers in this region perceive a change in rainfall and temperature broadly in line with meteorological records. Those that have experienced a greater degree of climate variability in drier regions were found to perceive it more accurately. Almost all respondents had already made changes to their dairy businesses, but in doing so only a small percentage were responding directly to seasonal variability or to longer term changes (9 and 15 per cent, respectively); the majority said they were responding to changing economic conditions in the industry. Originality/value - A primary survey of dairy farming adds to knowledge of how climate variability is perceived, and how it is adapted to in a region heavily reliant on rainfall for its prime economic activity.",0.906748341410224,0.24687451924805823,0.05979066621455794,0.5685710507165763,0.04535058660283742,0.02921501259947188,0.07022919652883432
"Climate Change Information Source and Indigenous Adaptation Strategies of Cucumber Farmers in Enugu State, Nigeria","The study assessed the climate change information source and the indigenous adaptation strategies of cucumber farmers in Enugu State. A multi-stage sampling technique was used in selecting 80 respondents. Data were elicited using structured interview schedule and presented in percentage and mean scores. Findings showed that the majority (92.5%) of cucumber farmers never had contact with extension workers. Information on climate change was mainly from neighbours/friends and personal experience. The indigenous strategies employed for climate change adaptation were organic manure ((x) over bar =2.91), crop diversification (=2.75), early harvesting ((x) over bar =2.74) planting early maturing varieties ((x) over bar =2.59), prompt weeding ((x) over bar =2.79) among others. The major challenges encountered by the respondents included poor market facility ((x) over bar =2.36), non-availability of credit facility (x) over bar =2.74), non- availability of storage facilities ((x) over bar =2.75), high cost of labour ((x) over bar =2.48), poor access to information sources ((x) over bar =2.30), limited income ((x) over bar =2.58). It was recommended that high level awareness via media campaign be employed by government extension agency to educate cucumber farmers on climate change issues. Also, a sustainable national climate change policy should be championed by the Ministry of Agriculture to build farmers capability to adapt to climate change. Also, government should intervene in the issues of credit, input/facilities and map out a framework to guarantee access to land by farmers for enhanced resilience and expand of production.",0.947847258570559,0.21978767640101976,0.0886516913108412,0.5897618351088328,0.025287736374860117,0.02080228552861981,0.020796261188581282
"Farmers' adaptation to water scarcity in drought-prone environments: A case study of Rajshahi District, Bangladesh","Water scarcity and droughts pose serious threats to the livelihood of farming communities and the economy in many parts of the world. Using a survey of 546 farming households and employing multinomial logit regression, this study investigates rice farmers' adaptation to water scarcity in a semi-arid climate in Bangladesh. It identified factors determining farmers' adaptation responses to addressing water scarcity. The analysis shows that farmers with more experience of farming, better schooling, more secure tenure rights, better access to electricity and institutional facilities and an awareness of climatic effects are more likely to adopt alternative adaptation strategies. Farmers' alternative adaptation choices are examined in comparison to the traditional approach of groundwater irrigation. This study raises issues of sustainability of agricultural adaptation practices in the context of an increasing dependence on groundwater irrigation. The results provide an insight to sustainable irrigation practices and an understanding of the characteristics of farms and farming households to frame better strategies to cope with water-stressed regimes in drought-prone environments.

"Farmers' risk perception, vulnerability, and adaptation to climate change in rural Pakistan","Pakistan is the world's most susceptible country to extreme climatic events, such as floods and droughts. This study aims to investigate the risks related to climate variability and the adaptation measures utilized by farm households in their farms to cope with the adverse shocks of climatic disasters. A dataset of 600 respondents was collected using structured questionnaire from four districts namely Charsadda, Mardan, Nowshera and Peshawar of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Findings of the research showed that soil fertility loss, water scarcity, changes in crop yields and crop diseases were the main determinants of climate variability. Further study participants were also utilizing several adaptation techniques such as change in crop type and variety, change fertilizer, seed quality, pesticide, plant shade trees; water storage and farm diversification. Results of our study further showed that in the study area, study participants were facing various constraints in adoption of certain adaptation measures to deal with climate variability, such as shortage of labor, insecure land tenure system, lack of market access, poverty, land of governmental support, lack of access to assets, lack of water sources, lack of credit sources and lack of knowledge and information were the main constraints faced by the farm households. Findings of this research provide useful insights to the responsible authorities for policy implementation. Our study further suggests that the government should provide proper support to the farmers in the shape of access to farm inputs, access to information and extension services on climate variability and adaptation.",0.9716358650998642,0.18828302375998734,0.054639418084030354,0.6979163291420164,0.02644530374870574,0.01570800383122632,0.094548450700684
Adaptation strategies to climatic variability: A case study of small-scale farmers in rural Mexico,"Climate change is predicted to have major consequences for small-scale farmers in the developing rural areas of the world. Rural areas, nonetheless, harbor opportunities to mitigate global climate changes. Identification of innovative adaptation strategies used by small-scale farmers, therefore, is crucial in order to understand the extent of their implications. This paper identifies the relationships between livelihood units and landscapes that they depend upon, in a small-scale farm community. It examines their experiences of increasing climatic variability, and how the different groups in the community are adapting to it. The study was conducted in a typical rural ejido community on the Pacific coast of Mexico (Ejido Ticuiz), where a detailed socio-cultural profile was obtained by means of semi-structured interviews. In the study area we encountered a range of individual and community-based adaptation strategies, built on farmers' recognition of the different types of landscapes which supply goods and benefits. Small-scale farmers have used their landscape diversity to build adaptation strategies to guarantee the supply of goods and benefits to cope with uncertain of climate events. Households rather than individuals or the community as an institution were depicted as the core socio-cultural group for better understanding of patterns, behavior and aspirations related to climate change adaptation at local level. The adaptation capacities of rural communities could be significantly strengthened if political, financial and institutional support is targeted at households rather than at individuals or the community level only.

Assessing the determinants of rice farmers' adaptation strategies to climate change in Bangladesh,"Purpose - This paper aims to examine rice farmers' selection of adaptation strategies to cope with and offset the effects of climate change and the determinants of those selections in Rajshahi, a severely drought-prone district of Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach - Farm-level micro data were obtained from 550 rice growers in the 2010-2011 farming season. A multinomial logit (MNL) model was utilised to assess the determinants of adaptation strategies practised by farmers in response to climate change. Findings - Results from the MNL model indicate that gender, age, education of household heads, household assets, annual farm income, farm size, tenure status, farmer-to-farmer extension, access to credit, access to subsidy, and access to electricity, all affect farmers' selection of adaptation strategies for climate change. Originality/value - This is the first study of its kind to analyse the determinants of adaptation strategies for climate change by farmers in drought-prone areas of Bangladesh. This study provides direction for policy makers in order to strengthen the adaptation strategies of farmers and guide policies accordingly. These strategies have the potential to minimise the adverse effects of climate change.",0.9758369005386582,0.15132143464390327,0.04396591674312222,0.809951742511536,0.03523998999062336,0.012221987846463698,0.010401631749008487
Determinants of farm-level adaptation diversity to cyclone and flood: insights from a farm household-level survey in Eastern India,"A large number of farmers' livelihoods are susceptible to cyclones and floods, and farmers are taking up several adaptation mechanisms. Previous studies, therefore, have examined determinants of various adaptation options and provide policy suggestions to promote a specific one. However, options are undertaken at different points depending on the nature and intensity of extreme events. Hence, it is imperative to identify factors influencing farmers' decisions to adopt an additional option, particularly during ex-ante and ex-post periods. This could assist policy-makers to enhance various farm-level adaptation options. Using survey data from 285 farm households in cyclone- and flood-prone regions in eastern India, this study aims to assess the determinants of adaptation diversity. This study finds that the likelihood of undertaking adaptation diversity is high during the ex-post period, and cyclone-affected farmers are likely to adopt a higher number of adaptation measures. Further, size of household, farming experience, per capita income, agriculture as major source of income and crop loss compensation received are some of the important determinants. These findings emphasize the need for investments in scientific modeling for better prediction of extreme events and suggest restructuring the existing institutions to promote several farm-level adaptation measures.",0.878466583556445,0.25865854074716665,0.06771922849238117,0.5332830003039559,0.07372585621065705,0.06776035506500143,0.10145841773329081
The role of agroforestry in building livelihood resilience to floods and drought in semiarid Kenya,"Climate change may create serious problems for farmers by increasing precipitation variability and drought and flood events. Understanding how to build livelihood resilience to these effects is a pressing need. Agroforestry is one potential solution. Although many people intuitively link agroforestry with livelihood resilience to floods and drought, little comprehensive empirical evidence exists. Here, we strive to answer the call for more empirical evidence by drawing on field work in Isiolo County, Kenya to ask the research question: How does agroforestry help smallholder farmers build livelihood resilience to floods and drought? We used a mixed- methods approach that included 20 qualitative case study households and 338 quantitative household surveys. Our major findings are: (1) practicing agroforestry can influence perceptions of floods and drought, (2) specific environmental and livelihood benefits of agroforestry contribute to livelihood resilience, and (3) agroforestry directly and indirectly builds livelihood resilience to floods and drought. Identifying potential climate change adaptation strategies is crucial for smallholder farmers. Our research indicates that agroforestry is one promising option.",0.8269982370961484,0.2995774777971223,0.08684466668636522,0.5632444689135412,0.0288767114972725,0.03953168312571536,0.1700978557397438
"Climate change beliefs, risk perceptions, and adaptation behavior among Midwestern U.S. crop farmers","Global climate change presents unique challenges to the resilience of United States agriculture, and farmers and advisors must utilize effective adaptation strategies to be both economically and environmentally sustainable. This study addresses Midwestern U.S. crop farmers' beliefs about climate change, perceived risks from weather and climate, and attitudes toward adaptation that influence their decisions to adopt adaptation strategies. Analyzing a 2012 survey of nearly 5000 corn farmers across 22 Midwestern U.S. Watersheds, we investigate the most common weather and climate risk management strategies, including purchasing additional crop insurance, implementing conservation practices, and adding new technology. U.S. farmers' belief in anthropogenic climate change, perceptions of changing weather patterns, climate risks to their farm and attitudes toward adapting are analyzed. Farmers' perceptions of risk to their own farm, attitudes toward innovation and adaptation attitudes were the most important determinants of adaptation. This study highlights the critical role of risk perceptions in adaptation attitudes as well as behaviors among agriculturalists. Finally, we discuss how these findings could be applied to increase uptake of adaptation strategies and thus resilience of U.S. agriculture to a changing climate. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Understanding Farmers' Perceptions and Risk Responses to Climate Change in China,"Agriculture is likely to bear the brunt of the impacts of climate change. The extent to which these impacts are felt depends in large part on the extent of adaptation in response to climate change. The overall aim of this paper is to attempt to identify farmers' knowledge, perceptions and risk responses towards climate change (or potential change). In order to achieve this goal, several specific objectives are pursued. First, the paper investigates whether or not farmers have perceived the long-term climate change and extreme weather events. Second, the paper describes how farmers respond to climate change and tries to assess the determinants of their adaptation. Based on data collected from a survey among farm households in three provinces in rural China, the findings demonstrate that farmers are aware of climate variability and identify the rising temperature, decreasing precipitation and the increasing frequency of drought. Only about 25% of farmers are willing to adjust their farming structures as a risk reaction. Household size, wealth, farm size, and the number of plots are found to be important factors that influence farmer adaptive capacity. Implications for policy-making on agriculture and adaptation to climate change will be to focus on providing farmers with information about the climate in time and facilitating enhancement of their adaptive capacity.",0.96646684880506,0.19259506731478976,0.07430523259588168,0.44581328408156246,0.010581541496489297,0.01172956773078751,0.04968436831486298
Responses to climate change and farming policies by rural communities in northern China: A report on field observation and farmers' perception in dryland north Shaanxi and Ningxia,"To address land degradation and rural poverty the Chinese government has put in place a series of land conversion programmes in the Loess Plateau area in northern China. In addition to problems arising from unsustainable land use, water resource availability driven in part by climatic forcing is also a threat to livelihoods in this region. To understand climate impacts on farming practice in poor areas of China, field observation and village reconnaissance took place in the summer of 2009 in three selected counties of Shaanxi and Ningxia Province, northern China. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with householders in rural communities aiming to explore the impacts of recent climate and environmental changes and the role of land management practices on individual and community livelihood incomes as well as individual understanding and engagement with these concepts. The findings were complemented with secondary agricultural, economic and climatic data from the study regions. Respondents argued that land conversion programmes improved income potential, sustainability of livestock grazing and environmental quality in the region. However, water availability was thought to increasingly limit agriculture and human wellbeing in some of the regions with water resources becoming notably scarcer. Understanding of climate change as a concept varied amongst farmers potentially hampering the ability to adapt existing farming practices to maximise livelihood incomes sustainably. Positive effects of the government's land management schemes were unevenly distributed within villages and amongst regions, often linked to a lack of knowledge transfer and shared resources resulting in marginalised households and/or communities. Off-farm labour (in many cases relating to young adult rural to urban migration) appears a crucial source of income for households in the study region. Respondents in Ningxia expressed reservations about the future prospect of productive farming if the water availability continued to diminish. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"The adaptive and coping strategies of pastoralists to climate change in Baringo, Laikipia and Nyeri counties of Kenya","Production of pasture and fodder grasses is low in the Kenya’s rangelands as a result of unreliable and low rainfall regimes. A sustainable livelihood in the region is threatened by climate change due to frequent droughts and erratic rainfall. Technologies aimed at increasing rural communities’ resilience are necessary to support their capacity to adapt and respond to new hazards. In view of this, a baseline survey was conducted to identify and document local climate change adaptation and coping mechanisms in livestock feeds and feeding systems among the livestock keepers in Baringo, Laikipia and Nyeri counties of Kenya. Results obtained from the study showed that over 60% of respondents in Laikipia did not attend school, as compared to literacy levels in other study counties of Nyeri and Baringo (45 and 39% respectively). Lack of feeds was cited as the most important livestock keeping constraints in Nyeri county (61%), whereas lack of water was mentioned by most of the respondents in Laikipia and Baringo counties (50 and 38% respectively). Migration to search for greener pastures and safety was the main coping strategy to drought and floods in Baringo (97%) and Laikipia (64%). In Nyeri however, mobility as a coping strategy was almost non-existence (99%). Water harvesting was most important coping strategy (67%) in Nyeri county. With respect to adoption of improved climate change adaptation strategies, Nyeri county recorded the highest number of adopters, >174>128 respectively). Off-farm purchase of feed supplements as a coping strategy was highly recorded in Nyeri county (61%). However, in Laikipia and Baringo counties, feed supplementation was hardly used, with a mention of 44 and 43% respectively. The study shows majority of the respondents from Baringo county were seeking for agricultural information from various sources namely; newspapers (100%), NGOs (100%), television (80%), chiefs’ ‘baraza’(80%) and a small number (45%) from village elders. Higher percentage of respondents in Nyeri county received agricultural information through the extension (100%), while in Laikipia county, village elders were the main source of agricultural information (42%). It is concluded that livestock as mainstay in Laikipia and Baringo counties is more vulnerable to climate change than in Nyeri. However, although efficient agricultural information channels were used in Nyeri county, the high recorded cases of purchasing feeds off-farm is a challenge in adapting to climate change for a sustainable livelihood in this region. © 2015, Fundacion CIPAV.

"Knowledge, Attitude and Practice of Smallholder Farmers Regarding Climate Change and Agroforestry: A Case Study of Farmers in Penablanca, Cagayan","Climate change threatens to derail the lives and livelihoods of farmers all over the world if appropriate adaptation measures are notput in place. Smallholder farmers, more so those in developing countries like the Philippines, are especially at risk because of inherent socio-economic characteristic and environmental factors limiting their capacity to adapt. One adaptation measure that can potentially benefit smallholder farmers is agroforestry. However limited understanding, incorrect information and a negative mindset could hinder the successful adoption of this practice. This case study of smallholder farmers in Penablanca, Cagayan, Philippines attempts to explain the farmers' adaptation practices by analyzing their knowledge and attitudes on climate change and agroforestry. Two sets of surveys, one on adaptation practices (n=600) and one on knowledge and attitudes (n=41) were conducted with smallholder farmers in Pefiablanca. Most farmers are aware of the basic concepts of climate change (91%) and agroforestry (84%), specifically of the impacts of climate extremes on their farms and of the benefits of agroforestry. However this may not always translate to correct practice of agroforestry and other adaptation measures. It is recommended that information, education, and communication programs on climate change and agroforestry for farmers should present targeted information on impacts and adaptation in a way that is relatable and understandable to them.",0.9626874916390168,0.20427461022539906,0.08595874798242135,0.443933273775804,0.019837174585393955,0.01838817124957172,0.024076504082992296
Adaptation of Iranian farmers to climate variability and change,"Climate change poses serious challenges for populations whose livelihoods depend principally on natural resources. Given the increases in extreme weather events projected to adversely affect the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran, adaptation of the agricultural sector is imperative. Few studies have addressed the farmers' adaptation in Iran, and little is known about ongoing adaptation strategies in use. Adopting principal component analysis/fuzzy logic-based method, this paper considers the agricultural adaptation to climate variability. A survey of 255 farmers of Fars Province, selected through a multistage stratified random sampling method, revealed different levels of adaptation, specifically the low, moderate and high, which are principally distinguished by various degrees of sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The study also identified the main adaptation strategies used by farmers in response to climate-related shocks. Results indicated that although a large percentage of farmers make some adjustments to their farming practices, there are significant differences in choice of adaptation strategies by the adaptation categories. Some conclusions and recommendations are offered to increase the adaptive capacity of farmers and reduce negative impacts of climate variability and change.",0.9581995002110518,0.22158691963043115,0.05809381581696974,0.5955640322915257,0.05895128717878873,0.018040967751531956,0.05825321395452247
Local creativity for adapting to climate change among rural farmers in the semi-arid region of Ghana,"Purpose - Climate change has emerged as an important theme in the current food security discourses, and although research on local people's adaptation to climate change is increasing, more research is needed to enable sharing of different coping strategies. This research can help policymakers in documenting effective coping strategies that helped to reduce negative impacts of climate change on farmers. The research therefore determined how farmers in rural Ghana use traditional knowledge to adapt to climate changes, and how well the local knowledge worked to enhance livelihoods. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The study took place in three communities in Ghana. Sixty participants consisting 20 from each of the communities were recruited for the study. Data were collected through focus group discussions and semi-structured interview questions. SPSS software was used to analyse the data The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to rank the strategies in enhancing livelihoods. Findings - Men's and women's understanding of what constitute climate change are similar - change in the rainfall amount and distribution. The coping strategies are working as hired labourers, engaging in irrigated farming, practicing of professions learned, rearing of animals, and petty trading. While the importance of the strategies to men's and women's is different, the strategies they adopted appeared to meet their household requirements. Originality/value - The study reveals that local creativities can help in meeting rural farmers' needs during the periods of climate change. Consequently, this research has value for development organisations supporting farmers to effectively use their indigenous knowledge during the periods of climate change.",0.9135366820992489,0.2719280478619945,0.04493985059151816,0.6576546185252952,0.03220585397998739,0.028159069685500474,0.06902314604085079
What Drives Farmers to Make Top-Down or Bottom-Up Adaptation to Climate Change and Fluctuations? A Comparative Study on 3 Cases of Apple Farming in Japan and South Africa,"Agriculture is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change. Farmers have been exposed to multiple stressors including climate change, and they have managed to adapt to those risks. The adaptation actions undertaken by farmers and their decision making are, however, only poorly understood. By studying adaptation practices undertaken by apple farmers in three regions: Nagano and Kazuno in Japan and Elgin in South Africa, we categorize the adaptation actions into two types: farmer initiated bottom-up adaptation and institution led top-down adaptation. We found that the driver which differentiates the type of adaptation likely adopted was strongly related to the farmers' characteristics, particularly their dependence on the institutions, e.g. the farmers' cooperative, in selling their products. The farmers who rely on the farmers' cooperative for their sales are likely to adopt the institution-led adaptation, whereas the farmers who have established their own sales channels tend to start innovative actions by bottom-up. We further argue that even though the two types have contrasting features, the combinations of the both types of adaptations could lead to more successful adaptation particularly in agriculture. This study also emphasizes that more farm-level studies for various crops and regions are warranted to provide substantial feedbacks to adaptation policy.",0.9396712542589001,0.21127826622193036,0.08774681299829548,0.43487647983121763,0.042406299714935064,0.03008888748249217,0.011949965140764724

Agricultural adaptation to climate change: observations from the Mid-Hills of Nepal,"This paper provides empirical evidence of agricultural adaptation strategies being adopted in the Mid-Hills regions of Nepal in response to climate change. Farmers were interviewed across four districts and climate change observations were reported, most notably those of increased temperatures and unpredictable precipitation. Agricultural adaptation strategies adopted in response to climate change were varied, with agroforestry and organic farming being the most popular practices. Most adaptation strategies were thought to be development-facing actions to reduce vulnerability, rather than specifically addressing climate change. From this research it is evident that indigenous knowledge, financial support and increased accessibility all play a pivotal role for successful climate change adaptation in the Mid-Hills.

Adaptation needs of farmers to climate change in an ecologically vulnerable alpine region: Take Gannan Plateau for example,"The impacts of climate change on the people who serving the natural resources as a livelihood is particularly significant. To define the adaptation demands of farmers to climate change is very important to develop effectively adaptation policies for climate change, and to enhance the farmers’ adaptability to climate change. This paper, based on 500 questionnaires, analysis of the adaptation demands of the different regions and different livelihood strategies of farmers in Gannan plateau, and the key factors of affecting the adaptation demands of the farmers by using the two logistic regression model. The results show that:(1) In the process of adaptation to climate change, the infrastructure demands of farmers in Gannan plateau is the most intense, and secondly are both of the demands of information and production technology. (2) There are different demands in adaptation to climate change in different regions, of which, both of the demands of the farmers of pastoral area and farming district for infrastructure are the strongest, and the demands of agricultural-pastoral area for information is the most intense. (3) Different livelihood strategies of farmers to climate change have different demands, of which, the demands of type I households(with less than 10% of their income from non-farm) for credit insurance is the most intense, the demands of type II households (with 10% to 50% of their income from non-farm) and type III (with more than 50% of their income from non-farm) households for infrastructure are the most strong; (4) In addition, the natural capital and the physical capital are the key factors that affect farmers’ demands for the production technology, the natural capital and the human capital are the key factors that influence farmers’ demands for information, the human capital and the financial capital are the key factors that impact farmers’ demands for infrastructure, and the natural capital, human capital, financial capital, material capital and the social capital are the key factors that affecting farmers’ demands for credit insurance. Finally, the policy suggestions to improve the farmers’ adaptation to climate change are proposed. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

Factors affecting the adoption of multiple climate-smart agricultural practices in the Indo-Gangetic Plains of India,"Climate change poses a major threat to agricultural production and food security in India, and climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is crucial in addressing the potential impacts. Using survey data from 1,267 farm households in 25 villages from Bihar and Haryana in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, this study analyzes the factors that determine the probability and level of adoption of multiple CSA practices, including seeds of stress-tolerant varieties, minimum tillage, laser land leveling, site-specific nutrient management and crop diversification. We applied a multivariate probit model for the simultaneous multiple adoption decisions, and ordered probit models for assessing the factors affecting the level of adoption. The adoption of the various CSA practices is interrelated, whereas several factors, including household characteristics, plot characteristics, market access and major climate risks are found to affect the probability and level of CSA adoption. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) adoption and its intensity also vary significantly between eastern Bihar, which is relatively poor and densely populated, and north-western Haryana. Engaging multiple stakeholders such as farmers, agricultural institutions, agricultural service providers and concerned government departments at the local level is crucial for the large-scale uptake of CSA. The study, therefore, calls for agricultural policy reforms so that most of the issues related to the uptake of CSA can be adequately addressed.",0.9494955034418028,0.15564579118989635,0.07896783901626497,0.6349963680145978,0.02062206980563055,0.02377487930703744,0.04062029021062319
Impact of farm households' adaptations to climate change on food security: Evidence from different agro-ecologies of Pakistan,"The study used data from 3298 food crop growers in Pakistan. Potential outcome treatment effects model was applied to evaluate the impact of adaptations on household food security. A household Food Security Index (FSI) was constructed applying Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Adaptation strategies employed by the farmers in response to climate change were categorised into four groups namely: changes in sowing time (C1); input intensification (C2); water and soil conservation (C3); and changes in varieties (C4). Out of 15 mutually exclusive combinations constructed for evaluation, only 7 combinations were considered for estimating the treatment effects models because of limited number of observations in other cases. Results of only two of the 7 are discussed in the paper, as the other 5 had very small number of adapters and the impact measures shown either insignificant results or had opposite signs. The first (C1234) combined all the four, while the second (C234) combined the last three strategies. The results suggest that the households which adapted to climate changes were statistically significantly more food secure as compared to those who did not adapt. The results further show that education of the male and female heads, livestock ownership, the structure of house-both bricked and having electricity facility, crops diversification, and non-farm income are among the factors, which raise the food security of farm households and their impacts are statistically significant. The variables which are significantly negatively associated with the food security levels include age of the head of household, food expenditure management, households having less than 12.5 acres of land-defined as marginal (cultivate <6.25 acres) and small (cultivate >6.25 to <12.5 acres). Farmers of cotton-wheat, rice-wheat, and rain-fed cropping systems are found to be more food secure as compared to the farmers working in the mixed cropping systems where farm holdings are relatively small and high use of tube-well water adding to salinity of soils. It is crucial to invest in the development of agricultural technological packages, addressing issues of climate change relevant to different ecologies and farming systems; improve research-extension-farmer linkages; enhance farmers' access to new technologies; improve rural infrastructure; development of weather information system linking meteorological department, extension and farmers; and establishment of targeted food safety nets as well as farm subsidy programs for marginal farm households. © The Pakistan Development Review.",0.9913830314289971,0.13300319588460885,0.07633647841383552,0.6679678442859629,0.008906976757714043,0.008104006171915413,0.021301953735598338
"Improving crop production for food security and improved livelihoods on the East India Plateau II. Crop options, alternative cropping systems and capacity building","Rainfed transplanted rice (Oryza sativa) is the staple crop of the East India Plateau, with >80% grown in a rice-fallow on terraced and bunded hill-slopes ('medium-upland') where it is low yielding and drought-prone despite high rainfall (>1200 mm). Paper I attributed this to inadequate ponding for transplanted rice whilst identifying the potential for risk-free alternative kharif (monsoon period) crops, including direct-seeded rice grown without ponding ('aerobic' rice), and for second-cropping with little or no irrigation. Paper II reports research with Tribal smallholders in Purulia District, West Bengal that aimed to evaluate these cropping options using a participatory process that further aimed to 'improve the situation' of participating families. The feasibility of short-duration aerobic rice was confirmed experimentally in 2007 and 2008 and in wider adoption by farmers in 2010 when conventional rice could not be transplanted. Best yields in each year were >4 t ha(-1). Mustard (Brassica juncea) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) planted after medium-duration rice yielded up to 0.95 t ha(-1) and 2.6 t ha(-1) with one irrigation of 40-50 mm for establishment; but modelling suggests there is enough residual soil water after short-duration (early-maturing) rice to exceed these yields in most years, even without irrigation. Significant P-fertiliser was required with these crops to correct acute deficiency. Rainfed vegetables were grown in the kharif and then adapted by farmers to pre-kharif cropping, and to the rabi (winter) if they had some access to irrigation. Monitoring land-use revealed rapid, sustained adoption of more diverse and intensive cropping, with significant social and economic benefits. We attributed adoption to the participatory process used, that strengthened farmer's capacity to innovate. The systems implemented by farmers needed no expenditure on new water resources, suggesting that comprehensive watershed development (WSD) is not a prerequisite to replacing the rigid rice-fallow with safer climate-responsive systems, although investment in small water harvesting structures may be needed for rabi vegetable crops. The technology evaluated, plus the process of intervention that built capacity, together provide a foundation for wider adoption of less risky cropping systems with greater water productivity.

"Regional path dependence and climate change adaptation: A case study from the McLaren Vale, South Australia","The adaptation of agricultural systems to climate change remains one of humanity's greatest challenges. Regions with complex, knowledge-intensive farming practices have many components that can be adjusted to increase systemic resilience. An argument for the importance of evolutionary adaptation pathways is developed with a case-study of the viticultural region of the McLaren Vale in South Australia. In a series of walk-and-talk interviews, farmers describe their business risks and the opportunities to adapt. Their responses suggest a sophisticated ecological understanding facilitated by their life-experiences, learning networks and relationships with governance, research and marketing organisations. In particular, a new exploitation of agrobiodiversity is generating on-farm resilience by spreading the risks of production and providing opportunities for the region to better respond to changing environmental and market conditions. Individual farmers have developed unique climate change adaptation pathways, but effective cooperation has also enabled the evolution of a regional adaptation cluster. Regions such as the McLaren Vale with a path dependence of innovation could have a cultural heritage that supports attempts at adaptation, which will in turn make them vital first-movers in the search for effective responses to climate change risk.",0.693621103631395,0.34522772258878576,0.1170408008593698,0.37723492965234656,0.06186283465333113,0.043477891354013955,0.04443345329675391
"Farmers' Perception on the Sustainability of as a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy in Agusan Agusan Del Sur and North Cotobato, Philippines","This documentation research sought to evaluate the effectiveness of rubberbased agroforestry typologies as a climate change adaptation strategy in the major rubber producing regions in the Philippines, particularly in Agusan del Sur and North Cotabato. It focused on the understanding/perception of the RBAS farmer respondents on climate change and their account of its influence on the production system and their coping mechanisms. Among the farmer respondents, drought (El Nino), typhoon, strong winds, heavy rains/excessive rainfall, flash floods and landslides are among the common evidences of climate change. Generally, most of the adaptation strategies employed is through cultural management practices like minimized usage of inorganic fertilizer and chemical pesticides from Agusan del Sur farmer respondents while some of the farmer respondents in North Cotabato employed organic farming practices to adapt to climate change. For both provinces, farmer respondents particularly identified agroforestry and diversified farming system as an effective adaptation strategy. Results proved the potential of the rubber-based agroforestry system to evolve as a resilient farming practice to adapt to climate change vis-a-vis stable biological and economic productivity, controlled occurrence of pest and diseases and minimized detrimental effects of climate change on the agroforestry farm component as a whole.",0.9310230340140397,0.22316821719962002,0.11413044437393031,0.4398967596741606,0.022046374014861307,0.018051170290864064,0.06186653598948336
Vulnerability and Adaptation of Livestock Producers to Climate Variability and Change,"Rangeland-based animal husbandry has been frequently exposed to the vagaries of weather. While the current rates of climate variability are unprecedented in arid and semiarid regions, climate change is expected to put further pressure on rangelands with medium- and poor-quality forages and increase the vulnerability of households who mainly depend on livestock production. Therefore, it is imperative to ensure that livestock producers increase their resilience to climate variability or change. However, few field-based studies have focused on simultaneous investigation of both vulnerability and adaptation of livestock keepers to climate-related risks. To fill this gap, a field-based research study was conducted in southwest Iran. A survey of 274 herder families, selected using a cluster sampling technique, revealed low, medium and high levels of vulnerability, which were principally distinguished by various degrees of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Further, this study identified the main adaptation strategies employed by the herders of this region (i.e., purchasing fodder; rotational grazing; raising a mixed-herd, on-farm occupation; and postharvest grazing). Results indicated that most herder families applied traditional adaptation strategies in response to climate variability. Findings revealed that herders had to reduce their livestock due to low adaptability. Loan term, purchasing insurance, level of exposure, income, experience, response efficacy, and knowledge were the major determinants of the herders' adaptation decisions. To increase the resilience of livestock producers against climate change, restructuring traditional livestock production systems, producing participatory knowledge and information for sustainable management of rangelands, and designing or redesigning effective adaptation strategies are required.

Supplemental irrigation water rights and climate change adaptation,"Adaptation to water scarcity induced by future climate change will be crucial for the viability of agricultural economies in many areas of the world. In this paper, we study the acquisition of supplemental irrigation water rights as an adaptation strategy undertaken by irrigation-dependent farmers in response to historical climate change. By exploiting the panel structure of a unique dataset of farm-level supplemental right adoption decisions in the state of Oregon, we establish a relationship between climate conditions, competition for local water resources, and the acquisition of supplemental rights. Our results indicate that a warmer, drier climate increases the likelihood that irrigated farms acquire supplemental rights, suggesting that farmers in Oregon have used supplemental rights to adapt to historical climate change. We also find evidence of heterogeneous effects suggesting that junior irrigators, groundwater-dependent irrigators, and farmers with access to a relatively lower volume of water have been most affected by historical climate change with respect to their supplemental water right acquisition decisions.",0.7962776973963457,0.20172749705693419,0.13352545091732265,0.33897869290890204,0.03902898205355595,0.0438345926958885,0.5
"Farmers' Adaptation to Climate Change, Its Determinants and Impacts on Rice Yield in Nepal","This paper explores the factors that influence farmers' decision-making in adopting climate change adaptation strategies and how these adaptations impact on farm yields. We employ a simultaneous equations model to investigate the differential effects of adaptation on adapters and non-adapters. An endogenous switching mechanism is employed to account for selectivity bias. Based on a survey of 422 rice farmers in Nepal, our results show that farmers' education, access to credit and extension services, experience with climate change impacts such as drought and flood, information on climate change issues, belief in climate change and the need to adapt all variously determine their decision-making. We find that the adaptation strategies employed by farmers significantly increase rice yields. Furthermore, results indicate that both adapters and non-adapters would benefit from the adaptation of the identified strategies. This study, therefore, provides supportive evidence for policy makers to take into consideration farmers' existing knowledge and skills in adapting to climate change. The findings show that it is imperative to involve fanners in climate change adaptation planning processes if the full benefits of such policy action are to be realized.",0.9314409934489749,0.22696151293086556,0.07426465066006618,0.43565625857797874,0.045542053166823235,0.02852878352712668,0.06051478275632625
The risk of second-best adaptive measures: Farmers facing drought in Thailand,"The measures taken by farmers to adapt to climate events are generally characterized in terms of the required resources and their effects, and based on these effects, measures are typified as leading to short-term or long-term adaptation, or to maladaptation. This paper examines the short-term effects of adaptive measures taken by farmers in Suphanburi Province, Thailand, to deal with the major hydrological drought in 2015 and 2016. The farmers implemented diverse measures aimed at increasing access to water, reducing their need for irrigation water or obtaining a non-agricultural income. Less than one third of interviewed farmers were able to implement first-best adaptive measures, which involved little risk as farmers had secure access to alternative sources of water and to markets. The other farmers were unable to implement these measures. Half of the farmers opted for second-best measures, which involved risky attempts to increase access to water or to shift to other productions. Farmers also took other second-best adaptive measures that involved much less risk, such as non-agricultural activities, but that only provided a limited income. Therefore, based on their short-term effects, most adaptive actions could not be typified in terms of increasing or decreasing farmers' vulnerability to drought, but far better in terms of the risks they involved.",0.9482567084115697,0.1832056919448441,0.10392316743016246,0.36544350926867636,0.02630152653100151,0.029429152315270452,0.2927938974761158
Livelihoods on the Edge without a Safety Net: The Case of Smallholder Crop Farming in North-Central Namibia,"Semi-arid Namibia is marginal for agricultural production. Low soil fertility combined with low and variable rainfall restrict the livelihoods of smallholder farmers who often struggle to produce enough food. Although historically, communities have adopted a number of coping mechanisms, climate change threatens to further reduce agricultural production. There are many additional options available to smallholder farmers to adapt to climate change, but they are not necessarily adopting these measures despite having noticed increasing temperatures and declining rainfall. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in three villages in Onesi constituency to examine what agricultural practices smallholder crop farmers use, perception of changes in their yields, their perspective on future yields and whether they are planning on changing their agricultural practices. The results suggest that to sustain the livelihoods of rural communities in north-central Namibia, support is needed from local and regional authorities, as well as traditional and religious leaders to assist with enhancing access to information, enabling information sharing on adaptation options, and increasing awareness on climate change, its impacts and what can be done about it. In addition to this, implementation of the adaptation action also requires demonstration sites and building capacity to enable the development of self-help groups.",0.9491930530558261,0.19086512852582307,0.06117433923872486,0.5830509111489619,0.03160991260548082,0.023366193459945683,0.02414085027841495
Smallholder farmers managing climate risk in India: 1. Adapting to a variable climate,"This paper describes an investigation of various adaptations of rice based cropping systems to climate variability in India's Telangana State. All adaptations were generated through participatory engagement and were field-tested with local smallholder households before being evaluated through cropping system simulation analysis. This approach contrasts with most research about adaptation of cropping systems to climate variability and climate change that is mostly based on simplifying assumptions about current farmer management practices and where the feasibility of implementing proposed adaptations is rarely tested. In this study, the investigation commenced with discussions about climate related issues in rice based farming systems between researchers, farmers and NGOs in three villages in three Mandals of the state of Telangana. Participatory intervention was used to identify new practices that could provide more adaptive and robust responses to climate variability. Suggested adaptations were implemented in on-farm experimentation. Fields demonstrating these adaptations were monitored and results were discussed with participating farmers at regular 'Climate Club' village meetings. Crop and soil data from these fields were used to locally parameterise the cropping systems simulator APSIM. Local adaptations that were trialled in the villages were simulated using local soil and long term historical weather data. In each of the case studies, a number of adaptations that were developed and implemented in the villages were shown through simulation to be successful in terms of agricultural production, stability of yields and resource use efficiency. Of the adaptations investigated, sowing rules to reduce the chance of crop failure due to early dry spells were most readily adopted and are also relatively easy to extend to other villages. Strategic irrigation of rainfed crops such as maize and cotton resulted in significant gains to profitability and stability of these crops but cannot be considered in isolation where access to water is limited. Reduced irrigation of rice resulted in over 60 mm/ha/yr. savings in water and some improvements in gross margins but this adaptation was not popular with farmers due to its burden on labour and added risks associated with unreliable supply of electricity for pumping at critical times. The reduced rice area for strategic irrigation of rainfed crops adaptation resulted in improved gross margins per hectare per year and higher net water productivity. This adaptation is most promising but will require institutional change around water use policy and more equitable allocation of limited water resources within villages. These results led us to the proposition that participatory action research with smallholder farmers, coupled with field-testing and simulation analysis can produce practical and productive adaptations to climate variability.

Impacts and responses to environmental change in coastal livelihoods of south-west Bangladesh,"Aquatic ecosystems are of global importance for maintaining high levels of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and for the number of livelihoods dependent on them. In Bangladesh, coastal and delta communities rely on these systems for a livelihood, and the sustainability of the productivity is seriously threatened by both climate change and unsustainable management. These multiple drivers of change shape the livelihood dependence and adaptation responses, where a better understanding is needed to achieve sustainable management in these systems, while maintaining and improving dependent livelihoods. This need has been addressed in this study in the region of Satkhira, in the southwest coast of Bangladesh, where livelihoods are highly dependent on aquatic systems for food supply and income. Traditional wild fish harvest in the rivers and aquaculture systems, including ghers, ponds, and crab points have been changing in terms of the uses and intensity of management, and suffering from climate change impacts as well. By means of six focus groups with 50 participants total, and validated by expert consultations, we conduct an analysis to understand the main perceived impacts from climate and human activities; and the adaptation responses from the aquatic system livelihoods. We find that biodiversity has decreased drastically, while farmed species have increased and shrimp gher farming turned more intensive becoming the main source of income. All these changes have important implications for food supply in the region and environmental sustainability. Dramatic responses taken in the communities include exit the fisheries and migration, and more adaptive responses include species diversification, crab fattening and working more on the pond and gher infrastructure. This study evidences the results of the combination of multiple stressors in productive systems and the barriers to adaptation in aquatic ecosystem dependent communities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

"Climate risk management information, sources and responses in a pastoral region in East Africa","Pastoralists in East Africa face a range of stressors, climate variability and change being one of them. Effective climate risk management involves managing the full range of variability and balancing hazard management with efforts to capitalise on opportunity; climate risk management information is central in this process. In this study, pastoralists' perceptions of climate change, climate risk management information types, sources and attendant responses in a pastoral region in East Africa are examined. Through a multi-stage sampling process, a total of 198 heads of households in three districts were selected and interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. In addition, 29 focus group discussions and 10 key informant interviews were conducted to generate qualitative information to supplement survey data. Descriptive and thematic analysis were utilised in summarizing the data. Ninety-nine percent of the pastoralists noted that the climate had changed evidenced by high but erratic rainfall, occurrence of floods and variation in rainfall onset and cessation among other indicators. This change in climate had led to emergence of 'new' livestock and crop diseases, crop failure and low yields leading to frequent food shortages, water shortages, poor market access, and variation in pasture availability among other effects. Climate risk management information was received from multiple sources including; radio, diviners, community meetings, shrine elders, humanitarian agencies, and Uganda People's defence forces (UPDF). Community meetings were however perceived as most accessible, reliable and dependable sources of information. Shifting livestock to dry season grazing and watering areas, selling firewood and charcoal, seeking for military escorts to grazing areas, purchasing veterinary drugs, shifting livestock to disease 'free' areas, and performing rituals (depending on the perceived risk) constituted a set of responses undertaken in response to perceived climate risk. It is recommended that an integrated early warning system that captures the perceptions and practices of the pastoralists is implemented as this would increase the credibility of climate risk information disseminated.

Costs and benefits of climate-smart agriculture: The case of the Dry Corridor in Guatemala,"Central American countries, particularly Guatemala, are experiencing extreme climate events which are disproportionately affecting agriculture and subsequently rural livelihoods. Governments are taking action to address climatic threats, but they need tools to assess the impact of policies and interventions aiming to decrease the impacts of climate change on agriculture. This research, conducted with national policy makers and climate change and agriculture stakeholders in Guatemala, provides a comparative analysis of eight climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and technologies associated with the smallholder maize-beads production system in the Dry Corridor. The practices were identified as high-interest for investment by national stakeholders. CSA practices and technologies aim to improve food security, resilience, and low emissions development, where possible and appropriate. The paper assesses the cost-benefit profile of the introduction of CSA options into farm production systems. Indicators related to profitability and valuation of environmental and social externalities are used to assess options. Probabilistic cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is used to address field variability and high uncertainty around parameter values. All practices except one were profitable over their lifecycle, with some practices, expected to be ideal for drought prone areas, presenting a higher risk for adoption. The results were discussed with national stakeholders who established best-bet CSA investment portfolios. This paper argues that a thorough understanding of the costs and benefits of potential CSA options is needed to channel investments effectively and efficiently towards both short- and long-term interventions and should be coupled with broader assessment of tradeoffs between CSA outcomes.

Is agricultural adaptation to global change in lower-income countries on track to meet the future food production challenge?,"Agriculture is critical to sustainable development, and agricultural production by smallholders in lower-income countries contributes substantially to the food security of both rural and urban populations. Smallholders face many challenges related to urbanisation, sustainable use of natural resources and climate change. While there will be different ways of achieving sustainable agricultural systems, all will involve adaptation on a massive scale to meet the future food production challenge at greatly reduced carbon cost. Here we evaluate recent progress in agricultural adaptation using surveys in five regions, 21 countries and 45 sites, covering 315 villages and approximately 6300 households. These surveys include information about the changes made to farming systems in the last decade. We synthesise this information by grouping households into types: food insecure, hanging in, stepping up and stepping out. We then profile each site in terms of its proportion of households of these four types. While farmers have made some changes in their farming practices over the last decade, most changes have been incremental and piecemeal. We find little evidence in the study sites in any region of farming changes at the scale needed to enhance food security of significant proportions of the population. Searching for commonalities in the enabling environment among sites with similar proportions of household types, we found collective action at the community level coupled with appropriate climate information provision and the active participation of local organisations to be associated with higher levels of food security. To foster the changes needed in agricultural and food systems, a much stronger focus will be required on the enabling environment if food security goals are to be attainable. Without more nuanced and effective targeting of technological as well as institutional interventions, agricultural adaptation to meet the food production challenge in the coming decades is unlikely to occur.",0.9037321522313119,0.24222675907838154,0.0993526021172199,0.5,0.027335030428973645,0.035085534233019675,0.05068457211351197
The Role of Social Networks in Agricultural Adaptation to Climate Change: Implications for Sustainable Agriculture in Pakistan,"Incorporating adaptation into subsistence farming systems is an important strategy to reduce damages related to climate change and to protect livelihoods in developing countries. Using a dataset of 450 farm households collected from three agro-ecological zones, this study examines rural networks, assesses farm-level institutional support and documents any existing structural gaps on climate change adaptation in the agricultural sector of Pakistan. For this purpose, a social network analysis method is used. The study findings reveal that farmers reported a decrease in crop production and increase in pests and diseases due to climate change. Further, changing crop varieties, sowing dates, input mixes and planting trees are the key measures adopted by farmers. Lack of information, finances and resources are the key adaptation constraints. The study findings show that only 28% and 13% of the respondents do not have access to financial services and climate adaptation knowledge, respectively. Support to farmers mainly consists of marketing information and farm equipment from community-based organizations, while private institutions offer weather forecasting services. Public institutions are poorly represented in the network analysis. We also found that extension services are key institutions in the climate adaptation network, while agricultural credits, post-harvest services and marketing of produce were dominant but weakly connected in the financial support network. We also found that with an increase in the provision of services at the farm level, farmers not only adapt more but also move from low-cost and short-term measures to advanced measures. This study proposes an integrated framework to improve the stakeholders' networking through different kind of partnerships and better adaptation to climate change.",0.9513778409467707,0.20492943297844654,0.0957487528182562,0.47256698925992346,0.018018689714233028,0.025498466508472494,0.026785289412549543

Adaptation of forest management to climate change as perceived by forest owners and managers in Belgium,"Background: Climate change is likely to cause significant modifications in forests. Rising to this challenge may require adaptation of forest management, and therefore should trigger proactive measures by forest managers, but it is unclear to what extent this is already happening. Methods: The survey carried out in this research assesses how forest stakeholders in Belgium perceive the role of their forest management in the context of climate change and the impediments that limit their ability to prepare and respond to these changes. Results: Respondents indicated strong awareness of the changing climate, with more than two-thirds (71 %) expressing concern about the impacts of climate change on their forests. However, less than one-third of the respondents (32 %) reported modifying their management practices motivated by climate change. Among the major constraints limiting their climate related actions, lack of information was considered the most important for managers of both public and private forests. Conclusions: Knowledge transfer is an essential condition for research to lead to innovation. Improving the communication and demonstration of possible solutions for climate change adaptation is therefore likely to be the most effective strategy for increasing their adoption.",0.48733034489932253,0.23238534751504905,0.20434111364973628,0.20700624891288893,0.05118528436559321,0.04092523366406093,0.04029613810364499
Drought Impact and Adaptation Strategies in the Mid-Hill Farming System of Western Nepal,"Climate-induced drought hazard has been emerging as one of the major challenges in the mid-hill farming system and rural livelihood in Nepal. Drought stress, in combination with century-long socio-political issues such as unequal social structure, gender discrimination, and marginalization of poor and disadvantaged groups have made smallholders more vulnerable in society. Climate changes are exacerbating issues within an already vulnerable society. Therefore, a review study on the impact of drought on the rain-fed hill farming system, and the potential adaptation measures, was carried out in the mid-hill region of western Nepal. Both agricultural impacts such as depletion of traditional varieties of crops, crop-specific diseases, low production, lack of water for irrigation; and non-agricultural impacts such as changing rural livelihood patterns, and social conflict due to agriculture and water issues were identified as major impacts. Some of the agricultural adaptation measures viz. the promotion of climate smart agriculture practices, crop diversification, and agroforestry practices seem to have been more effective in the region. At the same time, small-scale structural water harvesting measures, for instance, rainwater harvesting, conservation ponds, and irrigation channels, drip water irrigation, and an early warning system for drought events could also be an advantage in this context. Nonetheless, there are several adaptation barriers including ecological and physical constraints, human and information resource-shortages, and social barriers to adaptation. Therefore, local site-specific adaptation measures should be developed, and implemented, to increase the adaptive capacity of smallholders, and enhance the farming system in the face of the climate-induced drought scenario.",0.9658903495401644,0.22305476054621864,0.1261111147962621,0.4618449262706804,0.028475627129891396,0.029684202725284447,0.4811965282420291
"Socio-economic factors influencing utilisation of rain water harvesting and saving technologies in Tharaka South, Eastern Kenya","Low levels of soil moisture makes rain water harvesting and saving technologies important interventions for water supply and food production in arid and semi-arids lands of Kenya. Despite much research around this theme, factors affecting utilisation of these technologies by farmers have not been well understood and the low adoption and adaptation levels of these beneficial technologies remains a challenge. This paper extends this dimension with emphasis on Tharaka South sub-county where water scarcity, unreliable rainfall and soil water stress is a major cause of household food insecurity. Farm and social data were collected using a cross-sectional survey design targeting a total of 351 household heads. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression. The utilization of in situ rainwater harvesting and saving technologies was higher for trashlines (73%) as compared to micro-catchments, Zai pits (26%) and Negarims (13%). Socio-economic characteristics that were positively and significantly associated with Zai pit utilisation included household size (p<0.01), training in Zai pits (p<0.002), while total farm size (p<0.01) and land tenure (p<0.01) showed negative co-efficients. Both formal and informal sources of training were important tools in disseminating rain-water harvesting and saving technologies. The study concluded that farmer age, household size, farm size, farming history, training, and formal education were important factors which influenced utilisation of rain water harvesting and saving technologies in Tharaka sub-county. Specific approaches are needed to scale-up resource-intensive technologies (Fanya jun. Zai pits, and Negarims) compared to less resource-intensive technologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Assessing farmer use of climate change adaptation practices and impacts on food security and poverty in Pakistan,"Climate change is set to be particularly disruptive in poor agricultural communities. We assess the factors influencing farmers' choice of climate change adaptation practices and associated impacts on household food security and poverty in Pakistan using comprehensive data from 950 farmers from its major provinces. A probit model was used to investigate the factors influencing the use of climate-change adaptation practices; the censored least absolute deviation (CLAD) was used to analyze the determinants of the number of adaptation practices used; and a propensity score matching (PSM) approach was employed to evaluate the impact of adaptation practices on food security and poverty levels. Adjustment in sowing time (22% households), use of drought tolerant varieties (15%) and shifting to new crops (25%) were the three major adaptation practices used by farmers in the study area. Results show that younger farmers and farmers with higher levels of education are more likely to use these adaptation practices, as do farmers that are wealthier, farm more land and have joint families. The number of adaptation practices used was found to be positively associated with education, male household heads, land size, household size, extension services, access to credit and wealth. Farmers adopting more adaptation practices had higher food security levels (8-13%) than those who did not, and experienced lower levels of poverty (3-6%). Climate change adaptation practices at farm level can thereby have significant development outcomes in addition to reducing exposure to weather risks. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Adapting to changing climate through improving adaptive capacity at the local level - The case of smallholder horticultural producers in Ghana,"The consequences of changing climate are often negatively impacting agricultural production, particularly vulnerable smallholder farmers. Smallholder systems heterogeneity requires local specific climate adaptation for reducing the negative impacts of changing climate in regions heavily relying on small farms agriculture. This study examined the trend in climate in Ghana, how smallholder horticultural farmers perceive this changing climate and how they are responding to its perceived effects. A survey of 480 resource-constrained horticultural producers was conducted in two municipalities of Ghana. Descriptive analysis and Weighted Average Index were employed to rank identified adaptation strategies and challenges. The results showed that farmers are already experiencing increasing temperature and declining rainfall patterns consistent with trends of observed climate changing in the last two decades. To reduce vulnerability and improve resilience of smallholders' production activities, a range of farmer driven soil, water and crop conservation measures and farm management practices are being adopted. The most important adaptation practices identified include fertilization, supplementary irrigation, crop rotation, intercropping and mixed farming. Enhancing households' climate adaptive capacity is dependent on factors such as improved access to financial resources, climate and production information, market accessibility, farm equipment, storage facilities and other institutional support. To facilitate effective and successful adaptation at the local level, government and institutional support are recommended to complement households' autonomous strategies for improved decision-making, adaptation plans and actions.",0.962099856180431,0.1560121064377668,0.08198145652502141,0.525915395605309,0.020356313612093817,0.013486414853428604,0.026276097195104313

Why do we not pick the low-hanging fruit? Governing adaptation to climate change and resilience in Tyrolean mountain agriculture,"Impacts of climate change have become more and more evident and can be observed in ecosystems, societies and economies worldwide. Mountain agriculture is especially vulnerable to climate change, and adaptation seems crucial. Thus, certain adaptation activities, such as installing irrigation technology, switching to drought-resistant crop varieties or shifting planting dates, can already be observed. Despite these efforts, the barriers for climate change adaptation are still manifold and lead to adaptation gaps. One problem is that many approaches ignore non-climatic drivers, such as economic conditions or cultural aspects, which have a strong influence on farmers' decisions. In the literature, the focus is mostly on planned, ""top-down"" induced adaptations, where climate change is considered the most important driver. Within this study, we focus on local, ""bottom-up"" adaptation actions in Tyrolean mountain agriculture that may be triggered by climatic as well as by non-climatic drivers. We identify 27 adaptation practices and cluster them into six types of climate change adaptation: 'Resilience-raising products and production', 'Hidden actions by farmer organizations', 'CC motivated agronomic actions', 'CCA scientific knowledge production', 'Risk-driven adaptations' and 'Hidden governmental actions'. These types are helpful to show the broad range of local practices contributing to climate change adaptation. Several adaptation actions from practice are not motivated by climate change and thus are termed ""hidden"" adaptations, as they do not fit into common adaptation concepts. Hidden climate change adaptation practices, although not considered to date in official CCA policy documents, constitute ""low-hanging fruit"" for decision makers as they have already proved their feasibility and gained legitimacy by actors on the ground. We argue that additional support for such hidden adaptation practices can help to overcome present adaptation barriers and adaptation gaps.",0.6447297205447476,0.2698899103367842,0.10013262508514109,0.2924289317131776,0.05580342344342166,0.07586300516971266,0.05051756825023871
"Farm level adaptation practices of potato growing farmers in East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya, India","Aim: This paper attempted to analyse the adaptation practices of potato farmers against the adverse effects of climate change in Meghalaya state of North East India, their level of adaptation and also the constraints to adoption of adaptation practices. Methodology: The ex-post facto research design was selected for the study. The study was conducted in East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya by interviewing 120 potato growers using interview schedule. The level of adaptation of each farmer to climate change was analyzed based on the total score of adaptation of each respondent farmer. The rank of each adaptation practice adopted by respondent farmers was analyzed using Weighted Mean Score. The constraints faced by potato growers to adoption of adaptation practices was identified by asking the respondents and simultaneously recording their responses. Results: The findings revealed that there were twelve major adaptation practices followed by majority of potato growers. It also revealed that majority of the respondents had medium level of adaptation to climate change. The major constraints in adoption of adaptation practices were lack of quality seeds, price fluctuation in the market, low technical knowledge about improved potato cultivation, lack of efficient transport and marketing facilities, non-availability of production inputs and lack of information about weather and climate. Interpretation: The study recommended that the farm level adaptation practices followed by famers need to be properly identified, documented, refined and validated before disseminating and integrating them into packages of practices for adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, these practices and adaptation constraints faced by farmers should be taken into account while developing future climate change strategies.",0.9409985667517679,0.18482863556165868,0.0693458157238986,0.5209090637105253,0.03594266164423257,0.02409889411097439,0.018597994866403664
"Adaptation to climate change in perennial cropping systems: Options, barriers and policy implications","Plantation crops are likely to be highly vulnerable to climate change because of their long economic life span, their typically non-irrigated cropping pattern and the inability to easily switch crops due to high upfront capital costs. Hence the sector requires appropriately designed adaptation options to cope with on-going climate change. Studies on climate adaptation in perennial cropping systems are rare relative to those on annual crops. Based on a cross-sectional survey of 50 tea estate managers representing all tea growing areas in Sri Lanka, this study analyses factors affecting choice of preferred adaptation options, barriers to adaptation and associated policy implications for tea production as an example of a perennial tree crop system. Current adaptation options identified are crop diversification, soil conservation, and shade tree establishment and management. All of these options are adopted in some situations and locations. All estate managers interviewed believe that climate change is happening and almost all are experiencing the negative impacts of climate change on tea production. Results from a multinomial logit analysis show that information on climate change, company size, tea growing elevation, and increases in temperature and rainfall are key factors influencing the preferred choice of adaptation option. Furthermore, results reveal that barriers such as a lack capital, inadequate access to near-term and medium-term climate knowledge, and poor governmental and institutional support may prevent estate managers from experimenting with new adaptation options. Policies should, therefore, be aimed at promoting new adaptation options through information exchange between a wide range of stakeholders, and integrating climate change adaptation with Sri Lanka's sustainable developmental goals. Governmental and institutional support and involvement would be instrumental in facilitating adoption of adaptation options such as Joint-production of tea with valuable timber crops.",0.8270298185332111,0.2334567458250759,0.11568049849273492,0.3998784207273423,0.04753122811161845,0.04975156655035871,0.02899924989374706
Climate variability/change and attitude to adaptation technologies: a pilot study among selected rural farmers' communities in Nigeria,"Understanding climate variability and change is essential for designing adaptation policies and strategies to deal with the impacts of climate change on the agricultural sector. This Paper aims at assessing climate variability/change, the perception of rural farmers on climate change and preferred adaptation strategies among the farmers in some selected farming communities in Nigeria. The study thus used both meteorology data and social survey, to examine variability/change in climate and factors determining the adaptation techniques adopts by rural farmers. The results show a relatively uniform temperatures and some seasonal variations in recent years (diurnal range of temperature is about 10 A degrees C) but the rainfall shows much more seasonal variations. The rainfall has relatively undeviating trend from 1981 to 1996 but the trend appears to be upwards from the year 1997 to 2010. About 72.8% participants responded in the affirmative that climate is changing but there appears to be a significant relationship between the length of farming experiences and farmers' perceptions of climate change adaptation techniques. Water-related (about 53%) and nutrient related (about 52%) technologies appear to have a high preference among the farmers. The major driver that determines farmers' preference for climate change adaptation techniques is their incomes and experiences.",0.9646778099297756,0.20946140564155172,0.06903253899508707,0.5136960396399884,0.03659326647110247,0.01182538220899633,0.05895363923050916
"Determinants of smallholder farmers' adaptation strategies to climate change in the semi arid Nguru Local Government Area, Northeastern Nigeria","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors determining smallholder farmers' adaptation strategies to climate change, in the semi-arid region of Nguru, Nigeria and toward sustainable management of their agricultural production and livelihood. Design/methodology/approach: Both primary and secondary data were used. Primary data were collected by use of structured questionnaires, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Based on the research plan, a total of 250 individual households were randomly selected and interviewed. Findings: The stepwise multiple linear regression model ran using SPSS revealed nine variables significantly determining the adaptation of climate change strategies. The variables found significant were: agricultural labor force, level of education of the household head, land tenure arrangements, gender of the household head, extension service availability, out-migration of labor, years of farming experience, household size and availability of farmer to farmer extension. The predicted R value of 0.87, R2 of 0.63, and adjusted R2 of 0.60 indicate high explanatory power of the model as a whole. Originality/value: The acceptance of the variables included in the model helps very useful policy conclusions for climate change adaptations to be drawn. All these variables, except gender and out-migration, have a positive influence on climate change adaptation strategies. The influence of agricultural labor force appeared to be strongest, indicating the very important role of this factor in adaptation and the need for promotion of less labour-intensive, but more remunerative adaptation strategies that would enable smallholder farmers to manage all of their farm plots in an effective way. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0.9310955517676969,0.19574475863933982,0.07562752369395617,0.645928010787315,0.04037239717236096,0.022063897280990636,0.02333990582239901
"Adoption and impact of rain water harvesting technology on rural livelihoods: The case of Makwanpur district, Nepal","Rain water harvesting (RWH) technology was introduced in Nepal as a climate change adaptation mechanism for sustainable crop production. Using data from 120 farmers (60 RWH technology adopters and 60 non-adopters) in Makwanpur district, the study employed a probit model to identify factors that influenced the adoption decision of RWH technology. The impact of RWH technology on farm income was then determined by a multiple regression model. The results showed that years of schooling, total physical assets and organizational membership of household members were the major determinants of the adoption of RWH technology. The results also showed that the adoption of RWH technology, gender of household head, total household members engaged in agriculture occupation, and total educated household members contributed significantly to annual farm income. Considering weather uncertainties faced by farmers in rainfed areas, RWH technology would be a potential option to improve the rural livelihoods.

Maladaptation in Nordic agriculture,"Climatic changes are expected to pose challenges to Nordic agriculture. While some changes may provide opportunities for higher productivity, others may severely increase agricultural vulnerability. Farmers attempt to adapt or cope with these changes by taking measures to decrease vulnerability or to take advantage of potential benefits, but little is known what outcomes these adaptation measures might have. This study identifies unintended negative impacts of adaptation measures, drawing on a literature review and interviews with farmers and agricultural officials and experts in Sweden and Finland. Based on the conceptual framework of maladaptation, this study identifies outcomes that either increase the vulnerability of the implementing actor, shift the vulnerability to other actors or sectors or affect common pool resources. While a large number of adaptation measures rebound vulnerability to the implementing actor, several potential maladaptive outcomes may shift vulnerability or affect common pool resources. The findings point to the large number of trade-offs that are involved in adaptation decision-making and lead to the conclusion that raising awareness of these aspects can support future adaptation strategies.",0.6587353498069333,0.3032777114103127,0.12688546237617399,0.3354054077357056,0.10418953709625531,0.1053282983211879,0.046125889594232784
Sustainable Land Management Practices Used by Farm Households for Climate Change Adaptation in South East Nigeria,"The study determined the sustainable land management (SLM) practices used by farm households for climate change adaptation in South East Nigeria. Four hundred farm households selected through a multistage random sampling procedure from Enugu and Ebonyi States of Southeast Nigeria were interviewed for the study. Probit model was employed in estimating the determinants of SLM. Findings revealed that the predominant SLM practice is mulching/surface cover and the likelihood of use of mulching significantly increases with number of years the household head spent in school by 6 percent, and increased access to climate change information increased use by 27 percent. The study recommends that the government and civil society should provide information on climate change to the farm households through extension agents, enhance farm household's knowledge on climate change and provide incentives to enhance their income to facilitate the use of SLM by farm households in climate change adaptation.",0.8948413142716303,0.24582272879077524,0.061293743713483055,0.6448913805494766,0.04714076418594284,0.017890822262367552,0.019707450146010507
Economic Analysis of Climate Change Best Management Practices in Vermont Agriculture,"Climate change impacts local agricultural systems in detectable and distinguishable ways from large-scale shifts in water, land, and weather patterns to regionally specific distributions of weeds, pests, and diseases. Best management practices for adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change include modifications to farm production through adjusted intensity and product types and changing land use through crop siting and tillage practices. Farmer perceptions of risk and profitability of best management practices are key determinants of adoption, which traditional incentive programs like the Environmental Quality Incentive Program attempt to address by providing financial and technical support. To ensure that payments offered through these programs that maximize adoption, regional incentive payments must be based upon locally established costs. This paper focuses on the cost of implementing and maintaining climate change specific best management practices (CCBMPs) for twelve diverse farms in Vermont. Specifically, three CCBMPs for Vermont are examined: cover cropping, management intensive rotational grazing (MIRG), and riparian buffer strips. Results show the average cost for cover cropping is $129.24/acre, MIRG is $79.82/acre, and a tree based riparian buffer strip cost $807.33/acre. We conclude that existing incentive payments for cover cropping and MIRG are below costs, likely resulting in under-adoption.",0.8251226047354531,0.2394614239522621,0.17314189829907384,0.36699868573582783,0.033558952950747845,0.050654747009651474,0.06930047024875219
"Impacts, Perceptions and Management of Climate-Related Risks to Cage Aquaculture in the Reservoirs of Northern Thailand","Weather is suspected to influence fish growth and survival, and be a factor in mass mortality events in cage aquaculture in reservoirs. The purpose of this study was to identify the important climate-related risks faced by cage aquaculture farms; evaluate how these risks were currently being managed; and explore how farmers might adapt to the effects of climate change. Fish farmers were interviewed across the northern region of Thailand to get information on impacts, perceptions and practices. Drought or low water levels, heat waves, cold spells and periods with dense cloud cover, each caused significant financial losses. Perceptions of climate-related risks were consistent with experienced impacts. Risks are primarily managed in the short-term with techniques like aeration and reducing feed. In the mid-term farmers adjust stocking calendars, take financial measures and seek new information. Farmers also emphasize the importance of maintaining good relations with other stakeholders and reservoir management. Larger farms placed greater importance on risk management than small farms, even though types and levels of risk perceived were very similar. Most fish farms were managed by men alone, or men and women working together. Gender differences in risk perception were not detected, but women judged a few risk management practices as more important than men. Fish farmers perceived that climate is changing, but their perceptions were not strongly associated with recently having suffered impacts from extreme weather. The findings of this study provide important inputs to improving risk management under current and future climate.",0.9227837080360395,0.2417811608297746,0.11289351091475819,0.270181410186628,0.030113916610911767,0.03183141182384359,0.06702658349269032

Specifically, it analyzes the role of farmer groups in livelihood adaptation of smallholder maize producers in southern Mexico. We show how neoliberal market changes have shaped the local social structure with constraining and enabling effects on households' ability to adapt, while in turn the outcomes of the neoliberal policy reforms are being (re)shaped by the responses of the farmers, thereby changing the structural context.

This study was undertaken to understand the dryland farmers' perceptions about climate change, its impacts and indigenous adaptation measures they pursue. From the analysis of data collected from 200 dryland farmers of Villupuram and Virudhunagar districts in Tamil Nadu, it was found that 81 % of farmers experienced climate change in terms of decreasing and unpredictable rainfall, increasing temperature and delayed onset of monsoon. Analysis of climate trend validated their perceptions. Farmers are convinced that climate change has affected their farming through frequent crop failures, declining crop and livestock yield, reduced water level in tanks and wells and new pest and diseases. Amidst various constraints, farmers strive to adapt to climate change by manipulating sowing date, reducing fertilizer application, selecting alternate crops and drought tolerant varieties, etc. Elderly farmers adapt more to climate change while access to irrigation gives leverage to try alternate farming practices.",0.9889604097859875,0.1117202143446073,0.05853718714246559,0.4182472454098669,0.01330649280737711,0.010078964882547484,0.03494218706280659
"Farmers' risk preferences and their climate change adaptation strategies in the Yongqiao District, China","Farmers' risk preferences play an important role in agricultural production decisions. This study characterizes risk preferences among farmers in Yongqiao and determines how these risk preferences are related to their choices regarding climate change adaptation strategies. We find that most farmers in the study area were aware of climate change. They were taking measures to protect their livelihoods against perceived changes to the local climate. The risk experiment result shows that the representative subject was risk averse, and women were more risk averse than men. The relationships between farmers' risk preferences and different climate change adaptation choices were different. Farmers' risk aversion was negatively and significantly related with adaptation strategies on planting new crop varieties and adopting new technology, but it had a significantly positive effect on purchasing weather index crop insurance. The results also indicate that the level of education, farming experience, farm size, household income and perception of climate change impacts influence farmers' adaptation decisions.

The adoption and impact of engineering-type measures to address climate change: evidence from the major grain-producing areas in China,"Employing an endogenous switching regression model, we investigate the drivers underlying the adaptations made by farm households and their impacts on crop net incomes for adopters and nonadopters, based on a large panel survey data set across the major grain-producing provinces in China. The results show that: (i) access to public climate information and technical or physical support increases the likelihood that farmers adapt to climate change by undertaking irrigation and/or drainage measures; and (ii) decisions to adapt increased crop yield, but they did not significantly increase crop profit margins. This point appears to have been ignored by previous studies. Based on these new empirical results, the paper suggests that government should continue to provide climate information and various types of supports to improve farmers' adaptation abilities and help to reduce the levels of factor input by, for example, substituting organic for chemical fertiliser inputs. Such government-led policies should be supported alongside the implementation of domestic agricultural supply-side reform.",0.9200034399765139,0.22245851736195602,0.06328584329290315,0.41938197107356673,0.03822559136886295,0.045260890832026224,0.06473260563619929
"Indigenous Climate Change Adaptation Strategies Used by Honey Producers in Rural Commimities of Enugu State, Nigeria","The study examined the effectiveness and challenges in the use of indigenous climate change adaptation measures by bee farmers in Enugu State. Sixty households' heads involved in honey production were used. Structured interview schedule, focus group discussion and observation were used for data collection and the analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics. Production of honey across the years (2000 to 2015) showed a downward trend, while the number of hives installed increased significantly. The respondents effectively adapted to climate change through change of sites of hives ((x) over bar= 4.00), tree planting ((x) over bar= 3.33), amendment of the periods of beekeeping operations ((x) over bar= 3.00) among others. However, they experienced challenges caused by indiscriminate cutting of trees ((x) over bar =3.42), inadequate information on adaptation measures ((x) over bar= 3.30), pesticide threat ((x) over bar =3.07) among others. Extension workers should intensify tailored training and visit to beekeepers to update producers' knowledge on bee farming (modern techniques), climate change implications of some farm practices (indiscriminate cutting of tree) and provide information on innovative adaptation options. Educational outreach on climate change to rural communities to stimulate community involvement in promoting environmentally sound practices should be advocated and funded by development agencies. Also, linking farmers to relevant actors, equipment dealers, financial institution; and enacting policy that will create and foster collaborative interaction for effective adaptation to climate change should be championed by public and non - governmental organizations.",0.903464598008009,0.21845716934866174,0.12173725110488497,0.45660763596097054,0.04668053882097083,0.029607009212241995,0.04398886296940711
Local perceptions of and adaptation to climate variability and change: the case of shrimp farming communities in the coastal region of Bangladesh,"Shrimp aquaculture is the predominant farming practice in the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh and has been under increased pressure from environmental and climatic changes. To date, most of the studies examining farmer's vulnerability and adaption to climate change have been agriculture-focused with little attention to the impacts on other livelihood systems. Based on a case study approach our study presents: i) how local people perceive climate change and whether it corresponds to meteorological records, ii) what climate change impacts people consider significant, and iii) what strategies the shrimp farmers employ to ameliorate perceived risks. This study was conducted using local climate data, focus groups and household survey in Mongla sub-district. This study shows that local people are aware of the changes in hydro-climatic parameters. Their accounts of climate change mostly diverge from the scientific evidence when long-term climate trends are considered, but on short-term variability, the correlation between scientific evidence and local perceptions is high. Repeated adverse impacts caused by climate stressors on livelihood activities shape people's climate risk perceptions. In relation to perceived risks, farmers have made adjustments in their aquaculture practices. Yet, the level of responses clearly lags behind the extent to which concerns about climate disturbances are expressed. This is partly due to farmers' efforts for managing transformation from agricultural livelihood system to aquaculture-based livelihood systems and partly associated with other social factors. This case study recommends governmental support for the shrimp aquaculture sector to facilitate the process of adaptation to changes in the hydro-climatic environment.",0.8809589397761374,0.30507762989786147,0.13877640550102877,0.45984086401595575,0.08535151292600217,0.03375914622070503,0.05862104396363537
Socio-Economic Determinants of Cocoyam Farmer's Strategies for Climate Change Adaptation in Southeast Nigeria,"The study assessed cocoyam farmers' strategies for climate change adaptation in Southeast Nigeria. Multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 384 respondents for the study. Data were collected using structured questionnaire and interview schedule and analysed using mean, frequency count, percentages and multinomial logit regression analysis. Findings showed that respondents were mainly women (67%), married (92%) and between the ages of 41 and 60 (52%) with a mean household size of six ( 6) persons. Mean number of years spent in school was 10 years. The majority (40%) earned monthly income of. 20,000 and below. The average farming experience was 21 years with mixed cropping (71%) as the major cropping system while combination of livestock and crop production (48%) was the major farming activity done. Farm size was mainly one hectare and below (64%) which was accessed mainly through inheritance (76%) and farm labour sourced through hired labour (50%). Major crops cultivated was cassava followed by maize and yam. Major adaptation strategies used by the cocoyam farmers in the study area included increased use of organic manure (42%), frequent weeding (10%), application of indigenous knowledge (20%), use of information from extension agents (16%), use of fallowing (9%) and application of multiple cropping (3%). Choice of adaptation strategies used by cocoyam farmers was influenced by age, gender, location of farmer, monthly income and labour. Based on the result of the study, it was recommended that sex and location specific adaptation strategies that are within the financial status of the farmers should be emphasized.",0.9803555967331987,0.17324493261762894,0.07991593749237409,0.6319453883023745,0.024033559464928148,0.011792616056372851,0.005743524984285181
Gender perspectives on agricultural adaptation to climate change in drought-prone Nguru Local Government Area in the semiarid zone of northeastern Nigeria,"Purpose - This paper aims at understanding how smallholder farmers are adapting to drought and what shapes their vulnerabilities and ability to adapt. Considering that their capacity to adapt to climate change has been undermined not only by the natural vulnerabilities due to their geographic location but also by the social context, gender and institution that interact to influence and determine household and individual vulnerability and responses to drought. Design/methodology/approach - Both primary and secondary data were used. Primary data were collected by use of structured questionnaires from 128 male-headed households and 122 female-headed households in eight villages in the Nguru Local Government Area, as well as from key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Findings - Climate change is not a concept recognized by most farmers and does not have standard translation in the local language; farmers believe the term refers to change in weather. Drought and crop failure are causing despair and frustration, and farmers reported that they are struggling to adapt. The resources and support inputs required for responding to climate change and variability are socially differentiated by gender, women's and men's responses to drought impacts as well as their access to adaptation resources and support differ significantly. Women are in particular unable to access the favored adaptation strategies promoted by Yobe State Agricultural Development Programme as a government support institution assigned with the responsibility of helping farm households adapt to climate change in ways that will increase their adaptive capacity. Originality/value - These findings are essential for informing policy decisions by ensuring that the experiences of both women and men and the context in which they operate are embedded into policy design.",0.9298606035178911,0.28990067437209116,0.07471510760711304,0.6931205302494874,0.03576745839587598,0.030853754891422534,0.13405672845247485
Adapting maize production to drought in the Northeast Farming Region of China,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is the most prominent crop in the Northeast Farming Region of China (NFR), and drought has been the largest limitation for maize production in this area during recent decades. The question of how to adapt maize production to drought has received great attention from policy makers, researchers and farmers. In order to evaluate the effects of adaptation strategies against drought and examine the influences of policy supports and farmer households' characteristics on adopting decisions, a large scale household survey was conducted in five representative maize production counties across NFR. Our survey results indicated that using variety diversification, drought resistant varieties and dibbling irrigation are the three major adaptation strategies against drought in spring, and farmers also adopted changes in sowing time, conservation tillage and mulching to cope with drought in spring. About 20% and 18% of households enhanced irrigation against drought in summer and autumn, respectively. Deep loosening tillage and organic fertilizer are also options for farmers to resist drought in summer. Maize yield was highly dependent on soil qualities, with yields on land of high soil quality approximately 1050 kg/ha and 2400 kg/ha higher than for normal and poor soil conditions, respectively. Using variety diversification and drought resistant varieties can respectively increase maize yield by approximately 150 and 220 kg/ha under drought. Conservation tillage increased maize yield by 438-459 kg/ha in drought years. Irrigation improved maize yield by 419-435 kg/ha and 444-463 kg/ha against drought in summer and autumn, respectively. Offering information service, financial and technical support can greatly increase the use of adaptation strategies for farmers to cope with drought. However, only 46% of households received information service, 43% of households received financial support, and 26% of households received technical support against drought from the local government. The maize acreage and the irrigation access are the major factors that influenced farmers' decisions to apply adaptation strategies to cope with drought in each season, but only 25% of households have access to irrigation. This indicates the need for enhanced public support for farmers to better cope with drought in maize production, particularly through improving access to irrigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Fisher's Decisions to Adopt Adaptation Strategies and Expectations for Their Children to Pursue the Same Profession in Chumphon Province, Thailand","Coastal communities and small-scale fisheries are highly vulnerable to climate change. In this study, we aimed to examine fishers' decisions to adapt to climate change and their expectations for their children to pursue the same profession. Data were obtained from fisher households covering 8 districts and 22 sub-districts in the coastal area of Chumphon Province, Thailand, using participatory observation, focus group discussion, and in-person field surveys. A binary logistic regression model was used to determine factors influencing the fishers' decisions and their expectations for their children to inherit their occupation. Results showed that the fishers are aware of the increasing trends in air temperature, sea water temperature, inland precipitation, offshore precipitation, and storms. Increased fishing experience and fishing income increased the likelihood of the fishers applying adaptations to climate change. Looking to the future, fishers with high fishing incomes expect their children to pursue the occupation, whereas increased fishing experience, non-fishing incomes, and perceptions of storms likely discourage them from expecting their children to be fishers. Of the fishers interviewed, 58.06% decided to apply adaptations in response to climate change by incorporating climate-smart agriculture, particularly by cultivating rubber, oil palm, and orchards as a second income source. The adoption of climate-smart fisheries should be considered in relation to the body of local knowledge, as well as the needs and priorities of the fisher community. To cope with the impacts of current and future climate change on coastal communities, the national focal point of adaptation should be climate change, and related governmental agencies should pay more attention to these key factors for adaptation.",0.7744953650061932,0.31162449030434064,0.1447524569196196,0.4191702205637614,0.3290519940574954,0.05876903406616756,0.07983987397321289
Adaptation financing for projects focused on food systems through the UNFCCC,"Investments in adaptation are required to reduce vulnerability and strengthen the resilience of food systems to the impacts of climate change. For low-income nations, international financing plays a central role in supporting adaptation. In this article, we document and examine adaptation projects targeting food systems financed through funding bodies of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We find that between 2004 and 2015, 3% (n=96) of adaptation projects supported through the UNFCCC explicitly focused on the production, processing, distribution, preparation and/or consumption of food, with US$546 m mobilized through funding bodies directly and US$1.44bn through co-financing. Agriculture is the most common sector supported, with extreme weather events the primary climate change-related impact motivating nations to apply for adaptation financing. The majority of actions are documented to adapt the food production component of food systems, with limited focus within projects on the full range of food system vulnerability and the implications on food security.Key policy insights Enhanced international adaptation financing targeting food systems is needed, and in particular financing to address limited adaptation readinessSupported food system projects should include holistic assessments of the entire food system in order to prioritize sector and food system component issue areas for short- and long-term efficiencyTo better analyse food system linkages and aid in the prioritization of adaptation activities, adaptation-directed funds should consider placing a higher emphasis on a cross-sectoral approach within projectsLinkages between official development assistance and adaptation-directed funds could help optimize financing for food systems and mainstream food system adaptation efforts",0.737106498786851,0.2927000776868723,0.16661219943357117,0.4555365858803377,0.13045863477098396,0.04568050072209409,0.07058059276598094
Use and perceptions of alternative economic activities among smallholder coffee farmers in Huehuetenango and El Quiché departments in Guatemala,"In the past two decades, Mesoamerican smallholder coffee farmers have had to confront several stressors and shocks, such as price crises and natural disasters, with debilitating impacts on the viability of their livelihoods. More recently, many farmers have suffered crop losses in the wake of the spread of coffee leaf rust disease, and researchers are predicting that some areas will become less suitable for coffee growing in the near future as a result of climate change. For these reasons, many have called for the promotion of livelihood diversification as an additional component of rural development programs. This study uses thematic analysis of transcripts from 15 interviews with members of a regional Guatemalan coffee cooperative, Asociación Barillense de Agricultores, based on four different interview guides. Coffee remains the primary livelihood strategy of the respondents, whereas most other activities appear to offer relatively small contributions to incomes, with the exception of honey and a small sewing shop. Some of the farmer responses reflect coping mechanisms rather than risk management. The study also identified other themes mediating diversification, including income-smoothing, optimization, familiarity, social networks, and influences from external actors. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",0.8883982021038423,0.2763079062143401,0.09107444992207436,0.5360918305884246,0.03817725991203441,0.023786015306976077,0.043231845680173145
Building livelihood resilience: what role does agroforestry play?,"Understanding how to build livelihood resilience to an uncertain future is critical as livelihood systems must adapt to local and regional climatic change. Agroforestry, the integration of trees into an agricultural landscape, is one potential solution. However, while many intuitively link agroforestry with livelihood resilience, there is little factual evidence. This paper utilizes data from semi-arid Isiolo County, Kenya to explore if and how agroforestry is building livelihood resilience for smallholder farmers. This study included 20 qualitative case study households, 339 quantitative household surveys, and key informant interviews. In order to measure livelihood resilience, we drew from the five livelihood capital assets of the sustainable livelihoods approach: financial, human, social, physical, and natural capital. The major benefits of agroforestry were shade and fruit; the main tree species planted included mango, papaya, banana, guava, and neem. The average of all five livelihood capital scores was 10% higher for households practising agroforestry, indicating that those households may have more resilient livelihoods. Livelihood capitals were improved by both on-farm diversification and off-farm livelihood diversification. Agroforestry improved the overall quality of life for respondents. This paper provides four major findings that may be applied to build livelihood resilience through agroforestry.",0.9140889049175288,0.2878674853108608,0.18972878146712296,0.6567461998751134,0.030899873222892456,0.02349074579913956,0.05306864634930649
"Trade-offs for climate-resilient pastoral livelihoods in wildlife conservancies in the Mara ecosystem, Kenya","Pastoralists in the wildlife-rich East African rangelands use diversification into conservation and tourism as a strategy to supplement livestock-based livelihoods and to spread risk. Tourism incomes are an important alternative source during drought, when livestock incomes decline. However, tourism may also reduce access to rangeland resources, and an abundant wildlife may destroy crops and injure, kill or transmit disease to livestock or people. This paper investigates the ability of wildlife conservancies in the Mara, Kenya, to act as an alternative for pastoralists that mitigates risks and maintains resilience in a changing climate. It analyses data to examine how conservancies contribute to and integrate with pastoral livelihoods, and to understand how pastoralists are managing their livestock herds in response to conservancies. It finds conservancy payments can provide an important, reliable, all-year-round source of income and prevent households from selling their animals during stress and for cash needs. Conservancies also retain grass banks during the dry season and provide opportunities for pastoralists to access good-quality forage. However, they reduce access to large areas of former grazing land and impose restrictions on livestock mobility. This affects the ability of pastoralists to remain flexible and able to access seasonally variable resources. Conflicts between grazing and conservancies may also heighten during drought times. Furthermore, income from land leases is not more than the contribution of livestock, meaning conservancy land leases create trade-offs for livestock-based livelihoods. Also, income is based on land ownership, which has inequity implications: women and other marginalised groups are left out.",0.8384410796813201,0.3231696030558912,0.14260165250768306,0.6207480677335047,0.02825601294752478,0.018241251142243366,0.02567285857457113
Can Protection Motivation Theory Explain Farmers' Adaptation to Climate Change Decision Making in The Gambia?,"In The Gambia, climate change has affected, and continues to affect, the agriculture sector. Thus, there is a need to develop and understand effective agricultural adaptation policies. The present study used protection motivation theory to describe farmers' adoption of climate change adaptation measures in the Central River Region of The Gambia. Primary data were collected in eight communities of the region. A transect walk was conducted, followed by a survey of farmers (n = 283). Perception data collected referred back to the past 20 years, with stated implementation addressing current adaptation practices. Results showed that the perception variables, namely, severity, ability to withstand, and internal barriers, were significantly correlated with protection motivation, while protection motivation and stated implementation for water conservation technique were strongly correlated. Structural equation modeling confirmed the mediation role of protection motivation between farmers' ""stated implementation"" of adaptation measures and their perception of climate variability. A decrease in soil water storage capacity, degradation of the quality of soil surface structure, and a decrease of the length of the growing season are all factors that motivate farmers to implement an adaptation measure. The cost of the implementation and farmers' vulnerability are factors that prevent implantation of adaptation measures. This study suggested that farmers' resilience should be improved and adaptation measures should be subsidized in order to make them more accessible to farmers.",0.9410784825384213,0.20891200057515477,0.07663093268861261,0.3420922016407016,0.03178407394115466,0.04360667733671901,0.11208001228116964
Contract farming and the adoption of climate change coping and adaptation strategies in the northern region of Ghana,"In climate change adaptation, contract farming can facilitate the adoption of coping and adaptation strategies, but such dynamics are less understood in the literature. This study uses primary data collected from a cross section of crop farmers in northern Ghana and a simultaneous equation systems approach to examine the links between contract farming and adoption of climate change coping and adaptation strategies. The major coping and adaptation strategies used by farmers include spraying of farms with chemicals, row planting, mixed farming, mixed cropping and crop rotation. Econometric results confirm that contract farming enhances the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies, but there is also a feedback effect on contract farming, such that farmers adopting more adaptation strategies have higher probabilities to get contract offer. This makes contract farming a viable policy instrument to consider in climate change adaptation. Furthermore, land ownership and extension services exert significant positive influence on adoption. As much as possible, coping and adaptation strategies should effectively be communicated to crop farmers. Policy-wise, development actors and successive governments in Ghana should encourage and facilitate contract or group farming, as was in the case of the National Block Farming, led by Ghana's Ministry of Food and Agriculture.",0.9588907789213251,0.1852103664756052,0.08193651098022277,0.6669679718455137,0.033710215731376426,0.022379810713133177,0.01827951702614518

Effect of climate-smart agricultural practices on household food security in smallholder production systems: Micro-level evidence from Kenya,"Background: Climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa has had a negative impact on agricultural production leading to food insecurity. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices have the potential to reverse this trend because of its triple potential benefits of improved productivity and high income, reduction or removal of greenhouse gases and improved household food security. Hence, we empirically find the determinants of choice and the effect of CSAs on household food security among smallholder farmers in Kenya. Methods: Primary data were collected in Teso North Sub-county, Busia County of Kenya, among smallholder farmers. CSA practices used by farmers were grouped by principal component analysis and linked to food security by multinomial endogenous switching regression model. Results: With the application of principal component analysis, we clustered the CSA practices into 4 components: crop management, field management, farm risk reduction and soil management practices. We find that the greatest effect of CSA adoption by smallholder farmers on food security is when they use a larger package that contains all the four categories of practices. Adopters of this package were 56.83% more food secure in terms of HFCS and 25.44% in terms of HDDS. This package mitigates upon the impacts of climate change as well as enhancing nutrient availability in the soils for higher productivity. Further, adoption of this package was positively influenced by genderof the household head, farm size and value of productive farm assets. Conclusions: CSAs have the potential to alleviate food insecurity among smallholder farmers if used in combinations and to a larger extend. To enhance adoption, land fragmentation should be discouraged through civic education and provision of alternative income-generating activities for farmers to benefit when practiced on relatively bigger land. Farmers should be sensitized on the need to invest in farm productive assets in order to absorb the risks of climate change while enhancing adoption of CSA practices. © 2018 The Author(s).",0.9929010345238806,0.12083402586069673,0.07477199896295315,0.6641199550802287,0.013677040153025007,0.005551319849686186,0.004053655246638867

Climate change and crop diversity: farmers' perceptions and adaptation on the Bolivian Altiplano,"Crop diversity is central to traditional risk management practices on the Andean Altiplano and may find renewed importance in adapting to climate change. This study explored the role of crop diversity in farmers' adaptation actions in eight Aymara communities on the northern Bolivian Altiplano. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, including multifactor analysis and a community resilience self-assessment, we investigated how farmers' use of diversity in adaptation is related to their perceptions of crop and variety tolerances and other environmental, social, and economic factors. Few crops and varieties were perceived as tolerant to increasingly intense and unpredictable drought, frost, hail, and pest and disease outbreaks. Some local crops and varieties were perceived as vulnerable to emerging conditions (e.g. oca, papalisa, isao), whereas bitter potatoes and wild relatives of quinoa and caahua were perceived as highly stress tolerant and provide food in harsh periods. A total 19% of households surveyed (N = 193) had introduced new crops or varieties-often disease resistant or early maturing-as an adaptive action. Introduction of commercial crops was a common adaptation action, reflecting farmers' response to warming temperatures and changing economic opportunities, but greater sensitivity of the introduced crops may cause maladaptation. Despite intensification of cropping systems, households continue to maintain a median four potato varieties with different tolerance traits, yet this risk management practice was not perceived as adaptation. Strengthening resilience will require a combination of actions, including maintaining and expanding crop portfolios and restoring soil and ecosystem health, using both traditional and innovative approaches.",0.8925386999324432,0.21188099650846112,0.07204090007673652,0.4176201155567358,0.04554945499985809,0.026276256108951627,0.02179991198950315
Farmers' perception of drought and its socioeconomic impact: the case of Tigray and Afar regions of Ethiopia,"A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2016 to June 2016 to assess the perception of farmers on drought and its socio-economic impact, and their mitigation and adaptation strategies. A total of 240 respondents from three districts in Tigray and one district from Afar were considered. The study indicated a significant reduction in the farm income (from 21,882 to 6482 ETB) and income from the livestock sector (12,833 to 5659 ETB). The average market price of cattle has reduced from 8228 to 4096 ETB due to the 2015/2016 drought. The environmental impacts such as increase in average temperature, pasture-forest degradation and deteriorated water quality were perceived by farmers to a high extent. In spite of good perception of severity of drought impacts by farmers, their preparedness to deal with its impacts was found minimal. Therefore, it is recommended that policy-makers and government authorities should look for more appropriate and locally adaptable mitigation and adaptation strategies that ensure the participation of the local community.",0.9375227112200738,0.1974897928447879,0.0748520493345356,0.44621858672471415,0.03267263152131137,0.03263064405027707,0.1192933620189683
Place-based or sector-based adaptation? A case study of municipal and fishery policy integration,"Place-based adaptation planning is an approach to address cross-sectoral and multi-level governance concerns as well as to build local adaptive capacity in vulnerable resource-dependent communities facing the adverse impacts of climate change. In contrast, sector-based adaptation planning focuses on addressing climate change impacts on individual economic sectors (e.g. fisheries or forestry) or sub-sectors (such as lobsters or timber). Yet, linking sectoral approaches with local adaptation policies is challenging. More effort is needed to identify opportunities for complementary adaptation strategies and policy integration to foster multiple benefits. In this article, we use a case study of fishery sector resources and municipal adaptation planning in Nova Scotia to demonstrate how meaningful entry points could catalyse policy integration and lead to co-benefits across multiple levels and stakeholder groups. Drawing on a fisheries systems and fish chain framework, we identify and assess several entry points for policy integration across sector-and place-based adaptation domains within coastal habitats, as well as harvesting, processing, and marketing sectors. The analysis highlights the multiple benefits of integrating local municipal adaptation plans with multi-scale resource sectors especially towards monitoring ecosystem changes, protecting essential infrastructure, and securing local livelihoods. POLICY RELEVANCE Climate change is having a growing impact on coastal communities around the world, with consequences for sea-level rise, critical habitats, essential infrastructure, and multiple economic sectors and industries. This Canadian case study demonstrates how municipal adaptation initiatives can be complementary to sector-based adaptation at both local and regional levels through various entry points across commodity production chains. Policy integration across place-based and sector-based adaptation processes should lead to multiple benefits such as conserving marine biodiversity, protecting essential infrastructure, and securing livelihoods. Our analysis, which focuses specifically on the fishery sector and coastal communities, shows that these co-benefits may arise particularly in such coastal-marine systems and provide policy lessons to terrestrial systems and other sectors.",0.13974236788626826,0.42579652492935327,0.21524167852922296,0.17357577955839748,0.4499872652387507,0.37291174617753836,0.12388349291982483
Developing climate-smart agriculture to face climate variability in West Africa: Challenges and lessons learnt,"This paper reviewed the prospects for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) development and promotion in West Africa as well as lessons learnt and challenges with a focus on climate change and variability. It was evident from the literature that West Africa is vulnerable to climate change and variability, on account of its socio-economic and physical characteristics. As climate change and variability persists, the region's quest to use agriculture as the mainstream opportunity to deliver on set targets of the sustainable development goals will be strongly challenged without appropriate interventions. Adopting CSA seems to be a suitable strategy to achieving food security while also mitigating and adapting to climate-related risks. Among numerous CSA technologies, the review found (1) agroforestry (farmer-managed natural regenerations), soil and water conservation technologies (zai, half-moon, tie/contour ridges, conservation agriculture) and (3) climate information services as highly valued promising options for climate change adaptation and risk management in West Africa. In addition, institutional settings at the community, national and regional levels such as the establishment of multi-stakeholder innovation platforms, national science policy dialogue platforms on CSA in parts of West Africa and the formulation of the West Africa CSA Alliance were found to be crucial in promoting capacity development and awareness of CSA technologies and innovations in the region. The review found that CSA still faces a number of challenges, including: lack of clear conceptual understanding, limited enabling policy and financing. The prospects of CSA in West Africa hinge on the capacities of farming households and the region's national institutions to understand the environmental, economic and social challenges in the context of climate change, and consequently self-mobilize to develop and implement responsive policies at appropriate scales.

Climate change adaptation and cross-sectoral policy coherence in southern Africa,"To be effective, climate change adaptation needs to be mainstreamed across multiple sectors and greater policy coherence is essential. Using the cases of Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia, this paper investigates the extent of coherence in national policies across the water and agriculture sectors and to climate change adaptation goals outlined in national development plans. A two-pronged qualitative approach is applied using Qualitative Document Analysis of relevant policies and plans, combined with expert interviews from non-government actors in each country. Findings show that sector policies have differing degrees of coherence on climate change adaptation, currently being strongest in Zambia and weakest in Tanzania. We also identify that sectoral policies remain more coherent in addressing immediate-term disaster management issues of floods and droughts rather than longer-term strategies for climate adaptation. Coherence between sector and climate policies and strategies is strongest when the latter has been more recently developed. However to date, this has largely been achieved by repackaging of existing sectoral policy statements into climate policies drafted by external consultants to meet international reporting needs and not by the establishment of new connections between national sectoral planning processes. For more effective mainstreaming of climate change adaptation, governments need to actively embrace longer-term cross-sectoral planning through cross-Ministerial structures, such as initiated through Zambia's Interim Climate Change Secretariat, to foster greater policy coherence and integrated adaptation planning.",0.26172168365657644,0.36356355096053633,0.20398037850887066,0.33171518977583636,0.12674792193293133,0.27281938875602385,0.2973929240219453
Farmers' Perceptions of and Adaptations to Changing Climate in the Melamchi Valley of Nepal,"Knowledge of farmers' perceptions of and adaptations to climate change is important to inform policies addressing the risk of climate change to farmers. This case study explored those issues in the Melamchi Valley of Nepal through a survey of 365 households and focus group discussions in 6 communities using a Community-Based Risk Screening Tool-Adaptation and Livelihoods (CRiSTAL). Analysis of climate trends in the study area for 1979-2009 showed that mean annual temperatures rose by 1.02 degrees C and the frequency of drought increased measurably after 2003. Farmers reported increases in crop pests, hailstorms, landslides, floods, thunderstorms, and erratic precipitation as climate-related hazards affecting agriculture. They responded in a variety of ways including changing farming practices, selling livestock, milk, and eggs, and engaging in daily wage labor and seasonal labor migration. With more efficient support and planning, some of these measures could be adjusted to better meet current and future risks from climate change.",0.9350140445967293,0.2545688692893453,0.09261303334324926,0.4751495501473473,0.04545678949822716,0.023540259405944106,0.09085013706151472
Agricultural risk management: Lesson learned from the application of rice crop insurance in Indonesia,"Climate change has negative impacts on production of food crops, especially rice, the staple food for the majority of Indonesians. The Government of Indonesia has to manage the agricultural development to adapt to climate anomalies and protect farmers' welfare. Agricultural insurance is introduced to share risks caused by perils and natural disasters. The pilot rice crop insurance has been successfully implemented in several rice-producing areas with positive responses from farmers. The sum insured by the indemnity-based insurance is six million Indonesian rupiah per hectare for one planting season, and the premium rate is set at 3 %. While 80 % of the premium is paid under the government subsidy scheme, the remaining 20 % is born by farmers themselves. Farmers who participate in this scheme are required to follow guideline on agricultural practices, while they are protected from crop damage caused by the named perils (flood, drought, pests, and disease). The partnership among the government as a regulator, insurance company as an insurer, and farmers as the insured needs to be further promoted to enhance the implementation of rice crop insurance. © Springer Japan 2016.

Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation of participation in collective actions and adoption of climate-smart farming technologies in South–West Nigeria,"Enhancing sustainable food security requires agricultural production systems to change in the direction of higher productivity and to mitigate lower output variability in the face of climate extreme related hazards such as land degradation. Adoption of resilient food production system capable of withstanding disruptive events is therefore needed to stabilize farmers’ productivity. Consequently, participation in collective actions has been touted as an effective approach to enhance cooperation among individuals within a social system and to advance adoption of climate-smart farming techniques (conservation agriculture). This study investigated this perspective using heterogeneous treatment effects estimation to analyze the data collected from 350 smallholder farmers selected randomly from the South–West Nigeria. The average treatment effects on the treated estimate revealed that participation in collective actions had adoption-increasing effect for each unit variation in propensity score rank, although, negative selection effect was suspected. Similarly, information acquisition, access to extension service and frequency of visit by extension workers are significant features that predict adoption in the study area. However, rosenbaum sensitivity analysis test revealed that the increasing effect of participation in collective actions on conservation agriculture adoption is insensitive to unobserved bias that may double or triple the odds of exposure to treatment. Hence, the average treatment effect on the treated estimate is a pure impact of the participation in collective actions. The study concluded that farmers with high propensity to participate in collective action have high likelihood to adopt climate-resilient farming practices compared to the counterparts with a lower propensity of participation in collective action. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",0.9138198627733009,0.18604470453666053,0.08406801309525402,0.4676850974792486,0.03639864058078852,0.02192019661164303,0.03231159329342814
Determinants of adaptation strategies to climate and its impact on rice farmers’ net farm income in South-West Nigeria,"A multivariate probit (MVP) model was used to analyse the determinants of strategies adopted for adapting to climate change in a sample of smallholder rice farmers in south-west Nigeria. An efficient endogenous switching regression model (ESRM) was used to estimate the impact of climate change adaptation strategy on the net income of rice farmers. The MVP results show that the socio-economic factors, the institutional factors, and locational variables of some households statistically influenced the choice of climate change adaptation strategies employed. Complementarities among all the adaptation strategies used by the farmers were revealed by the positive pair-wise correlation matrix of the MVP model. The study also indicated that farmers affected by prolonged drought and incidences of flood were more likely to adopt adaptation strategies on their farmlands. The ESRM treatment effect indicated that the average net income per rice farm of those who adopted the strategies was significantly higher than that of those who did not. Thus, the government, stakeholders, and donor agencies must provide capacity-building innovations related to agricultural extension systems and climate change education through information and communication technologies. This investment in education is essential for development and would encourage farmers to adopt appropriate climate change adaptation strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",0.9697426305515074,0.1876272341709026,0.048437652988998964,0.6803938934501542,0.0268320561489715,0.025053143784849737,0.03768579368303227
Determinants of smallholder farmers' decision to adopt adaptation options to climate change and variability in the Muger Sub basin of the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia,"Smallholder farmers' decisions to adopt adaptation options in response to climate change and variability are influenced by socioeconomic, institutional, and environmental factors, indicating that decision patterns can be very specific to a given locality. The prime objective of this research is to identify factors affecting smallholder farmers' decisions to adopt adaptation options to climate change and variability in the Muger River sub-basin of the Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire, focused group discussions, and key informant interviews from 442 sampled households. Frequency, mean, Chi-square test, and one-way ANOVA were used for analysis. Furthermore, a multinomial logit model was employed to analyze the data. Results signified that small-scale irrigation, agronomic practices, livelihood diversification, and soil and water conservation measures are the dominant adaptation options that smallholder farmers used to limit the negative impact of climate change and variability in the study area. The results further revealed that adoption of small-scale irrigation as an adaptation to climate change and variability is significantly and positively influenced by access to credit, social capital, and the educational status of household heads. Greater distance to marketplace and size of farmland negatively affected the use of agronomic practices, whereas crop failure experience and access to early warning systems have a positive influence. The results also point out that adoption of soil and water conservation measures are positively affected by exposure to early warning systems, greater distance to the marketplace, and larger size of cultivated land. It is also noted that livelihood diversification is negatively influenced by socioeconomic factors such as education, the gender of the household head, and livestock ownership. Overall, the results suggested that improved policies aimed at increasing the adoption of adaptation options to offset the impact of climate change and variability should focus on: creating effective microfinance institutions and effective early warning systems, increasing farmer awareness, improving infrastructure, and encouraging farmers' membership to many social groups. The results further suggested that agroecological and gender-based research should be promoted and increased for a more holistic understanding of farmer adaptation options. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.974512204957347,0.13281580143915053,0.0844243319451575,0.6353172344778649,0.02503974864493217,0.008621540844930413,0.04266191234047017
An empirical analysis of effective factors on farmers adaptation behavior in water scarcity conditions in rural communities,"This paper investigates the effect of factors on Farmers Adaptation Behavior in Water Scarcity Conditions in Rural Communities of Sabzevar, Iran. A survey questionnaire was used for collecting data, the study population was 120 farmers in rural Sabzevar County selected based on the Cochran formula. A questionnaire was designed for the target group for the measurement of on farm adaptation behavior in water scarcity conditions. Research models were drawn using structural equation modeling and the relationships between latent variables and indicators. The findings indicate that there is a significant relationship between awareness and adaptation behavior. Meanwhile, there is a significant relationship among network and media on farmer's perception about water scarcity and their activities toward better management of water in the critical condition. There are also significant relationships among perception and awareness with intention however, intention do not effect on adaptation behavior strongly. In other words, even the that means farmers had information about crisis, they are not able to have not operational plans to confront the water scarcity conditions.

Adaptation to climate change in Bangladesh,"Climate change is expected to disproportionately affect agriculture in Bangladesh; however, there is limited information on smallholder farmers' overall vulnerability and adaptation needs. This article estimates the impact of climatic shocks on the household agricultural income and, subsequently, on farmers' adaptation strategies. Relying on data from a survey conducted in several communities in Bangladesh in 2011 and based on an IV probit approach, the results show that a 1 percentage point (pp) climate-induced decline in agricultural income pushes Bangladeshi households to adapt by almost 3 pp. Moreover, Bangladeshi farmers undertake a variety of adaptation options. However, several barriers to adaptation were identified, noticeably access to electricity and wealth. In this respect, policies can be implemented in order to assist the Bangladeshi farming community to adapt to climate change. Policy relevance This study contributes to the literature of adaptation to climate change by providing evidence of existing risk-coping strategies and by showing how a household's ability to adapt to weather-related risk can be limited. This study helps to inform the design of policy in the context of increasing climatic stress on the smallholder farmers in Bangladesh.",0.8817546366568773,0.26181109479311065,0.07993116947856208,0.5962323151404135,0.04209030671268254,0.018382840174135842,0.018854538268812445
Smallholder farmers' social networks and resource-conserving agriculture in Ghana: a multicase comparison using exponential random graph models,"We examined what type of information network structures lie within rural cooperatives and what these structures mean for promoting resource-conserving agriculture. To better understand whether and how environmental outcomes are linked to these microlevel social relations or network structures, we quantified individual farm-and community-level biomass accumulation and carbon stocks associated with the adoption of agroforestry, a set of farming techniques for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. We also collected social network data on individual farmers across five communities. This empirical evidence was derived from primary fieldwork conducted in the Ghanaian semideciduous cocoa (Theobroma cacao)-growing region. This data set was examined using standard network analysis, combined with exponential random graph models (ERGMs). The key findings suggest that farmers with more biomass accumulation from the adoption of agroforestry practices also tend to be popular advisers to their peers at the local level. Presumably, farmers seek peers who demonstrate clear signs of achieving successful land management goals. Using ERGMs, we also show that commonly observed individual-level results might not scale to the collective level. We discuss how our individual-scale findings could be leveraged to foster farmer-to-farmer social learning and knowledge exchange associated with resource-conserving agricultural practices. However, we also highlight that effective whole networks, such as cooperative collectives in these communities, remain elusive.",0.8021726550186398,0.31260555206485485,0.13967401468332175,0.43380537903078165,0.05607976698886445,0.038264218952681554,0.08732374281481385
Determinants of Farmers' Decisions on Risk Coping Strategies in Rural West Java,"The impact of natural hazards on agriculture in Indonesia is becoming increasingly severe. Therefore, improving farmers' capacity to undertake risk coping strategies is essential to maintaining their prosperity. The objective of this study was to investigate the determinants of farmers' decisions on ex ante and ex post coping strategies in rural West Java, Indonesia. The study was based on a field survey of 180 farmers conducted in the Garut district from July to October 2017. The study used the protection motivation theory framework and applied three econometric models: binomial logit model, zero truncated Poisson regression model, and multinomial logit model. Most farmers (74.4%) adopted ex ante coping strategies. They were characterized as having higher risk aversion per capita expenditure and disaster experience, but lower discount rates and percentage of damage and locations in downstream and midstream areas. Coping appraisal perceptions were found to be important factors in the risk coping analysis. Four determinants of the decision on the number of ex ante coping strategies adopted were: per capita expenditure, land size, disaster experience, and access to financial institutions. The most common ex post coping strategy adopted by farmers was the middle-stress type.",0.8413941124373956,0.22215939203299995,0.03950582140742242,0.6712967212682743,0.020644461719449232,0.027614458123072103,0.08396344992335097
Climate Change Adaptation Strategies of Smallholder Agroforestry Farmers in the Philippines,"This article argues that smallholder agroforestry farmers in the selected provinces in the Philippines have already been experiencing climate change in their respective areas as indicated by the change in the rainfall and temperature patterns. Using direct interviews and focus group discussions, the respondent-farmers highlighted that increased incidence of pests and diseases, stunted growth of crops, low crop productivity, delayed planting, delayed fruiting of some crops particularly perennial species, poor quality of produce, increased cost in farm operations, low income and decreased yield of some crops, are among the general impacts of climate change in their agricultural production systems. On the positive aspect, some crops had increased yield as an impact of climate change. The farmers employ their local knowledge and skills in adapting to the impacts of climate change. Among these include changing cropping patterns, integrating more crops in the farm, engaging in other off-farm and non-farm activities as additional source of income, changing the cultivated crops, mulching, and using organic fertilizers, among others. This article also highlights the benefits that the respondent-farmers derive from agroforestry, a land use management system that is currently being practiced in the study sites.",0.9784199820395607,0.17757589426993645,0.10546238421882449,0.5591579665254807,0.019095222710121613,0.00702098737332594,0.021239494323424202
Exploring the autonomous adaptation strategies to climate change and climate variability in selected villages in the rural northern savannah zone of Ghana,"Evidence abounds attesting to changes in the global climate. In Ghana, climate change and climate variability have brought several exposure-sensitivities on different people and at different times. Due to the multiplicity of climate change and climate variability effects, adaptation strategies invariably could be influenced by several factors. This paper assesses the adoption of adaptation strategies in the rural northern savannah zone of Ghana as a result of climate change and variability. Using two villages each from Savelugu Nanton, West Mamprusi and Kassena Nankana East Districts, which are slightly different as case studies, the paper unearthed panoply of varied adaptation strategies in each of them including intensification of irrigation; integration of livestock production; changes in tillage practices; fertiliser application on farms; shift from agriculture to non-farm jobs; seasonal migration and purchase of drought insurance for maize. The results indicate that the relativity in adoption and utilisation of the different adaptive strategies are interlinked with geographical, social, economic, institutional and political factors and processes in the villages. The findings drum home the essentiality of location-specific planned adaptation strategies for climate change through a bottom-up approach, in order to ensure their effectiveness and sustainability.",0.8885280519172354,0.23833369219149,0.09758875139773313,0.5511607688011569,0.04102743910510109,0.029953936801124202,0.05380308165266704
Climate change and adaptation on selected crops in Southern Philippines,"Purpose - This paper aims to assess the vulnerability of the farmer-respondents in Southern Philippines, specifically Region XI and XII, to climate change. Design/methodology/approach - This study conducted an empirical analysis of the impact of climate change on maize (Zea mays), banana (Musa sapientum) and durian (Durio zibethinus) production. Furthermore, it estimated the determinants of adaptation to climate change and its corresponding effect on farm productivity. The analysis used primary data from 541 farmer-respondents producing maize, banana and durian in the 6 provinces and 18 municipalities of the sample areas. Findings - Based on the probit estimate results, farmers adaptation decisions were influenced by information about future climate change conditions, social capital, access to formal extension and farmer-to-farmer extension. The author found from the stochastic frontier estimation in the production function that climate change adaptations exerted a significant impact on farm productivity. It helped in coping with the adverse effects and risk of climate change while increasing agricultural productivities of the farmer-respondents. Originality/value - This research paper will be an addition to the body of knowledge on the socioeconomic aspects on the climate change and adaptation on the production of maize, banana and durian in the case of a developing country like Southern Philippines. This will bring more insights into the adaptation strategies that are crucial to cope with climatic variability and change.",0.9105994723326641,0.2590120792858275,0.10801449898246071,0.5,0.03448488963114247,0.02993754189328331,0.02549958783317151
Livestock farming systems and climate change: perception of farmers and adaptation strategies,"Due to the increasing hazards tied to climate change, French livestock farmers are looking for effective adaptation strategies in order to secure forage production. Three research programmes were implemented in order to analyse the perception of climate change by farmers, and assess the adaptation strategies they have implemented in order to deal with this problem, in different situations and livestock systems: Climaster in the western region of France, Climfourel in the Mediterranean region and Climadapt in the Northern Alps. The cross analysis of experience acquired as a result of these 3 projects makes it possible to determine a typology for the different adaptation strategies implemented by farmers (ranging from short term adaptation strategies during droughts to long term changes in farming practices and livestock systems). Climate change is one of the factors, among others, contributing to the changing face of livestock systems.",0.922674981766523,0.20985459500577233,0.13034316344767893,0.636938156574393,0.037294310475809625,0.021600097121984657,0.05309884561001446
Governance arrangements and adaptive decision-making in rice farming systems in Northern Ghana,"Climate variability has consequences on water availability in rice farming systems. In Ghana, rice farmers in the Northern Savannah are amongst the most vulnerable to long periods of drought and erratic rainfall conditions. Within the Kumbungu district, farmers engaged in both rain-fed and irrigated rice farming are no exception. Coping with uncertain water availability conditions requires adaptive decision-making for sustained productivity in rice cropping. From an adaptive governance perspective, the extent to which formal and traditional governance arrangements enable adaptive decisions amongst rice farmers remains a key question. Using an exploratory research design, the study investigates three key questions; what water-dependent decisions rice farmers take and how these are adaptive to changing water availability conditions; what formal and informal governance arrangements rice cropping decisions are embedded in; and how existing governance arrangements enable or constrain adaptive decision-making. Rice farmers in twelve communities around the Bontanga Irrigation Scheme in the Kumbungu District in the Northern region were engaged through individual interviews and focus group discussions. The study reveals that farmers take six major water-dependent decisions throughout the cropping season; decision to or not to plant rice, land preparation, planting, weed control, fertilizer application and harvesting. Farmer decisions are most adaptive to water availability conditions during planting and fertilizer application. Both formal and traditional governance arrangements influence the extent to which farmers are able to adapt to changes in water availability conditions.

Agricultural adaptation to climate change: insights from a farming community in Sri Lanka,"The vulnerability of smallholder farmers to climate change and variability is increasingly rising. As agriculture is the only source of income for most of them, agricultural adaptation with respect to climate change is vital for their sustenance and to ensure food security. In order to develop appropriate strategies and institutional responses, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the farmers' perception of climate change, actual adaptations at farm-level and what factors drive and constrain their decision to adapt. Thus, this study investigates the farm-level adaptation to climate change based on the case of a farming community in Sri Lanka. The findings revealed that farmers' perceived the ongoing climate change based on their experiences. Majority of them adopted measures to address climate change and variability. These adaptation measures can be categorised into five groups, such as crop management, land management, irrigation management, income diversification, and rituals. The results showed that management of non-climatic factors was an important strategy to enhance farmers' adaptation, particularly in a resource-constrained smallholder farming context. The results of regression analysis indicated that human cognition was an important determinant of climate change adaptation. Social networks were also found to significantly influence adaptation. The study also revealed that social barriers, such as cognitive and normative factors, are equally important as other economic barriers to adaptation. While formulating and implementing the adaptation strategies, this study underscored the importance of understanding socio-economic, cognitive and normative aspects of the local communities.",0.9616420192860411,0.19330769706030262,0.10046883026354785,0.4771455284876666,0.029382035208657224,0.016082932245948957,0.03820492247439277
"Perception of Climate Change and the Adaptation Strategies and Capacities of the Rice Farmers in Kedah, Malaysia","This article attempts to understand the perception of the rice-growing farmers on the issue of climate change (CC) and identify their adaptive capacity (AC). A survey was conducted through structured questionnaires to understand farmers' perception and adaptation strategies in response to changing climate and variability. The findings indicate that farmers are moderately adaptive to CC in the study area. The result also revealed that the main barriers are lack of funds and government support available information to CC. Farmers with higher AC can produce greater amount of rice. Rice producers should be enabled through improved extension services, government aid, such as grants, training for better level of adaptability, to help them achieve higher rice production.",0.9497374352775398,0.21120103748449662,0.09437556856353255,0.464478783439789,0.022343260176009475,0.02398556070810881,0.061417365886967994
Climate change and pastoralists: perceptions and adaptation in montane Kenya,"Tropical montane forests are amongst the most threatened ecosystems by climate change. However, little is known about climatic changes already observed in these montane areas in Africa, or the adaptation strategies used by pastoralist communities. This article, focused on three mountains in northern Kenya, aims to fill these knowledge gaps. Focus-group discussions with village elders were organized in 10 villages on each mountain (n = 30). Villages covered different pastoralist ethnic groups. Historical data on rainfall, temperature and fog were gathered from Marsabit Meteorological station. All participants reported changes in the amount and distribution of rainfall, fog, temperature and wind for the past 20-30 years; regardless of the mountain or ethnicity. They particularly highlighted the reduction in fog. Meteorological evidence on rainfall, temperature and fog agreed with local perceptions; particularly important was a 60% reduction in hours of fog per year since 1981. Starting farming and shifting to camel herding were the adaptive strategies most commonly mentioned. Some adaptive strategies were only mentioned in one mountain or by one ethnic group (e.g. starting the cultivation of khat). We highlight the potential use of local communities' perceptions to complement climatic records in data-deficient areas, such as many tropical mountains, and emphasize the need for more research focused on the adaptation strategies used by pastoralists.",0.8472545255322068,0.27030057604518026,0.12816644119231269,0.558540856578517,0.06294124224420787,0.03968477711300851,0.08509833538751199
"Climate variability, rainfall shocks, and farmers' income diversification in India","Rainfall in India has become much more variable as a result of global climate change. Responses to rain shocks vary depending on the level of climate variation a community experiences historically. Using data spanning three decades in 230 villages in India, I find that farmers tend to diversify their income with non-farm wage jobs in response to rainfall shocks. This diversification strategy is employed less in places with more variable historical weather as people are more adapted. As climate change causes more variable weather in the coming years, my results suggest that places with historically less variable weather may become more vulnerable in this changing climate.

"Perceptions and local adaptation strategies to climate change of marine capture fishermen in Bengkulu Province, Indonesia","Adaptation is a key strategy to reduce the severe impacts of climate change on the fishery. Adaptation strategies are unlikely to be effective without an understanding of the fishermen's perception on climate change. This paper explores fishermen's knowledge on climate change perceptions and their climate change adaptation in response to the perceived impacts of climate change. A survey by interviewing randomly selected 90 marine capture fishermen was conducted in Bengkulu from March to June 2018. The results indicate that most fishermen understand climate change as a change of east and west monsoon that directly affect their fishing activities. In terms of climate change defined as a continuous change of temperature, humidity, and rainfall, most fishermen have no sufficient knowledge on climate change. The important adaptation strategies include diversification of household economic activities, augmenting of fishing gear, change the fishing ground, mobilization of family members to work, and fishing time adjustment.",0.7557774613833327,0.31726791577449226,0.1258679620174914,0.45318752122576267,0.2676136801433803,0.03339049005846559,0.056834016937819386
Climate change adaptation: a study of multiple climate-smart practices in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia,"Improving farm-level use of multiple climate change adaptation strategies is essential for improving household food security, particularly against a backdrop of a high risk of climatic shocks. However, the empirical foundation for understanding how farm households choose multiple climate-smart practices is far from being established. In this paper, the effects of household, farm and climatic factors on farmers' decisions to use multiple adaptation practices are analysed. A survey of 921 farm households and 4312 farm plots combined with historical climate data in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia is explored using multivariate and random effect ordered probit econometric models. Results show agricultural production can be characterized by complementarities between adaptation practices. This result is important to designing packages of adaptation practices. The econometric results confirm that social capital, tenure security and climatic shocks are important determinants of the choice of the type and number of adaptation practices. The results suggest the need for carefully designing combinations of adaptation strategies based on agro-ecological conditions.",0.957289390426474,0.1952740345843354,0.09542093609101038,0.7719079619167427,0.04038258715478254,0.012871323507009983,0.028906616544451372
"Smallholder Farmer Adoption of Climate-Related Adaptation Strategies: The Importance of Vulnerability Context, Livelihood Assets, and Climate Perceptions","Despite increased research characterizing the adaptive capacity of households and communities, there are few empirical studies that test why farmers adopt costly climate-related adaptive strategies, which strategies are implemented, and farmers' perceptions of climate changes. In this study, we analyzed determinants for smallholder farmer adoption of adaptation strategies in Chiapas, Mexico. We conducted 291 surveys with landowners in eight coffee farming communities. Farmers were asked which of 21 adaptation strategies they had engaged in, within five categories: migration, storage, land use diversification, community investment, and market exchange. We found the most frequent strategies included planting shade coffee, diversifying crop varieties, shifting sow date, building living walls, reforesting, or engaging in soil conservation. Although many farmers have experienced natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes, they were most concerned by long-term threats to crops like coffee rust and higher temperatures, that require costly adaptive investments. We find farmers adapt to climate events because of their vulnerability context (i.e., experience with disasters and distance to markets). Land holdings (i.e., natural capital), farm equipment (i.e., physical capital), and group membership (i.e., social capital), were also key factors influencing adaptation. Finally, farmers with strong perceptions of drought and temperature change were most likely to adapt. These results suggest policy makers should have a multi-pronged approach to: improve farmers' resource base through explicitly promoting adaptation strategies like crop and income diversification; inform climate perceptions through workshops on climate and weather; and strengthen participation in community and producer organizations to increase smallholder adaptation.",0.9834230092136041,0.2333711038148055,0.0645383822721969,0.7394217540035913,0.03888859979130738,0.014927279223830825,0.04227254822160347
Farmers’ perceptions and adaptation strategies to climate risks and their determinants: insights from a farming community of Aguie district in Niger,"Globally climate risks are rising, and agriculture remains one of the most affected sectors. Niger is one of the most affected countries, where, there is little knowledge of farmers’ perceptions of climate risks and adaptation strategies. This research aimed to address these knowledge gaps. In total 160 farm households were randomly selected from two villages and respondents were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and a regression model were used for data analysis. Based on the survey results, the perceived risks include temperature increases, short rain season, recurrent droughts, stronger winds, increased pests, and diseases and reduced crop yields. Agronomic practices including crop association and diversification, changing planting dates, use of improved seed varieties, use of mineral fertilizers were implemented as adaptation strategies. Strategy adoption was significantly influenced by farming experience, education, farm and household size, soil fertility, livestock ratio. 80% of farmers adjusted their farming system, and the level of adaptation was significantly determined by soil fertility, climate change information, food production, and number of strategies adopted. This study highlights that policymakers should incorporate communities’ knowledge of environmental change and locally adapted solutions to streamline their transition to sustainability. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",0.9769832193586345,0.22200115163060855,0.07708345209797633,0.56408055226751,0.040228725312952254,0.013943791937891485,0.01779551493824887
"Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies Used by Farmers in Imo State, Nigeria","This study examined the strategies employed by farmers to mitigate the effects of climate change on agricultural practices. A structured interview schedule was used to collect data from 220 farmers. Frequency, percentages and mean statistic were used to present the results of the data collected. The results show that the mean age of the farmers was 51 years with an average of 22 years of farming experience. The majority (75%) of the farmers were aware of climate change within their environment. Self-observation and experience (42.4%) over the years was the source of awareness of climate change. The majority (73.6%) of the farmers opined that in recent times, flooding had increased which is an indication of climate change. Reduction in the use of generator to get power in the farmers' houses (69.1%) and crop rotation practices (67.3%) were mitigation and adaptation strategies employed by the farmers against the effect of climate change. The study recommends that government of states should enforce the policy on afforestation as a mitigation measure against climate change.",0.9775957037719881,0.1368184058161713,0.06368365801958419,0.4773744438155305,0.022776608737553196,0.012654723267765889,0.006468760058221944
"Farmers' perceptions of and adaptation strategies to climate change and their determinants: the case of Punjab province, Pakistan","Climate change is a global environmental threat to all economic sectors, particularly the agricultural sector. Pakistan is one of the countries negatively affected by climate change due to its high exposure to extreme events and low adaptive capacity. In Pakistan, farmers are the primary stakeholders in agriculture and are more at risk due to climate vulnerability. Based on farm household data from 450 households collected from three districts in three agroecological zones in the Punjab province of Pakistan, this study examines how farmers perceive climate change and how they adapt their farming in response to perceived changes in climate. The results demonstrate that awareness of climate change is widespread throughout the area, and farm households make adjustments to adapt their agriculture in response to climatic change. Overall 58% of the farm households adapted their farming to climate change. Changing crop varieties, changing planting dates, planting of shade trees and changing fertilizers were the main adaptation methods implemented by farm households in the study area. The results from the binary logistic model reveal that education, farm experience, household size, land area, tenancy status, ownership of a tube well, access to market information, information on weather forecasting and agricultural extension services all influence farmers' choices of adaptation measures. The results also indicate that adaptation to climate change is constrained by several factors such as lack of information, lack of money, resource constraints and shortage of irrigation water in the study area. Findings of the study suggest the need for greater investment in farmer education and improved institutional setup for climate change adaptation to improve farmers' wellbeing.",0.9756859823093806,0.14811762986661836,0.06272182587074776,0.6542963707250778,0.027096172025960166,0.006933740000847434,0.03231796680246993
Adaptation to Climate Change by Rural Ethnic Communities of Northern Thailand,"Northern Thailand has been experiencing the impact of climate change due to its fragile agro-ecosystem, inhabited by a resource-poor population. The study, conducted in a mountainous landscape of Doi Mae Salong area in Northern Thailand, explores the farmers' perceptions of climate change, its impact on farming, and adaptation measures undertaken by the two ethnic communities in the area for coping with climate change impacts. The data were collected through a structured questionnaire survey of ninety farm households using the recall approach for the past twenty years. The findings suggest that the farmers have perceived the change in climate pattern of the study area, and its negative impact on farming. Farm households have been trying to cope with the impacts by adapting to alternate farming options and practices using traditional techniques. The impact was perceived to be higher in the community living at higher elevation compared to those at lower elevation. Although autonomous adaptation is occurring in the area, the vulnerability of farm households to the impact of climate change still exists in terms of the lack of knowledge and financial resources.",0.8960912924526565,0.24224598190023,0.1005938927094608,0.537822580307624,0.030421764009755825,0.028480023966895057,0.06904916306780885
"Assessing climate change vulnerability and local adaptation strategies in adjacent communities of the Kribi-Campo coastal ecosystems, South Cameroon","Campo coastal area. Variables of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity are described and assessed based on the community's perception and biophysical evidence. Historical changes in rainfall and temperature variables, mangrove cover and occurrence of extreme climatic events are taken as indicators of exposure. Losses of property and income structure are used as indicators of sensitivity. Human, natural, social, financial and physical assets are used as elements of adaptive capacity. Focus group discussions were held with key informants in 12 settlements, and a survey was conducted with 150 household representatives (14 Bagyeli pygmies and 136 Bantou) to gather perceptions on climate change and adaptation strategies. Results show evidence of increased -vulnerability due to decreasing rainfall and irregular rainfall patterns, increasing occurrences of extreme climatic events and increased levels of coastal erosion. These have resulted in several effects, most significantly in the decline of agricultural production, reported by 57% of respondents, and damages to housing reported by 30% of respondents. Adaptive capacities are low. > 60% of respondents do not use any adaptation strategy. All sectors considered, the identified responses to climate related phenomena include early harvesting of crop, farm abandonment, change of productive activity, change of farm location, house reinforcement. The study concludes that households living here are susceptible to the possible impacts of climate change.

"Early warning information, farmers' perceptions of, and adaptations to drought in China","Farmers' perceptions of the local climate reflect their own judgments of climate change and may thus affect their adaptation behavior. However, the mechanisms between the provision of early warning information and farmers' perceptions and adaptation behavior are under-researched. To address this gap in the literature, this study uses original household survey data from nine provinces in China to examine the major factors influencing farmers' perceptions of drought and examines how perceptions affect adaptation behavior. The results show that over half of the sample farmers perceived that drought severity had increased during the past 10 years. Moreover, econometric analysis indicates that about 8% more farmers will adopt surface pipes in response to drought if early warning information about drought is provided. Farmers that perceived increasing drought severity are more likely to attempt to adapt by adopting water-saving technologies.

Smallholder farmers in eastern Africa and climate change: a review of risks and adaptation options with implications for future adaptation programmes,"This article reviews the published evidence of the climatic risks faced by smallholder farmers in eastern Africa and the adaptation strategies these farmers have so far adopted. In addition, the study draws on two detailed case studies in Kenya for a better understanding of the nuances of climate adaptation, requiring a range of measures to be adopted and institutions working together. Findings from the study reveal that the most consistent observation among farmers is that eastern Africa is experiencing increased temperature and decreased rainfall across all its agro-ecological zones. In response to their perceived climatic risks, smallholder farmers in the region are using both short-term and long-term strategies, with the former mainly consisting of coping mechanisms against climate chocks. In addition, the adaptation strategies implemented by the farmers are influenced by agro-ecological conditions which shape their farming systems and institutional settings including proximity to a major city and markets. The case studies highlight the importance of collaborative efforts between key local and external stakeholders in supporting adaptation to climate change. Key lessons are drawn from this study for the development of future adaptation programmes.",0.915737836826808,0.23075542424216286,0.10241743359564998,0.5458132965909804,0.04680991635864908,0.026732350109987712,0.07063221955701351
Interceding role of institutional extension services on the livelihood impacts of drought tolerant maize technology adoption in Zimbabwe,"The study investigates whether access to agricultural extension services enhances the well-known positive impact of adopting Drought Tolerant Maize (DTM) technology on livelihood outcomes; maize yield, output per capita, consumption and sales using a representative dataset of smallholder farming households from Zimbabwe. The empirical analysis adopts an instrumental variable regression model that incorporates an endogenous interaction term to capture the intermediary role of institutional extension services. Results reveal that access to agricultural extension services enhances the relationship between DTM adoption and maize yield, output per capita, and consumption but appears to weaken the association between DTM adoption and the amount of maize set aside for sale. In exploring the potential reasons why access to institutional extension services might enhance the DTM adoption-livelihood outcomes relationship, the results suggest mechanisms related to the use of basal fertilizers, use of organic manure, access to agricultural credit, use of certified DTM seed, access to general production and marketing information, weeding frequency and disease control which are more likely to be influenced by access to agricultural extension services. The findings suggest that policies targeted at improving DTM adoption as a climate-smart agricultural technology to improve resilience of smallholder maize farming households to climate variability and change must be complemented by revitalized agriculture extension services. Revitalization of extension services may come through capacity building of extension institutions, and their personnel, improving agricultural extension infrastructure, mobility of extension personnel, and increased financing to such institutions.",0.9662721038882051,0.17295733282517728,0.05624453636382007,0.6857230806575582,0.02596565895419466,0.02304495134621865,0.03521897150513501
Multi-dimensional coping and adaptation strategies of small-scale fishing communities of Bangladesh to climate change induced stressors,"Purpose - Coastal and floodplain areas are on the frontline of climate change in Bangladesh. Small-scale coastal and floodplain fishing communities of the country face a host of cross-scale stressors continually, some induced by climate change, and they have developed coping and adaption strategies based on customary social and experiential learnings. This paper aims to examine the coping and adaptation strategies that small-scale fishing communities undertake in the face of stresses including climate change and variability. Design/methodology/approach - This research takes a nuanced ethnographic-oriented approach based on around two-year-long field study in two coastal and floodplain fishing villages, represented by two distinct ethnic groups. The study adopts direct observational methods to denote the ways small-scale fishing communities address the arrays of stressors to construct and reconstruct their survival and livelihood needs. Findings - It was observed that fishers' coping and adaptation strategies comprise a fluid combination of complex overlapping sets of actions that the households undertake based on their capitals and capabilities, perceptions, socio-cultural embeddedness and experiential learnings from earlier adverse situations. Broadly, these are survival, economic, physiological, social, institutional and religiosity-psychological in nature. Adaptation mechanisms involve some implicit principles or self-provisioning actions that households are compelled to do or choose under given sets of abnormal stresses to reach certain levels of livelihood functions. Originality/value - Based on empirical field research, this paper recognizes small-scale fishers' capability and adaptability in addressing climate change-induced stresses. Policymakers, international development planners, climate scientists and social workers can learn from these grassroots-level coping and adaptation strategies of fishing communities to minimize the adverse effects of climate change and variations.",0.5069743866980846,0.36409826040906446,0.11750603614562462,0.6323029315254503,0.3514011816612605,0.08728515805624566,0.07540142988409633
Farm household level adaptation metrics for agriculture and water sectors,"Purpose - This study aims to provide a methodology for constructing farm household-level adaptation metrics for agriculture and water sectors. The livelihood of farm households is at risk now and in the foreseeable future, as both agriculture and water sectors are vulnerable to climate variability, particularly in developing nations. Adaptation is critical to protect their livelihood. Vulnerable farmers have adopted various adaptation mechanisms to counteract negative impacts of climate variability, though the extent varies temporally and spatially. Design/methodology/approach - It is, therefore, imperative to understand current adaptation practices for successfully implementing them. A few studies have emerged so far in this context, investigating different issues associated with micro-level adaptation strategies related to agriculture and water sectors, e.g. output and cost-effectiveness, and constraints related to farm, household and institutional levels. Findings - While such analysis is critical to enhance micro-level adaptation measures, there is a felt need to formulate adaptation metrics that can investigate the underlying factors in an integrated manner. For empirical assessment, 146 farmers were interviewed from different agro-ecological zones of Tamil Nadu, India, regarding seven adaptation measures, such as micro-irrigation, rainwater harvesting, resistant crops, use of bio-fertilisers, crop insurance, income diversification and community-based efforts. Practical implications - These adaptation measures were evaluated through an Analytical Hierarchy Process using four criteria: effective awareness, economic viability, individual and institutional compatibility and flexibility and independent benefits. Originality/value - The present study provides a methodology to identify barriers that limit implementation of adaptation measures, and enable target-oriented policy measures to promote appropriate adaptation strategies at the local level.",0.8699748830216335,0.19856415967404017,0.1154025461638052,0.427185690617586,0.07736686294807882,0.11195170520663499,0.3575293242746747
Unintended outcomes of farmers' adaptation to climate variability: deforestation and conservation in Calakmul and Maya biosphere reserves,"Minimizing the impact of climate change on farmer livelihoods is crucial, but adaptation efforts may have unintended consequences for ecosystems, with potential impacts on farmers' welfare. Unintended outcomes of climate adaptation strategies have been widely discussed, however, empirical exploration has been neglected. Grounded in scholarship on climate adaptation, environmental governance, social-ecological systems, and land-use change, this paper studies whether farmers' climate adaptation contributes to deforestation or forest conservation. The paper draws on interviews with 353 farmers from 46 communities in Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Mexico and Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala. Farmers in the area of study have implemented adaptation strategies that people around the world have used for centuries, including migration, diversification, savings, and pooling. The findings show that climate adaptation can increase deforestation or support forest conservation depending on the type of adaptation strategy farmers implement. Saving, based on cattle ranching, is a deforestation-driving strategy. The choice of this strategy is influenced by distance to the commercial and administrative center and cash benefits from the forest. Deforestation can have a negative impact on farmers' welfare, as well as harm biodiversity and contribute to increased climate change. Thus, deforestation-driving adaptation strategies may be ineffective. However, diversification, based on off-farm jobs and operating provision shops, is a conservation-driving strategy influenced by distance as well as by family size. Farmers who choose diversification to adapt may contribute to a virtuous circle in which livelihood improvement in the short term leads to enhanced social-ecological resilience in the longer term. The need for farmers to implement adaptation strategies thus represents great risk but also opportunities.",0.8911156111049292,0.24277628292496492,0.11952203060824548,0.4720078194093714,0.03847935699661371,0.018736624998851793,0.01637285638893904
"Coping mechanisms adopted by the livestock dependents of drought prone districts of Bihar, India","Coping mechanisms adopted by the farming community has recently become a subject of increasing importance in climate change research with an objective to reduce the vulnerability of climate sensitive people. The present study was designed to identify and assess the coping mechanisms adopted by the livestock dependents to mitigate the impact of drought on their livestock rearing and livelihood security. A total 240 livestock dependents from three drought prone districts of Bihar were interviewed and an exclusively Drought adaptation Index was developed for this study. The study revealed that 49 adaptation strategies were adopted by the livestock dependents which were further distributed into seven broad categories. Most significant coping mechanisms were feeding of extra crop residues, providing frequent extra clean and fresh feed and water, storage of wheat/ rice straw, change in cropping pattern, feeding and milking during cool hours, kept animal in shadow, extra bathing of cattle, feeding of extra concentrate, selling of animals and reducing herd size. The study also established that adoption of coping mechanism was increased significantly with the increase in degree of drought proneness and herd size was the most significant contributor to the higher level of adoption of coping mechanisms.",0.9170188756627949,0.2381895319687839,0.07819500055145741,0.6229665437672883,0.020776022696913445,0.03251405509281075,0.12099443111448657
Enhancing resilience to climate shocks through farmer innovation: evidence from northern Ghana,"In this paper, we contribute to recent attempts to operationalize the measurement of climate resilience by measuring household resilience to climate shocks and by assessing the role of farmer innovations in enhancing climate resilience. Adapting the Food and Agriculture Organization's resilience tool, we develop a household resilience index using survey data from rural farm households in northern Ghana. The index consists of six components and 23 indicators and was constructed using two indicator-weighting approaches. The proposed resilience index is a simple tool that can be used to quantitatively assess the resilience of households to the incidence of climate shocks and to monitor interventions aimed at building rural household resilience to unpredictable shocks. The results indicate that farm households in the study region are weakly resilient to climate shocks. We also show that farmers go beyond adoption of externally driven technologies to develop their very own innovations, and these innovations contribute significantly to enhancing household resilience to climate shocks. Using propensity score matching method, we found that farmer innovators are about 6% more resilient to climate shocks than non-innovators. This result is robust to alternative weighting approaches and matching algorithms, and also to hidden bias. The paper concludes that policy efforts aiming at enhancing farm households' resilience to climate shocks should consider providing support for farmers' innovations.",0.8162948629279477,0.25192577672326816,0.08431057500756585,0.6106864871731607,0.01713997734655411,0.02476813817199926,0.07779555914460402
Land-users' perceptions and adaptations to climate change in Mexico and Spain: commonalities across cultural and geographical contexts,"Comparing agricultural management practices across scales and in different cultural settings can reveal shared insights into the capacity to adjust and respond to change and uncertainty. Differences make comparisons in environmental risk perceptions and responses particularly interesting and valuable, with obtained similarities being in many ways more interesting than found differences, which might be readily expected in places with remarkable geographical and demographic differences. People's perception of climatic risks and hazards appears to be important to understand the context in which adaptation strategies to climate change emerge. Our intention, rather than compare the two case studies at the local scale, one in Mexico and one in Spain, is to identify existing common mechanisms to perceive climate change and to address adaptation among two very different geographical and cultural contexts. The study aims first to explore people's perceptions of climate change and its outcomes; second to analyse the adaptation measures that they have developed and develop some preliminary ideas about their strategies; and third to consider the capacity of people to cope and adapt endogenously, in terms of the measures that people think that their governments should take to enhance/strengthen them at the local scale.",0.5559179116273957,0.33992354803070723,0.137296082541939,0.33666518099543896,0.15715198995387739,0.08634900774102194,0.2902082066947768
Determinants of crop diversification in rice-dominated Sri Lankan agricultural systems,"Climate-driven changes in water availability in tropical agricultural systems will force many farmers to significantly alter their cultivation practices. In agricultural systems dominated by water-intensive rice cultivation, farmers may need to diversify away from rice to crops that perform better in the new climate. We combine data from interviews and household surveys with Sri Lankan farmers to identify the factors that influence farmers' decisions to diversify away from rice monoculture. Results indicate that many farmers cannot diversify because of the characteristics of their fields, including elevation, soil quality, irrigation infrastructure, and relative position within an irrigation system. As a result, policies that assume all farmers are able to engage in diversification are unlikely to have the desired impact. Of the farmers whose fields can support diversification, poor market access, market instability, limited government support, and relatively high input costs reduce diversification rates. In addition to creating a supportive institutional environment for the cultivation of other field crops, leveraging existing water management institutions to identify and support farmers with fields suitable to diversification could decrease agricultural water demands and increase water access for farmers unable to engage in diversification.",0.9844460298864232,0.13054393096792843,0.0751738075504585,0.5160026926718444,0.018234139730896756,0.014348304037848859,0.1054616373383395
Household and Community Assets and Farmers' Adaptation to Extreme Weather Event: the Case of Drought in China,"Under climate change, rising frequency and serious extreme weather events have challenged agricultural production. Designing appropriate adaptation measures to the extreme weather events require rigorous and empirical analysis. The overall goals of this study are to understand physical adaptation measures taken by farmers and the impacts of household and community assets on farmers' adaptation when they face drought. The analyses are based on a unique data set collected from a household survey in three provinces in China. The survey results show that though not common on annual basis, some farmers did use physical adaptation measures to fight drought. Regression analysis reveals that both household and community assets significantly affect farmers' adaptation behaviors. Improving households' social capital and wealth, communities' network and access to government's anti-drought service can facilitate farmers' adaptation to drought. Results indicate that community's irrigation infrastructure and physical adaptation taken by farmers can substitute each other. Further analysis shows that the households taking adaptation measures have higher crop yields than those without taking these measures. The paper concludes with several policy implications.",0.9310289723422301,0.2760249779113699,0.0697645768666571,0.41367334257577154,0.02036282742427937,0.053539835876079155,0.11755192148953161

Climate-smart agricultural practices and welfare of rural smallholders in Ethiopia: Does planting method matter?,"The purpose of this study is to provide empirical evidence on the impact of a climate-smart agricultural practice (row planting) on the welfare of rural households. Data collected from 260 households in Gubalafto woreda of Amhara region in Ethiopia were analyzed using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and a Semi-parametric Local Instrumental Variable (LIV) version of the generalized Roy model. The results from the PSM model revealed that adoption of row planting technology has a positive and significant impact on per capita consumption and on crop income per hectare. Covariates are well balanced and the impact estimate is insensitive to unobserved selection bias indicating that the estimates are a pure effect of the row planting technology. Marginal benefit of row planting is increasing with higher propensity of the farmer to adopt the climate smart planting technology. Therefore, scaling up the technology will significantly contribute to fanners' resilience against the adverse effects of climate change through enhancing household's income and food security.",0.9267079912218961,0.18678196831170402,0.044703885720640255,0.6597673820761252,0.033092781021468586,0.023539757678152,0.02136602814963575
Understanding Climate Adaptation on Public Lands in the Upper Midwest: Implications for Monitoring and Tracking Progress,"There are limited examples of efforts to systematically monitor and track climate change adaptation progress in the context of natural resource management, despite substantial investments in adaptation initiatives. To better understand the status of adaptation within state natural resource agencies, we utilized and problematized a rational decision-making framework to characterize adaptation at the level of public land managers in the Upper Midwest. We conducted in-depth interviews with 29 biologists and foresters to provide an understanding of managers' experiences with, and perceptions of, climate change impacts, efforts towards planning for climate change, and a full range of actions implemented to address climate change. While the majority of managers identified climate change impacts affecting their region, they expressed significant uncertainty in interpreting those signals. Just under half of managers indicated planning efforts are underway, although most planning is remote from local management. Actions already implemented include both forward-looking measures and those aimed at coping with current impacts. In addition, cross-scale dynamics emerged as an important theme related to the overall adaptation process. The results hold implications for tracking future progress on climate change adaptation. Common definitions or measures of adaptation (e.g., presence of planning documents) may need to be reassessed for applicability at the level of public land managers.",0.14779263620516941,0.3453181798125861,0.2095884681287738,0.19102103099910883,0.11538078888605341,0.2637252675941433,0.155924388951271
"The insight of agricultural adaptation to climate change: a case of rice growers in Eastern Himalaya, India","Adaptation is crucial to curb down the negative impact of climate change particularly on agricultural sector. Hence, a study was conducted to identify the strategies adopted by the cereal growers in Eastern Himalaya region of India and determine the factors affecting them. A total 120 farmers were surveyed from Senapati district in Manipur and East Sikkim district in Sikkim. The widely adopted strategies were the change in transplanting time and change in transplanting as well as harvesting time, which were autonomous, traditional, and taken in response to the scarcity of water. Tobit model has identified that the area under rice cultivation, support received from Village Science Centre, and decline in food availability positively influenced the farmers to adapt to climate change. Multinomial logit model revealed that the female farmers, area under rice cultivation, and decline in rice productivity positively influenced the adoption of the strategies, whereas number of cattle owned, irrigated area, and support from Agricultural Department revealed the negative influence. To sustain farming in hill agriculture, the study recommends the integration of the farmers' knowledge along with scientific measures.

Climate-smart practices for improvement of crop yields in mid-hills of Nepal,"Farming in Nepal mostly represents the hill farming system with the dominance of small-holder farmers. In recent days, farmers in the country are impacted by climate change. Events of surface runoff, landslides, and soil erosions, along with changes in rainfall pattern and intensity have elevated a decline in crop productivity and soil fertility. Considering the situation, a pilot project on Resilient Mountain Village was implemented in Kavrepalanchowk district of Nepal from 2014-2016 with a participatory approach to demonstrate climate-smart practices. These practices include the application of locally prepared bio-fertilizer (named as ""jholmal""), green manuring in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and mulching in bitter-gourd (Momordica charantia L.) to determine crop yields compared to farmers' business as usual practice. The results showed that there was a significant effect of jholmal in rice production during 2015-2016 when compared to farmers' business as usual practice. Likewise, green manuring also showed a significant difference in rice yield compared to farmers' usual practice in 2015-2016. Bitter-gourd yields were significantly higher in mulching treatment compared to the farmers' business as usual practice in 2015 and 2016. Rice yield increased by at least 10.1% and 8.1% while using jholmal and green manuring, respectively, whereas bitter-gourd yield increased by 18.1% with mulching practices. Our findings show that farmers have adopted these practices and minimized the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, thus moving forward to producing safer food using a climate-friendly approach.",0.9713834169096383,0.14195291118327316,0.0633386789705831,0.5052481777679222,0.0276469555687491,0.01680278706067263,0.01774855942433506
Assessing climate-resilient agriculture for smallholders,"This study assesses the effectiveness of climate-resilient agriculture (CRA) practices in terms of cost-benefits, and prioritizes the activities involved. It was carried out in the Udayapur district of Nepal, where the application of CRA practices into vegetable farming has introduced jholmol (a bio-pesticide and nutrient supplement); water conservation technologies; support for formation of farmers' groups; regular technical follow-up; and flow of regular market information through short message services (SMS: that is, text messaging). This study is based on the discussions of five focus groups held with local farmers, and on 300 interviews with participating households in the study area. The results indicate that CRA generates multiple benefits compared to conventional agricultural practices. For instance, the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of CRA practice is 1.81 as compared to 1.02 for conventional farming. In addition, practicing CRA has changed the food habits of farmers, since the proportion of vegetables consumed in their regular meals has increased substantially. Farmers are also engaging in vegetable farming in their leisure time, instead of drifting around their villages. However, CRA practice demands capital NPR. 537,695/ha/year (USD 5220/ha/year) as compared to conventional agricultural practice NPR. 140,171/ha/year (USD 1361/ha/year). Formation of the farmers' group probably promoted dissemination of knowledge on CRA practices, as it facilitated interaction and the exchange of ideas. CRA is, therefore, an integrated approach rather than the simple provision of technology.",0.9489587652908876,0.18217320227957942,0.09022985726936643,0.5,0.027193293228923,0.01648518941524496,0.04208985513398793
Livelihood adaptations to climate variability: insights from farming households in Ghana,"Climate variability poses a significant threat to many sectors of Sub-Saharan Africa's economy. Agriculture is one of the most climate sensitive sectors because of its dependence on rain-fed cultivation. This paper identifies the main adaptation strategies used by farming households in the Sudan savannah and forest-savannah transitional agro-ecological zones of Ghana, in order to reduce the adverse impacts of climate variability on their livelihood activities. It combines questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews and a range of participatory methods. Results show that households employ a range of on- and off-farm adaptation strategies including changing the timing of planting, planting early maturing varieties, diversification of crops, support from family and friends, and changing their diets to manage climate variability. Results reveal that most households use adaptation strategies linked to livelihood diversification to adapt to the increased climate variability seen in recent decades. Most households now engage in multiple non-arable farming livelihood activities in an attempt to avoid destitution because of crop failure linked to climate variability (particularly drought). The findings suggest that policy makers need to formulate more targeted climate adaptation policies and programmes that are linked to enhancing livelihood diversification, as well as establishing communication routes for farming communities to better share their knowledge on successful local climate adaptation strategies.",0.9439208535482888,0.2521372982551637,0.09021710033159068,0.8052646338247662,0.03348091491285914,0.013505151975497337,0.03551663996068207
Smallholder response to environmental change: Impacts of coffee leaf rust in a forest frontier in Mexico,"Coffee agroforestry systems are a promising approach to the challenge of sustaining both biodiversity and livelihoods in tropical landscapes. However, coffee farmers' response to the unrelenting coffee leaf rust (CLR) outbreak may have repercussions for the potential of coffee agroforestry systems to contribute to biodiversity conservation. Adaptations in management practices could affect the extent to which farmers rely on ecological processes vs. external inputs (e.g., agrochemicals) to support production. This study investigates farmers' response to CLR outbreak through a study in a forest frontier in a Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico. We conducted household surveys and fieldwork before the CLR outbreak in 2011-2012 (n = 59), and follow-up surveys after the outbreak in 2016 (n = 48). Before CLR outbreak, farmers were cultivating Arabica coffee varieties in agroforestry systems and generally following agroecological approaches. Most farmers (82%) were certified organic and did not employ synthetic agrochemicals. Farmers (66%) had plans to expand their Arabica coffee agroforests either into forest (35%) or fallow (31%) in response to high farm gate prices. After CLR outbreak, 94% of farmers had CLR-resistant hybrid coffee varieties (HCV) in their possession and were either incorporating them by substituting affected Arabica coffee plants in existing fields, or by establishing new coffee fields with HCV at lower elevations. In attempts to control CLR, farmers (54%) also applied agrochemicals at least once and, to a lesser extent (19%), removed shade trees. Among the farmers (63%) who were planning on expanding coffee production with HCV, more farmers were planning on expanding on fallow (46%) than forest (17%) compared to the period before CLR outbreak (p-value < 0.05). Public and private actors promoted and distributed saplings of HCV and agrochemicals along with technical assistance. The promotion of HCV along with fertilizers may result in a substitution of ecosystem functions with agrochemicals, and the need to acquire seeds and saplings outside of farmers' own resource base and networks. This shift in management strategies generates new instabilities and risks by introducing a new market for HCV about which little is known and by making external agents the holders of productive resources and knowledge.",0.9457429199450511,0.1439958937176217,0.08978704759592814,0.4381164928439537,0.029972538357755416,0.02179275149230164,0.01420530853546408
Influence of institutional access and social capital on adaptation decision: Empirical evidence from hazard-prone rural households in Bangladesh,"An understanding of the factors that shape resource-poor households' heterogeneity in adopting adaptation strategies is crucial in developing adaptation policies. This research examines the determinants of household adaptation choices and the barriers to adaptation. It also focuses on the influence of institutional access and social capital on adaptation choice as a way forward to support and sustain local adaptation process by using the survey data of 380 hazards-prone vulnerable households in Bangladesh. The results reveal that households are implementing adaptation strategies such as diversifying crops, tree plantation (adopted by large and medium farmers), and homestead gardening and migration (adopted by small and landless farmers). Barriers to adaptation are observed heterogeneously among the farming groups where access to credit and lack of information on appropriate adaptation strategies are among the important barriers to adaptation. The model results indicate that the choice of adaptation strategies is significantly influenced by social capital and access to institutions. To support adaptation locally and to enhance vulnerable households' resilience to better cope with riverbank erosion and other climatic change issues, interventions by the government through planned adaptation, such as access to institutions and credit facilities, and a package of technologies through agro-ecological based research are required.

Analysing the potential of plant clinics to boost crop protection in Rwanda through adoption of IPM: the case of maize and maize stem borers,"Maize plays an important role in the livelihoods of rural communities in Rwanda. However, maize yields are threatened by the presence of pests and diseases and a general lack of knowledge and information for their management. In this study we sought to assess if plant clinics are making farmers more aware and knowledgeable of pests and diseases and are indirectly contributing to higher yields. We interviewed 644 farmers across Rwanda, both users and non-users of plant clinics. Propensity score matching was used to match the users and non-users of plant clinics and logistic regression was used to assess a number of factors, including interactions with plant clinics, that affect farmers' adoption of pest management practices. Our analysis shows that users of plant clinics are more aware and knowledgeable in recognizing and handling maize stem borers. Furthermore, users of plant clinics have on average higher yields than non-users and this difference is highly significant (P<0.001). The analysis therefore demonstrates that plant clinics are beneficial to farmers in Rwanda. However, efforts are required to diversify the spectrum of practices that are promoted by plant clinics and by extension and advisory services in Rwanda.",0.9199901973108755,0.22695620543588121,0.10004531206102693,0.433327429970589,0.03880293745368465,0.024289905624902765,0.036090566626505206
Climate change beliefs and forest management in eastern Oregon: implications for individual adaptive capacity,"The management decisions of private landowners affect forest structure and composition, and may impact the resilience of forested regions. In this case study we assessed barriers to both intentional and incidental climate-adaptive forest management among nonindustrial private forest owners in eastern Oregon, USA. In this context, incidental adaptations result from synergies between climate-adaptive forest management and actions motivated by goals such as wildfire mitigation, which landowners may prioritize regardless of concerns about climate change. Through semistructured interviews we used qualitative analyses to identify barriers to adaptation, including subjective (cognitive and experiential) and structural barriers (social, political, and economic) by comparing individual cases. Overall, we found that intentional climate change adaptation had low salience among participants, though a large majority of forest owners were active managers motivated by other goals, contributing to widespread incidental adaptation. We found that nonindustrial private forest owners who engaged in or considered intentional climate adaptation actions generally believed that anthropogenic climate change is occurring. Many respondents perceived local environmental change, notably reduced snowpack, but this was not associated with adaptive actions or intentions. The few participants who considered or implemented intentional climate adaptation actions generally had written forest management plans containing both forest inventories and specific management goals. Improving access to resources for forest management planning may enhance fire- and climate-smart forest management by facilitating scenario visioning and formalizing intentions. Although climate change beliefs were subjective barriers to intentional climate adaptation, many of the same structural barriers limited intentional and incidental adaptation. Place-based education, reliable funding mechanisms, and cooperative approaches among landowners may enhance adaptive capacity and promote the resilience of these nonindustrial private forestlands.",0.3803693783896054,0.3000672990366801,0.4756008474900244,0.13505009991693648,0.03822497649464538,0.05043158846984595,0.05176936531697506
"The potential of agroforestry as an adaptation strategy to mitigate the impacts of climate change: A case study of Kiine Community, Kenya","Nyaruai MA, Musingi JK, Wambua BN. 2018. The potential of agroforestry as an adaptation strategy to mitigate the impacts of climate change: A case study of Kiine Community, Kenya. Nusantara Bioscience 10: 170-177. This study has a purpose of evaluating the agroforestry potent as a conformation policy to the effects of climate change in the location of the study. One hundred farmers were used as study sample in collecting data with stratified sampling technique. To achieve data from individual farmers, both arranged and disarranged questionnaires were used. The study utilized questionnaires and observation timetable to collect data from individual farmers associated with the study objectives. The study found out that more preferable practices in agroforestry were planting the trees and shrubs as windbreakers, riparian forest buffers, silvopasture, and boundary planting while the less preferable practices were forest farming, alley cropping, and woodlots. It also found that the coaching to identify both indigenous and exotic agroforestry tree species is needed. In particular, 94% and 90% of the respondents got a feeling that the coaching on agroforestry practices and incorporation of exotic species is needed very much. The reason is that the feeling felt by respondents could give contribution to shortening the prolonged production time of trees on farm. On the contrary, 90% of the respondents are confident that agroforestry can increase catchment yield in rivers and streams, ameliorate the micro-climate, increase wood production as well as increase livestock health and products. The result showed that agroforestry has a direct link in increasing subsistence of people in the study area. Food (fruits), fodder, fuelwood, medicinal substances, gums, tannins, essential oils, fibers and waxes are the examples of agroforestry products sold by the surrounding farmers. The money will be used to provide second-tier facilities such as paying the tuition for their children or even getting healthcare facilities. The result shows that agroforestry is a method in agricultural production which can decrease the effects of human activities and climate change on the local environment. Agroforestry can increase the endurance of agricultural outturn to contemporary climate variance as well as prolonged climate change by means of the utilization of trees for intensification, diversification and supporting of farming systems.",0.9551284910238933,0.22538282484905645,0.10546282274686125,0.5297196525835466,0.023447877558823348,0.013259355934232308,0.012463407807500182
Understanding Farmers' Perceptions and Adaptations to Precipitation and Temperature Variability: Evidence from Northern Iran,"Precipitation and temperature variability present significant agricultural risks worldwide. Northern Iran's agriculture mainly depends on paddy fields, which are directly affected by precipitation and temperature variability. The main aim of this study is to explore farmers' attitudes towards precipitation and temperature variability and their adaptation strategies in paddy fields in a typical agricultural province in northern Iran. Primary survey data were collected from a sample of 382 paddy farmers of Rasht County in Guilan Province. Data have been analyzed using both summary statistics and bivariate analysis (Pearson, Spearman, and Eta correlation coefficients). Empirical findings reveal that most paddy farmers had experienced precipitation and temperature variability and were taking measures to reduce its negative impacts on their crops. Results also indicate that farm size and household income influence farmers' perception to precipitation and temperature variability, while availability of water resources also influence farmers' adaptation decisions.",0.9659459537264229,0.20539415535424263,0.0907884003207754,0.47786021464727624,0.02972514864806044,0.021329655145176048,0.10920596390360342
Adaptation to climate change and factors affecting it in Assam,"Adapting to the climate changes has emerged as a solution to address the impacts of climate change that are already evident in some regions. The present paper aims to investigate what are the adaptations practices that farmers use to minimise the effect of climate change and to identify the main Actors affecting their choice to adapt. Interviewing 230 farmers from three agro-climatic zones of Assam, the results depict that the adaptation choices mostly practiced are found to be more fertiliser usage, varietal adjustments, new crop and adjustment of planting dates. Probit regression model shows that among the main determinants affecting adaptation choices the most important are income, extension activity and credit availability. © 2017 Indian Society of Agricultural Economics.

"Climate Change and Variability in Semiarid Palapye, Eastern Botswana: An Assessment from Smallholder Farmers' Perspective","Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and variability in semiarid contexts. Despite the limited adaptation options often used and the largely subsistence agriculture practiced, studies have shown that smallholders have accumulated local knowledge about changes in climatic conditions. Farmers with field experience and an extensive stay in three sites in Palapye, eastern Botswana, were interviewed. This study related farmers' perceptions of changes in climate with results from analysis of climate data. Major changes perceived are a reduction in rainfall amount, rising temperature, and increasing frequency of drought conditions. Perceived reduction in rainfall amount is confirmed by analysis results as variability in rainfall amount is high throughout the series. Rainfall was poorly distributed and below average at the beginning of the cropping seasons for four years between 2013 and 2017. For 1990, 2003, and 2012, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) was -1.77 (severe drought), -1.37 (moderate drought), and -2.32 (extreme drought), respectively. To minimize impacts on crop production, farmers simultaneously planted different crops based on the perception that climatic impacts on different crops vary and favored crops perceived as drought resistant. Livestock farmers supplemented with livestock feeds, reduced herd size, and moved livestock to areas with better forage. Off-farm incomes from selling products harvested from the wild are important to farmers as a coping strategy, particularly when rain fails. Some female farmers brewed and sold alcohol made locally from sorghum. That local knowledge and perceptions exist and are used by smallholder farmers to adapt to climate change and variability is suggested. Engaging with local knowledge systems is an imperative for climate change policy making.",0.9957219859582732,0.1287708402766926,0.06108704187979479,0.5647170803322058,0.0049054787482600785,0.005792617221999547,0.02494572149206348
Farm households' perception on climate change and adaptation practices A case from mountain district of Nepal,"Purpose - This paper aims to assess the farming community's perception on important parameters of climate change and identify major practices and technologies adopted to mitigate the impacts of climate change and their determinants in mountain district of Nepal. Being an agrarian economy and dependent on monsoon rain, the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity and production has been experienced. Different adaptation strategies have been adopted by the communities to cope with the consequences of climate change. Design/methodology/approach - Four village development committees (VDCs) situated in the buffer zone of Langtang National Park of Rasuwa district representing rice, wheat, maize and potato production area was purposively selected for this study. A two-stage sampling technique was adopted for data and information collection. Thirty households from each VDC were randomly selected. Data on the socio-economic and climate change perception were collected using structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression technique was used to identify the determinants of climate change adaptation technologies and practices. Findings - The farmers' decisions whether to adopt climate change adaptation technologies are governed by the size of landholding, perceived threat of climate change to food security, education level and gender of the interviewee, perception on the increased incidence of droughts during rainy season and income received from the off-farm sources. In a community where agricultural activity is the dominant means of living, adaptive strategies help to increase the capacity of a farming system to survive external shocks and cope with the consequences. Originality/value - The assessment of farm-level adaptation strategies and factors influencing their adoption decision is important to formulate policies and design programs. This will also help to recognize adaptation as a tool for managing a variety of risks associated with climate change in agricultural sector.",0.9435123386351192,0.2302878491653547,0.07345751736340687,0.5711040081356591,0.02445638807888493,0.01607650310162746,0.03173366534822958
"Determinants of adaptation choices to climate change by sheep and goat farmers in Northern Ethiopia: the case of Southern and Central Tigray, Ethiopia","The livestock sector serves as a foremost source of revenue for rural people, particularly in many developing countries. Among the livestock species, sheep and goats are the main source of livelihood for rural people in Ethiopia; they can quickly multiply, resilient and are easily convertible to cash to meet financial needs of the rural producers. The multiple contributions of sheep and goat and other livestock to rural farmers are however being challenged by climate change and variability. Farmers are responding to the impacts of climate change by adopting different mechanisms, where choices are largely dependent on many factors. This study, therefore, aims to analyze the determinants of choices of adaptation practices to climate change that causes scarcity of feed, heat stress, shortage of water and pasture on sheep and goat production. The study used 318 sample households drawn from potential livestock producing districts representing 3 agro-ecological settings. Data was analyzed using simple descriptive statistical tools, a multivariate probit model and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Most of the respondents (98.6 %) noted that climate is changing. Respondents' perception is that climate change is expressed through increased temperature (88 %) and decline in rainfall (73 %) over the last 10 years. The most commonly used adaptation strategy was marketing during forage shock (96.5 %), followed by home feeding (89.6 %). The estimation from the multivariate probit model showed that access to information, farming experience, number of households in one village, distance to main market, income of household, and agro-ecological settings influenced farmers' adaptation choices to climate change. Furthermore, OLS revealed that the adaptation strategies had positive influence on the household income.",0.9633145170388598,0.21506304797890657,0.09664894349060228,0.6640569250850575,0.02676963020182395,0.009578131451172821,0.01781186187255755
"What drives farmers to adopt farm-level adaptation practices to climate extremes: Empirical evidence from Odisha, India","Odisha is frequently affected by climate extremes such as cyclones and floods. In response, farmers take various adaptation measures to minimise the negative economic impact of these extreme events. The present study analyses the current adaptation strategies of the farm households and the inputs from the analysis can potentially help the future policies aimed at scaling up adaptation strategies to be more effective. A survey of 285 farm households was conducted in three cyclone- and flood-prone districts of Odisha. The study identifies various farm-level adaptation measures and their determinants. The determinants were agricultural extension, access to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, received crop loss compensation and access to informal credit. It is concluded that the adaptation policy and investment decisions should take into account these determinants in order to enhance the adaptive capacity of the rural farmers in the cyclone- and flood-prone regions of the state.

Strategies for maize production facing the impacts of climate change,"In Mexico, the maize is a resource of profound social, cultural and feeding importance, the maize production rules the family and community peasant traditional livelihoods en crisis, increased by the climate change. This study shows how the peasants in Ahuihuiyuco, a rural community in the Centro Region of Guerrero State, Mexico, deal with the climate change and the uncertainty that affects the maize production. For this research was applied qualitative methodology tools, such as, participant observation, walking through the fields, 17 deep interviews and three group interviews, in addition, a socioeconomic survey by the scanning technique applied to 212 families The findings evidence the centrality of the maize for the peasant families with small parcels, located in hillsides, that use native seeds and combine traditional and modern techniques to face increasing temperature, rain changes rainfed, drought, wind and floods; whose explanations vary according to gender and schooling. In conclusion, the peasant families respond with adaptive strategies and practices accompanied of small modifications in every agricultural cycle; these strategies are an efficient responses to the currently environment conditions, such as changing of planting date, acriollar, manure application, use short-cycle seeds, activities to decrease erosion and rituals to request and gratefulness to the rain and good harvest, according to the peasant experience and knowledge.",0.8226799691538427,0.30133719485669147,0.10440887699505769,0.47895702954401503,0.04538834407678274,0.03488640267412715,0.08202772632909926
"Climate Variability and Rural Livelihoods: How Households Perceive and Adapt to Climatic Shocks in the Okavango Delta, Botswana","Climate variability and change have adverse effects on agricultural production and other livelihood strategies of the rural households. The paper hypothesizes that rural households naturally devise means of overcoming the challenges currently posed by climate variability. The research article addresses the question of how rural households apply local knowledge of weather forecasting in adapting to climate variability in the Okavango Delta. It specifically probes, among others, the extent to which climate variability has affected agricultural production over the last 10 years in the area. A multistage sampling procedure was used to select a total of 592 households from eight rural communities. Key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and a stakeholder workshop were used to obtain demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and climatic information. Households used both natural animate and inanimate indicators to predict the weather. To enhance household adaptation to climatic events, indigenous knowledge weather forecasters (ethnometeorologists) engaged in discussions with community members on their observation and interpretation of local weather conditions. Households devised adaptation strategies including the selection and preservation of drought-resistant, early maturing seeds, and shift in farming calendars to overcome the vagaries of weather patterns. Local and farming communities had a favorable perception about the accuracy of indigenous knowledge in weather forecasting (ethnometeorology) and therefore continue to utilize this knowledge system in weather forecasting. Most households perceived that change in weather patterns had a direct relationship with the decline in agricultural outputs over the last 10 years. Households' experiential knowledge and ability to quantify their losses in farm yields as a result of climate-related problems provide an important insight for policy makers on how to address the impact of climate variability in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, and in similar social ecological contexts.",0.9275876443720885,0.3956713160143071,0.08271591579067515,0.6700118201942968,0.03018068795277467,0.012464933704137277,0.07491882313513185
Local perceptions of rangeland degradation and climate change in the pastoral society of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,"Rangelands provide several valuable ecological services and provide for the livelihoods of local herders on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). However, rangelands are being degraded due to overgrazing, policy changes and climate change. In this context, a survey was conducted in Zhuaxixiulong township of Gansu Province, China to examine the rangeland management systems and identify problems herders are facing in terms of livestock production and livelihoods using a Participatory Rural Appraisal approach. The results indicated that local herders perceived recent trends in rangeland degradation, climatic change, and political changes, and had developed management practices to adapt to these changes, such as adjusting transhumance patterns, cooperating with local institutions and adopting more collective actions in production practices. This study suggests that, to promote a sustainable rangeland management system in the QTP, policy-makers should recognise indigenous knowledge systems of grazing practices and rangeland management, as well as the need for more advanced technical methods. More attention should be paid to recent changes in climate, social transformations and economic changes to enhance the viability of such a pastoral society. To ensure the sustainability of the social-ecological system, there is a need to strengthen public participation and cooperation with all types of institutions to formulate appropriate policies and improve public services.",0.7999043380362029,0.3317225808987383,0.15906654698844072,0.362964046105521,0.03416134825906023,0.02491924888847673,0.050502559658559786
"Drought Adaptation in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China: Actions, Planning, Pathways and Barriers","The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NX region) of Northwestern China is threatened by increased meteorological drought induced by climate change (CC) and constraints on water supply from the Yellow River. Thus, the NX region is representative of attempts to adapt to CC and variability in China's arid regions. Field visits, a questionnaire and in situ inspections were conducted in 2012-2014 to understand people's perception and awareness of drought and its impact, particularly with respect to adaptation strategies. We mainly focused on drought adaptation actions and planning implemented at the government level under the double pressures of drought and allocation. We described a suitable adaptation pathway for socio-economic sustainable development and discussed existing adaptation barriers. Construction of modern efficient water-saving agriculture lies at the core of drought adaptation, with socio-economic sustainable development being the ultimate goal. To achieve this, policies and institutional, engineering, technological, structural and social initiatives and measures-classified into macro adaptation strategies and specific coping measures-are implemented. Adaptation often encounters obstacles, e.g., policy issues from household contract responsibility systems, funding difficulties of low-income farmers, traditional behavioral habits and low education and literacy levels among farmers. The adaptation pathway involves the construction of modern efficient water-saving agriculture. Agricultural water savings are then transferred to developed industries, which back-feed socio-economic sustainable development in the NX region.",0.7797629761273582,0.254428751435109,0.12276159961307433,0.33314593077006355,0.0311445544050762,0.10965771951201636,0.4178728014075923
Herders' Perceptions of and Responses to Climate Change in Northern Pakistan,"Migratory pastoralism is an adaptation to a harsh and unstable environment, and pastoral herders have traditionally adapted to environmental and climatic change by building on their in-depth knowledge of this environment. In the Hindu Kush Himalayan region, and particularly in the arid and semiarid areas of northern Pakistan, pastoralism, the main livelihood, is vulnerable to climate change. Little detailed information is available about climate trends and impacts in remote mountain regions; herders' perceptions of climate change can provide the information needed by policy makers to address problems and make decisions on adaptive strategies in high pastoral areas. A survey was conducted in Gilgit-Baltistan province of Pakistan to assess herders' perceptions of, and adaptation strategies to climate change. Herders' perceptions were gathered in individual interviews and focus group discussions. The herders perceived a change in climate over the past 10-15 years with longer and more intense droughts in summer, more frequent and heavier snowfall in winter, and prolonged summers and relatively shorter winters. These perceptions were validated by published scientific evidence. The herders considered that the change in climate had directly impacted pastures and then livestock by changing vegetation composition and reducing forage yield. They had adopted some adaptive strategies in response to the change such as altering the migration pattern and diversifying livelihoods. The findings show that the herder communities have practical lessons and indigenous knowledge related to rangeland management and adaptation to climate change that should be shared with the scientific community and integrated into development planning.",0.7929366401057661,0.3155046232922836,0.10650966388755964,0.5,0.054506890089600926,0.03281617991536642,0.035700751651237095
Buffer capacity: capturing a dimension of resilience to climate change in African smallholder agriculture,"Building resilience to climate change in agricultural production can ensure the functioning of agricultural-based livelihoods and reduce their vulnerability to climate change impacts. This paper thus explores how buffer capacity, a characteristic feature of resilience, can be conceptualised and used for assessing the resilience of smallholder agriculture to climate change. It uses the case of conservation agriculture farmers in a Kenyan region and examines how their practices contribute to buffer capacity. Surveys were used to collect data from 41 purposely selected conservation agriculture farmers in the Laikipia region of Kenya. Besides descriptive statistics, factor analysis was used to identify the key dimensions that characterise buffer capacity in the study context. The cluster of practices characterising buffer capacity in conservation agriculture include soil protection, adapted crops, intensification/irrigation, mechanisation and livelihood diversification. Various conservation practices increase buffer capacity, evaluated by farmers in economic, social, ecological and other dimensions. Through conservation agriculture, most farmers improved their productivity and incomes despite drought, improved their environment and social relations. Better-off farmers also reduced their need for labour, but this resulted in lesser income-earning opportunities for the poorer farmers, thus reducing the buffer capacity and resilience of the latter.",0.9750475803491292,0.20883445843963502,0.10479876559472577,0.5375562502367514,0.02561223932283366,0.011555138694521743,0.02936456357745023
"Knowledge, Risk Attitudes and Perceptions on Extreme Weather Events of Smallholder Farmers in Ligao City, Albay, Bicol, Philippines","Smallholder farmers in the Philippines, whose survival and livelihood largely depend on the environment, constantly face risks and bear the impacts of the changing climate. This paper explored how climate change knowledge as well as attitudes and perceptions to risk of smallholder farmers from upland, lowland and coastal ecosystems influence the manner on which they respond and cope with extreme events. Guided by the Adaptation Policy Framework, a questionnaire was developed and administered to 313 smallholder farmers to determine the kind of information that farmers have and how they respond to climate risks towards enhanced adaptive capacity. Seventy-nine percent of respondents lack basic knowledge on climate change. Majority (79%) of respondents recognized that they are exposed to extreme weather risks and perceived climate as a major farming risk. However, availability and access to capital (not climate change) is the biggest perceived threat. Sixty-nine percent of respondents are risk-neutral while farmers who live in less risk-prone areas tend to be risk-takers. Based on correlation, attitudes on risk are influenced by exposure, economic factors and availability of resources. This paper recommends a more targeted climate change information dissemination and customized trainings that enhance capacity, improve livelihood choices and conserve the natural resources.",0.8631367627448017,0.25033467022264916,0.07418836237087333,0.42355719298970135,0.055369233208599385,0.02982588502740712,0.05785654963625601
"Sustainability analysis of observed climate change adaptation strategies in maize farming in Benin, West Africa","The aim of this article was to analyse possible relationships between observed climate change adaptations as developed by farmers and the sustainability level of their production systems. The sustainability levels were measured through a participatory indicators-based approach. A tri-variate Tobit regression model including the observed climate change adaptations as explanatory variables was specified to analyse the main drivers of the measured sustainability levels. Data collection was conducted by survey methods on 336 maize producers randomly sampled and interviewed based on a questionnaire in North Benin. The results highlighted that farmers' socio-economic characteristics such as contact with extension services, organization membership, access to credit, farm size and observed climate change adaptations such as on-farm diversification, land use changes and other adaptations were found to be the major driving forces underlying the sustainability level of maize farming systems. Among the observed climate change adaptations, on-farm diversification and land use change strategies were found to be sustainable options, whereas other adaptations such as change of activity (e.g. on-farm to off-farm activity), migration to another agro-ecological zone, prayers and access to credit appeared to be unsustainable options.",0.944671562516216,0.19973190407061617,0.12128727307326799,0.5,0.03148522025496054,0.01396410420117075,0.024972300284460076
Farm-level cost of adaptation and expected cost of uncertainty associated with climate change impacts in major river basins in India,"Purpose - Researchers and policymakers are figuring out the adaptation technologies to cope with the changing climate. Adaptation strategies for crop production followed by the farmers at selected study locations had ranged from 6-30 per cent only, and this was mainly due to lack of awareness about the actual cost associated with adaptation and non-adaptation of these strategies. Design/methodology/approach - Hence, this study aims to address the cost of adaptation for rice using joint probability distribution of rainfall and crop prices. Findings - Cost of adaptation varied from INR2,389 to 4,395/ha for System of Rice Intensification (SRI); INR646 to 1,121/ha for alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and INR8,144 to 8,677/ha for well irrigation (WI), whereas expected cost for not using these technologies has ranged from INR6,976 to 9,172/ha for SRI; INR4,123 7,764/ha for AWD and INR10,825 to 17,270/ha for WI. Hence, promotion of the adaptation technologies itself will minimize the income losses to the farmers. Research limitations/implications - Even though, there are many ways for farmers (other than technology), to adapt to climate change (such as out-migration to cities, selling farm assets, focus on children's education, etc.), this report, given the framework of the major research study undertaken, addresses only farm-level adaptation of the technologies to enhance farm income. Originality/value - Public-private partnership in providing the technologies at cheaper costs, capacity building in handling the technologies and creating awareness about the technologies to minimize the expected cost of adaptation are suggested to improve the adoption level.",0.8791744308083299,0.2560937997857675,0.07168396942165045,0.4055777082902546,0.042820332054276905,0.08424741826902214,0.042240446491037524
Actor-specific risk perceptions and strategies for resilience building in different food systems in Kenya and Bolivia,"Food system sustainability depends, among other aspects, on the resilience of different components of food systems. By resilience, we mean the ability of a food system to withstand stress and shocks, recover, and adapt to change. In this study, we examined the resilience of food systems, firstly, by compiling the risks perceived by different food system actors in the Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia, and the northwestern Mount Kenya Region, Kenyatwo regions that are important to their respective national food supply. Secondly, we evaluated whether and under what circumstances these perceptions translate into adaptive or preventive strategies that benefit food system resilience. Among all actors, the most frequently perceived risks relate to production levels. Further, the many (sometimes contradictory) perceptions of risk and uncertainty among different actor groups do not necessarily translate into adaptation strategies. Reasons for this include structural factors as well as the risk perception paradox, particularly regarding preventive strategies. However, we also observed many implicit strategies illustrating how different actors develop responses within their possibilities. However, most such strategies were insufficient to mitigate, much less to adapt to, the perceived risks. To build resilience, existing innovative policies need to be enforced in both countries. These include disaster risk reduction programs and programs to reduce the vulnerability of marginalized groups who are crucial to food systems, such as smallholder farmers, pastoralists, and food workers.",0.8467808065106582,0.2980866762653278,0.11345432691634673,0.3835983498976487,0.04073180098066347,0.039061641842009026,0.06105634692549409
Farmer-participatory evaluation of mechanized dry direct-seeding technology for rice in northeastern Thailand,"Rice technologies that are designed to reduce risks due to climate variations, improve productivity, or overcome labor scarcity are important in tropical Asia. The objective of this study was to evaluate mechanized options for dry direct-seeding of rice in terms of the productivity and production costs in rainfed lowlands. In a series of on-farm research trials over 3 years in Ubon Ratchathani province, Thailand, we compared seeding by seed drills mounted on two-wheel tractors with manual broadcast seeding. Demonstration trials of seed drills and site-specific nutrient management in 2017 with 11 of 26 participating farmers produced 2.50 t ha(-1) of grain yield, but unexpected heavy storms forced the other 15 farmers to switch from dry to wet direct-seeding or manual transplanting. The seed drills produced 32% higher grain yield than manual broadcast seeding (3.3 vs. 2.5 t ha(-1)) in 2014, and 14-24% higher yield (3.3-3.6 vs. 2.9 t ha(-1)) in 2015. Mechanized seeding enabled seeding rate reduction by 50% in 2014 and by 52-61% in 2015, resulting in lower production costs than with manual seeding. Our results suggest that mechanized dry direct-seeding of rice with improved nutrient management can enhance farmer livelihoods in rainfed environments in northeastern Thailand. This approach can significantly reduce production costs compared with manual transplanting, while maintaining or increasing productivity compared with conventional manual broadcast seeding.",0.8381385173177098,0.2394187584394872,0.11184468470307511,0.36375766620736516,0.044678580133880735,0.044262285068766984,0.04135513943402252
"Farmers' Perceptions of Climate Variability and Factors Influencing Adaptation: Evidence from Anhui and Jiangsu, China","Impacts of climate variability and climate change are on the rise in China posing great threat to agriculture and rural livelihoods. Consequently, China is undertaking research to find solutions of confronting climate change and variability. However, most studies of climate change and variability in China largely fail to address farmers' perceptions of climate variability and adaptation. Yet, without an understanding of farmers' perceptions, strategies are unlikely to be effective. We conducted questionnaire surveys of farmers in two farming regions, Yifeng, Jiangsu and Qinxi, Anhui achieving 280 and 293 responses, respectively. Additionally, we used climatological data to corroborate the farmers' perceptions of climate variability. We found that farmers' were aware of climate variability such that were consistent with climate records. However, perceived impacts of climate variability differed between the two regions and were influenced by farmers' characteristics. In addition, the vast majorities of farmers were yet to make adjustments in their farming practices as a result of numerous challenges. These challenges included socioeconomic and socio-cultural barriers. Results of logit modeling showed that farmers are more likely to adapt to climate variability if contact with extension services, frequency of seeking information, household heads' education, and climate variability perceptions are improved. These results suggest the need for policy makers to understand farmers' perceptions of climate variability and change in order to formulate policies that foster adaptation, and ultimately protect China's agricultural assets.",0.9833947186479434,0.1353354847163793,0.055909575891962396,0.5778262517154223,0.02011263777299524,0.006575422188725184,0.008887251383723118
"Vulnerability to Cumulative Hazards: Coping with the Coffee Leaf Rust Outbreak, Drought, and Food Insecurity in Nicaragua","Recurrent food insecurity in the highlands of Central America has been exacerbated by the recent convergence of a coffee leaf rust outbreak that began defoliating crops in 2011 and a drought that started in 2014. In the context of these multiple challenges, this paper explores how seasonal hunger is related to smallholder organizational affiliation, farm and farmer characteristics, and post-hazard household-level coping strategies. The study integrates qualitative research, hydro-climatic data analysis, and a survey of 368 households completed in 2014. A number of household capacities correlate significantly with shorter periods of seasonal hunger: households with larger farms, with off-farm employment, and that produce more than half of their food, maintain more fruit trees, and harvest more coffee reported fewer lean months. We find evidence consistent with path dependence in how households cope with a sequence of environmental hazards, as the reported use of less preferred coping responses to past events (e.g., Hurricane Mitch and the 2009 drought) tended to correlate with their continued use after subsequent hazards. A comparison of coping responses of households affiliated with a farmer-to-farmer institution promoting subsistence-oriented production with those affiliated with cooperatives prioritizing sustainable coffee exports shows that farmer institutions were not strongly correlated with the number of lean months or coping mechanisms.

Climate change as a motivating factor for farm-adjustments: Rethinking the link,"In order to design effective adaptation policies for the agricultural sector, it is important to understand what adjustments farmers actually make in order to cope with climate change. Many studies have compiled lists of such adjustments, especially in the developing country context. There is reason to believe, however, that such studies have suffered from particularly two types of methodological flaws, with the result of over-attributing the importance of climate change, relative to other factors leading farmers to alter their behavior. Firstly, studies in the past often do not consider non-climatic drivers in their analysis and their style of enquiry is also prone to response bias, particularly social desirability bias. In this study, we introduced a new methodological approach that addresses these potential flaws. We applied this new method side-by-side with the more established ones, in a household survey undertaken in Ethiopia. Our new method reveals a list of climate adaptations that is somewhat shorter than previous studies have found. We found that in the study area, crop switching, crop diversification and changing planting date are the adjustments that are primarily motivated by climate change than other drivers. The commonly used approach in studies in the past, the direct enquiry method, identified fertilizer application as the most important adaptation response. Other methods including our suggested new approach, however, indicate that this and other farm-level adjustments, while compatible with climate change, have actually very little to do with it, and instead are primarily motivated by new market and technological opportunities. Our findings could allow for more effective and efficient sets of policies to help farmers best adjust to new threats and opportunities.",0.8332708355557643,0.2716231166757512,0.09561681698180069,0.37652165746520777,0.05276112705961183,0.043950471103037875,0.07334846421240576
"Conservation Agriculture Among Farmers in Kalomo, Zambia: Potential for Productivity Under Climate Change","Conservation agriculture (CA) is a climate change adaptation measure being promoted for small-scale farmers in Zambia. CA is touted as a sustainable adaptation practice that can improve productivity in marginal farming areas. This chapter presents a study that analyzed CA practices in Kalomo District, Zambia, i.e., practices applied and associated challenges in management and implementation, from the perspective of agricultural extension workers and organizations promoting CA in the district. Results showed that farmers in Kalomo District do not apply all CA principles, owing to a number of limitations that range from governmental interventions, cultural beliefs, and poor access to extension services. These factors are likely to affect productivity and expose farmers to climate change and will need to be addressed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Adaptive irrigation measures in response to extreme weather events: empirical evidence from the North China plain,"Growing evidence indicates that climate change will exacerbate the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, particularly drought. The North China plain is an important agricultural production region that is subject to a significant shortage of water and is often hit by extreme weather events, particularly drought. Therefore, this study aims to examine how farmers in the North China plain take adaptive irrigation measures in response to drought, the determinants, and the effectiveness of their responses. The results show that, when confronted by severe drought, farmers change their irrigation practices by enhancing the intensity and increasing the efficiency of the irrigation to mitigate the negative effects of such drought. Factors such as the local irrigation infrastructure; provision of physical, financial, and technical policy support; and early-warning information services are of significant help to farmers in taking adaptive measures. Further analysis shows that such adaptive response significantly mitigates yield loss and reduces the risk of crop failure. The paper concludes with some policy implications.",0.9366564958781243,0.20412259161723686,0.04212710674024101,0.22799531195171083,0.022982798387712288,0.039122358373408904,0.12158874014177702
The relative importance of subjective and structural factors for individual adaptation to climate change by forest owners in Sweden,"A growing body of literature argues that subjective factors can more accurately explain individual adaptation to climate change than objective measurers of adaptive capacity. Recent studies have shown that personal belief in climate change and affect are much better in explaining climate awareness and action than income, education or gender. This study focuses on the process of individual adaptation to climate change. It assesses and compares the influence of cognitive, experiential and structural factors on individuals' views and intentions regarding climate change adaptation. Data from this study comes from a survey with 836 forest owners in Sweden. Ordinal and binary logistic regression was used to test hypotheses about the different factors. Results show that cognitive factors-namely personal level of trust in climate science, belief in the salience of climate change and risk assessment-are the only statistically significant factors that can directly explain individuals' intention to adapt to climate change and their sense of urgency. Findings also suggest that structural or socio-demographic factors do not have a statistically significant influence on adaptation decision-making among Swedish forest owners. The study also offers valuable insights for communication interventions to promote adaptation. Findings strongly suggest that communication interventions should focus more strongly on building trust and addressing stakeholders' individual needs and experiences.",0.5493427578680233,0.2822636176660296,0.13221218448950836,0.2137884697822246,0.0904783675104012,0.0758519169217521,0.12398490588996097
Seaweed (Mwani) farming as anâ adaptation strategy to impacts of climate change and variability in Zanzibar,"This study aimed at identifying climatic factors affecting seaweed (Mwani) farming, its associated impacts and adaptation strategies employed by seaweed farmers to cope with the impacts of climate variability and change along the coast of Unguja Island. The study was carried out in four coastal villages of the Island. The villages were chosen because a majority of communities were engaged in the production of Mwani. Household surveys were conducted to collect quantitative data, whereas FGDs and observation were employed to collect qualitative information. A total of 476 households engaged in seaweed farming were used as a sampling frame in the study, where 25% of them (119 households) were randomly selected to participate in the interviews. Results reveal that Mwani production has been widely practised by women (92.4%) and mostly by married people (87.2%). The labour force for seaweed farming fell within the age group 31–49Â years (60.3%). About 77.6% and 70% of the respondents were specific Mwani producers and literate, respectively. Despite the challenges Mwani production was the most popular alternative livelihood performed by many rural populations in Zanzibar. Seaweed farmers perceived that seaweed growing in Unguja had been affected by changes in climate factors and non-climatic stressors over the last 20Â years. Climatic variables that have affected seaweed included increasing surface water temperatures, wind speed, sea waves, irregular rainfall patterns and salinity. Mwani production had generally declined over the last 5 years. Despite a number of strategies taken by Mwani growers to cope and adapt to the impact of changing climate, new research is needed to develop new adaptation technologies that will help farmers to counteract the effect of desiccation and associated diseases aggravated by climatic variables in the field. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",0.9330471692015527,0.25113418039457674,0.08623773239760013,0.6078872852083641,0.041145445279044075,0.021537726514942596,0.04789187479297955
"Impact of Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) Practices on Cotton Production and Livelihood of Farmers in Punjab, Pakistan","Cotton is the second largest crop of Pakistan in terms of area after wheat and is being suffered by multiple shocks over the time due to conventional agricultural management practices, climate change, and market failures. Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) was introduced by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) in 2010, as an innovative cleaner production alternative to conventional farming that aimed at increasing the efficiency of natural resources, resilience, and productivity of agricultural production system, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The adverse effects of climate change on cotton production at the farm and regional level can be minimized by using CSA practices and technologies. The present study investigated the financial performance and explored the impact of CSA through sustainable water use management on cotton production in Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) irrigation system of Punjab, Pakistan by using Cobb-Douglas production function. The adopters of CSA in cotton cultivation were identified by conducting six focus group discussions. Data were collected through well-structured questionnaire from 133 adopters of CSA and 65 conventional cotton growers for the cropping season 2016-2017. It was found that water-smart (raising crops on bed, laser land levelling, conjunctive use of water and drainage management), energy-smart (minimum tillage), carbon-smart (less use of chemicals) and knowledge-smart (crop rotation and improved varieties i.e., tolerant to drought, flood and heat/cold stresses) practices and technologies of CSA were adopted by the cotton farmers in the study area. Most of the farmers were of the view that they are adopting CSA practices and technologies due to the limited supply of canal water, climate change, drought-prone, massive groundwater extraction, rapidly declining groundwater table and increasing soil salinity over the time. Results revealed that uniform germination, higher yield and financial returns, the concentration of inputs and increase in resource use efficiency are the main advantages of CSA. The econometric analysis showed that implementation of CSA practices and technologies as judicious use of water and fertilizer, groundwater quality, access to extension services, and appropriate method and time of picking have a significant impact on the gross value of cotton product (GVP). The findings of the study would be helpful for policy makers to formulate policies that can minimize farmer's financial burden to adopt CSA technologies and implement for scaling out in Punjab and beyond.",0.9736456816229443,0.14242927801481126,0.08921434623414501,0.437696148018609,0.0156665237010125,0.019220204409332232,0.059090284493802436
An uncertain future: climate resilience of first-generation ranchers,"Policymakers and scholars agree that the aging and declining number of ranchers is a serious problem for the future of ranching and range management. Studies show that recruiting and retaining new ranchers is difficult due to a complex mix of start-up costs, knowledge and skill requirements, and regulatory barriers. While research suggests that first-generation farmers are different demographically and require individualised information, there is limited research on first-generation ranchers (FGRs); at best they are generalised as beginning farmers in research and outreach programs. This is surprising given ranchers' unique knowledge requirements relating to the production of food and fibre, and the management of vast areas of public and private land. Based on a rangeland decision-making survey of 507 California Cattlemen's Association members, this paper examines similarities and divergences in socioeconomic factors, management practices, drought adaptation strategies, information needs, and values between FGRs and multigenerational ranchers (MGRs). Survey results indicate FGRs and MGRs are not statistically different demographically and have similar values; however, key differences include FGRs using fewer information sources about ranching, fewer general management practices, and fewer drought adaptation practices. FGRs are also more susceptible to drought, and are underserved by organisations. Their vulnerability is particularly concerning, as many have limited drought experience, are more likely to take risks, and are less likely to find value and/or participate in ranching organisations. The future of rangelands requires that organisations interested in conserving rangelands and supporting ranchers re-evaluate assumptions about why FGRs and MGRs have different information needs beyond simplistic demographic identity, and instead focus on their affinity as FGRs in order to understand the complexity of the processes underlying these differences. We end with suggestions for a research agenda to support the climate resiliency of FGRs and increase the efficacy of support organisations.",0.738461465677262,0.3059650099922449,0.11398542470188751,0.3678731611077085,0.08334353852092345,0.06318642937079078,0.1823613559698748
"Determinants of Adaptation for Slow-Onset Hazards: The Case of Rice-Farming Households Affected by Seawater Intrusion in Northern Mindanao, Philippines","This study aimed to address the knowledge gaps on adaptive capacity of rural farming households to slow-onset hazards such as seawater intrusion. It defined household-level variables that can potentially explain adaptive capacity by using a principal component analysis and a regression model. In addition, it aimed to develop a measure-based index (MAI) to account for adaptation processes. The developed measure-based adaptation index addressed a number of shortcomings in previous studies and captured the variation in adaptation measures that rice farmers implement. The results indicated that adaptation takes place at different levels based on the propensity to adapt, the variety and diversity of adoption of various measures, the feasibility of the various measures, and the varying conditions of seawater intrusion. The research established a model of adaptation for seawater intrusion largely influenced by the rice farmers' economic capacity, which is crucial in optimizing the adaptation measures employed.",0.772756110619715,0.2578244179956985,0.10443792109259273,0.39475922174009315,0.1082474958842986,0.06811706956877835,0.12379252353617991
Adaptive perception and adaptation responses to weather shocks: An adaptation deficit,"This study examines the influence of adaptive perception on farmers' adaptive responses to climate change induced natural shocks in the Mekong River Delta (Viet Nam) from a data set of 329 farmers in 2017. Seemingly Unrelated Regression model is used and results show that, controlling for household and household head's characteristics, farm characteristics, institutional factor, infrastructure, climate conditions, and past climate experiences, adaptive perceptions are the most important factor of adaptive responses. With respect to policy implication, sources and quality of information can be of important consideration due to the potential infl uences on farmers' adaptive perception and their adaptation assessments. In addition, awareness on climate change and adaptation methods should be highlighted. Other policy options could also be suggested, such as: strengthening education level of farmers, and facilitating cheap technologies for farmers. © 2019 Agris on-line Papers in Economics and Informatics.",0.90988638203763,0.24116479073655,0.14164590840301558,0.42328207713231303,0.03253189369926305,0.02559352215693774,0.05967187185271646
"Misunderstanding conservation agriculture: Challenges in promoting, monitoring and evaluating sustainable farming","Commercial agriculture is central to problems of sustainability in food, water, energy and climate change. Appropriate solutions will depend on the effective promotion, monitoring and evaluation of changes in farming practice. Conservation agriculture (CA) is an important example of sustainable intensification and climate-smart agriculture, increasing the productivity and reliability of grain production while reducing agricultural inputs and future climate risks when adopted comprehensively. But to understand its implementation and benefits, researchers often rely on simplified measures of CA adoption (e.g., single proxies, binary measures, broad self assessments, expert estimates). Here we use a national survey of South Africa's commercial grain farmers (n = 441), contextualized by previous interviews, to investigate common measures of adoption and their implications for CA's promotion, monitoring and evaluation. These farmers are unusually informative, because they are unsubsidized but have the capacity, incentive and willingness to adapt to climate change. We find that they are adopting CA autonomously, but that their implementation is highly variable and their interpretation of farming practice differs from that of local experts. Single proxies, binary adoption variables and broad farmer self-assessments suggest that between 40 and 80% of farmers have adopted CA. However, when evaluated across the three CA principles using UN-defined adoption thresholds, the comprehensive adoption rate is only 14%. Farmers' definition of ""conservation"" differs substantially from that of the local experts most likely to be asked to contribute adoption estimates to global monitoring efforts, creating the potential for miscommunication. There is therefore substantial cause for concern in how CA is currently promoted, monitored and evaluated. Inaccurate adoption estimates jeopardize CA's potential as a climate change adaptation strategy, creating illusory progress that may disincentivize further substantive efforts towards agricultural sustainability and climate resilience.",0.8939061554367042,0.19887945822652733,0.12793732526490909,0.34845572160843646,0.0365813211051367,0.04100636710991351,0.03975259137926738

Climate variability and post-harvest food loss abatement technologies: evidence from rural Tanzania,"This paper focuses on improved storage and preservation technologies as an adaptation strategy in response to climate change. We also study the trade-off between improved cereal storage technologies and the preservation techniques among rural households in Tanzania.

Climate change adaptation strategies in response to food insecurity: The paradox of improved potato varieties adoption in eastern Ethiopia,"The non-avoidable nature of climate change occurrences and their adverse effects on smallholder farmers' livelihood and food security status calls for urgent interventions. In this study, we used a cross-sectional survey method. Data were collected from 365 sampled households in eastern Ethiopia to identify different climate change adaptation strategies and the associated factors in response to food insecurity. Three-stage probit model was employed for data analysis. Three adaptation strategies, namely: adoption of improved varieties, irrigation usage and intercropping were identified. The study result shows that Shantam, an improved potato variety, is the most widely grown in the study area. Frost, known as wurchi/ amadey by its local name, was found to be the worst types of climate change incidence that severely affects potato production in the study area. The analysis of sociodemographic variables showed mixed results on each of the three adaptation strategies. Moreover, the regression revealed paradoxical results whereby irrigation usage and intercropping as climate change adaptation strategies recede the adoption of improved potato varieties.",0.9517902433758676,0.21261050178411475,0.07111955416415992,0.6308389842312375,0.013536193713810483,0.01993611764052004,0.012110847167747517
"Rural livelihood resilience strategies in the face of harsh climatic conditions. The case of ward 11 Gwanda, South, Zimbabwe","Households living in rural areas of developing countries rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods and, as such, are highly dependent on climatic conditions. The study is located in Gwanda a dry southern region of Zimbabwe. This study unearths and assesses the livelihood resilience strategies households employ to fight food insecurity in the face of harsh climatic conditions. Thus enhances understanding on how households in the area manage drought and also assist in guiding targeted interventions on areas in similar contexts. The researcher adopted a mixed methods approach were Qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques were used. Data were collected using questionnaires, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and observations. Probability random sampling was used to select 284 respondents. The study revealed that increased frequency and periodicity of drought has created a crisis of food insecurity. To fight this, households engage in several on-farm strategies. These strategies are effective and efficient in reducing households' vulnerability to food insecurity. Challenges such as the increased frequency and periodicity of drought, environmental degradation, water scarcity, inadequate knowledge and skills and shortage of financial capital reduce the effectiveness of the strategies employed.",0.9433755649870266,0.28269786312101575,0.07500783328033442,0.7286621582836161,0.033814072767446426,0.013743255125876371,0.1367285649949745
Climate change policies and adaptive behavior of farmers in southern China,"Purpose - The paper analyzes the adaptive behavior of farmers in the Yunnan province of China, where drought is occurring more frequently. We focus on the experiences with adaptation to climate change by farmers in the rural areas of China. Methodology/approach - The research is based on a survey and a number of in-depth interviews of key stakeholders in a drought-stricken region. Findings - Where the government is not always coming forward, the farmers take initiatives to adapt to the new situation of drought. Different mechanisms are being used, some linked to government policies and subsidies, other initiatives are initiated by the farmers themselves, individually or in small groups. Research implications - More research on the livelihood strategies is necessary to better understand what these strategies mean for the household income and hence for the survival chances of poor households. Practical implications - Climate change encourages local actors to play a role in drought adaptation, developing policies for mitigating the consequences of drought, trying to create water markets and involving local companies and water user associations. The research suggests stimulating the initiatives of the farmers and to create an enabling environment for them. Social implications - Without government policies we will see growing inequalities in the rural areas of China. Originality/value - We studied how in the case of drought farmers react to adapt to the new reality. Different adaptation strategies are distinguished and their relation to different government policies is established. We observed that farmers find their own solutions and create their own governance structures to assure for example supply of additional water to their fields.

SMALLHOLDER FARMERS' PERCEPTIONS OF DROUGHT RISK AND ADOPTION OF MODERN MAIZE IN SOUTHERN MALAWI,"Modern maize varieties have been bred for drought tolerance and early maturity, to assist farmers in avoiding or escaping the effects of moisture stress in drought-prone areas. This study evaluates the prospects for widespread adoption of these modern maize varieties as a climate change adaptation strategy for smallholder farmers. Data are from a detailed household survey completed in four rural villages in Southern Malawi between May and July 2010. The empirical analysis involves estimation of an ordered logit regression model because the dependent variable is categorical, with one category for nonadoption (has never grown modern maize varieties) and three categories for the duration of growing a modern maize variety among adopters (this year only, 2 to 5 years and 6 years or more). The empirical findings indicate a positive association between a farmer's perception of drought risk and the adoption and continued use of modern maize. Regression results also show that farmers that value the traits of early maturity and drought tolerance are more likely to adopt modern maize varieties. There is evidence of some disadoption among farmers dissatisfied with maize genotype performance, in terms of poor storability and yield under drought conditions. Finally, the study highlights the urgent need for maize breeders interested in sustained use of modern varieties to simultaneously address robust drought tolerance, early maturity and storability. This underscores the importance of cognizance of local farmer preferences in crop breeding efforts.",0.9697653463663383,0.1864636443954114,0.07138536417266261,0.5218352159954145,0.01631914713459774,0.025869584000600722,0.06163504673161296
"Environmental change, adaptation strategies and the relevance of migration in Sub-Saharan drylands","Understanding coping and adaptation behaviour of different population groups in the context of global environmental change has become increasingly important, especially in regions with high vulnerability such as Sub-Saharan drylands. In this regard, household strategies tend to be dependent on local and context-specific conditions. However, the strategic development of climate change adaptation measures, as well as natural resource and migration management on national and international level require transferable results and recommendations. In this paper, a first attempt is made to address the lack of meta-knowledge and to create a bigger trans-regional picture on the topic. It provides an exploratory and systematic synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data from 63 studies covering more than 9700 rural households from Sub-Saharan African drylands. Relevant household coping and adaptation strategies under different types of environmental change are assessed with a particular focus on the role and relative significance of migration. The results demonstrate that strategies related to crop, livestock, soil and water management are, by far, the most common. Yet, various forms of migration are reported as strategy by about 23% of the households. Corroborated by qualitative findings, this emphasises the importance of migration for responding to unfavourable environmental conditions at the household level. Based on the synthesised literature, future directions for research needed to support socially and ecologically sustainable coping and adaptation are provided.",0.424977361431243,0.3721983723091914,0.09437497025615338,0.6421783255118829,0.08835568847034525,0.07047967433828843,0.12998807006883586
"Perception and adaptation strategies of rural people against the adverse effects of climate variability: A case study of Boset District, East Shewa, Ethiopia","This study explores the perception and adaptation strategies of rural households to the adverse effects of climate variability. To attain this purpose we posed two research questions: i) how do rural households perceive and/or experience the effects of climate variability? and ii) what are the adaptation strategies of people to events of climate variability? We surveyed 397 heads of households selected through systematic random sampling; and generated additional data from key informant interviews, focus group discussions, personal observations, and meteorological data. The results revealed overwhelming that the majority (99.5%) of respondents noticed changes in temperature which was also confirmed by the meteorological data; and 97.5% of the respondents again acknowledged changes in rainfall. As a consequence, households experienced reduced yield, complete crop failure, shortage of water both for people and animals, soil erosion, and assets destruction. To offset such consequences, 91.5% of the respondents used an array of adaptation strategies which broadly comprised of crop management related strategies, land management strategies, and diversification into non-farm activities. Nonetheless, respondents were challenged by multiple barriers such as lack of finance (73.8%), shortage of land (60.7%), lack of water (48.9%), and lack of access to modern inputs (45.1%). On the other hand, results from a multinomial logit model revealed that gender, farmland size, total annual income, access to a weather forecast, access to credit services, and distance to input/output markets have statistically significant effects on the choice of adaptation strategies. Hence, despite the wider awareness of climate variability, the multiple barriers to adaptation coupled with unmatched support from local authorities complicate matters. Our findings suggest the need for a collaborative approach that acts in a proactive manner to overcome adaptation barriers. This would improve effectiveness and pave the way to development.",0.9255812132760982,0.24887152262828696,0.09539357152894573,0.7033465808447392,0.021022173847407993,0.021545593807000215,0.070325446371459
Micro-level perception to climate change and adaptation issues: A prelude to mainstreaming climate adaptation into developmental landscape in India,"Climate change adds another dimension of challenges to the growth and sustainability of Indian agriculture. The growing exposure to livelihood shocks from climate variability/change and limited resource base of the rural community to adapt has reinforced the need to mainstream climate adaptation planning into developmental landscape. However, a better understanding of micro-level perceptions is imperative for effective and informed planning at the macro-level. In this paper, the grass-root level perspectives on climate change impacts and adaptation decisions were elicited at farm level in the Moga district of Punjab and Mahbubnagar district of Telangana, India. The farmers opined that the climatic variability impacts more than the long-term climate change. They observed change in the quantum, onset and distribution of rainfall, rise in minimum as well as maximum temperature levels, decline in crop yield and ground water depletion. The key socio-economic effects of climate change included decline in farm income, farm unemployment, rural migration and increased indebtedness among farmers. In order to cope with climate variability and change thereon, farmers resorted to adaptation strategies such as use of crop varieties of suitable duration, water conservation techniques, crop insurance and participation in non-farm activities and employment guarantee schemes. Farmers' adaptation to changing climate was constrained by several technological, socio-economic and institutional barriers. These include limited knowledge on the costs-benefits of adaptation, lack of access to and knowledge of adaptation technologies, lack of financial resources and limited information on weather. Besides, lack of access to input markets, inadequate farm labour and smaller farm size were the other constraints. Further, on the basis of the grass-root elicitation a 'Need-Based Adaptation' planning incorporating farmers' perceptions on climate change impacts, constraints in the adoption of adaptation strategies and plausible adaptation options were linked with the most suitable ongoing programmatic interventions of the Government of India. The study concluded that micro-level needs and constraints for various adaptation strategies and interventions should be an integral part of the programme development, implementation and evaluation in the entire developmental paradigm.",0.9574971317294377,0.20527501600031192,0.08984137076795477,0.5723967360926149,0.038266213798860756,0.01618866604808644,0.08378214003350148
Are farmers' adaptations enhancing food production? Evidence from China,"A primary goal of studying climate change adaptation is to identify the adaptation options that are used to improve crop productivity or reduce the negative impacts of climate change. Many of the adjustments in farm management that farmers adopt do not necessarily represent true adaptations to climate change, an issue often ignored in existing literature and resulting in a risk that policy makers are misled to think that adaptation is easier than it actually is, and thereby underestimate the challenge that climate change presents. The overall goal of this study is to identify whether farmers' adoptions are enhancing food production and adapting to climate change. The identification uses a plot-level panel from a survey of 619 rural households in three provinces in China and county-level weather data. With the use of plot and county-by-year fixed effects as well as instrumental variable approaches, our estimates show that the autonomous adoptions are not effective in improving crop yields. This implies that farmers' adoptions cannot be always considered adaptations to climate change. The paper provides a possible explanation for the results and concludes with policy implications.",0.9058424225098117,0.21788504520860952,0.09966779516639278,0.4040147675401415,0.030679165402474225,0.043724061101483455,0.015640560025773513
"Climate change-induced hazards and local adaptations in agriculture: a study from Koshi River Basin, Nepal","Changes in climate, associated hazards, local adaptations in agriculture, and socioeconomic factors affecting adaptation were investigated using data from a large survey of 2310 households (HHs) in the Koshi River Basin (KRB), Nepal. More than 80% of HHs had perceived changes in climate in the 10 years preceding the survey, and 20-40% had perceived increases in the occurrence of droughts, dry spells, floods, and livestock diseases. Around 36-45% of crop-growing HHs perceived a decline in the production of staple crops such as paddy, wheat, maize, and millets, which was mainly attributed to climate change and related hazards. The decline in local food production meant that HH dependence on external sources for food had increased. Only 32% of HHs had taken some form of adaptive actions in agriculture to address these challenges; actions included not planting certain crops, introducing new crops, changing farming practices, not rearing certain livestock species, and investing in irrigation. The factors affecting the likelihood of a household undertaking adaptive actions included literacy of the head of household, household size, size of owned agricultural land, diversification of income sources, and insurance. Based on these findings, the study has suggested some approaches in the KRB which could contribute to building agricultural resilience to climate change.",0.9501250625391312,0.1753735389945222,0.0763626288573679,0.5429312669860187,0.04305765659563407,0.022141458302915702,0.08659173889518845
Adapting agriculture to the drought hazard in rural China: household strategies and determinants,"This study is to identify the major methods used by local farmers to adapt to the drought hazard and to examine factors influencing their decisions to adapt in Yongqiao District, China. A random sampling technique was used to select 200 households in Yongqiao, while descriptive statistics and binary logit models were used to analyze the data obtained from the households. The results show that most farmers in the study area were aware of climate change. They were taking measures to protect their livelihoods against perceived change in climate. Results indicate that factors explaining farmers' adaptation choices include gender, the level of education, farming experience, farm size, household income, and perceptions of climate change impacts. The findings of this study can help decision-makers to design appropriate adaptation policies to cope with and adapt in drought situation.",0.959284730964523,0.22910469034530984,0.07679788917796984,0.5639684928764404,0.025458280984158352,0.019478402023530492,0.055510498184719904
Perceptions of the effects of floods and droughts on livelihoods: lessons from arid Kenya,"Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to understand how people practicing natural resource-based livelihoods in arid Kenya perceive that their livelihoods are being affected by floods and droughts and how to integrate these local perceptions of impacts into larger-scale climate change adaptation initiatives and policy. Design/methodology/approach-In Isiolo County, Kenya, 270 households were surveyed in seven communities, six focus group discussions were held and a document review was conducted. Findings-The major livelihood practiced in Isiolo is pastoralism (71 per cent), but agriculture and non-agro-pastoral activities also play an important role, with 53 per cent of the respondents practicing more than one type of livelihood. In Isiolo, floods have a large impact on agriculture (193 respondents out of 270), while droughts impact both agriculture (104 respondents) and livestock (120 respondents), and more specifically, cattle-keeping (70 respondents). Research limitations/implications-The research may have implications for the importance of using local perceptions of the effects of climate change on livelihoods for larger-scale interventions. It also provides a case study of local perceptions of the effects of floods and droughts on livelihoods in an arid area with natural resource-dependent livelihoods. Practical implications-To understand local perceptions and use local perceptions for larger-scale adaptation interventions and policy.

Trees and agroforestry for coping with extreme weather events: experiences from northern and central Viet Nam,"Although tree-based farming systems are often assumed to be ""resilient"" or ""climate-smart"" options, adoption is limited. It could be that the sensitivity of individual tree species to extreme weather events is poorly documented or new systems include unfamiliar species and technologies. This paper reports on initial results of an evaluation of farmers' experiences with trees and crops for responding to major climatic exposures in 21 villages in northern and north-central Viet Nam. Our study assessed the suitability and roles of trees by analyzing data gathered through focus group discussions, workshops and a survey of 661 households. The results showed that a majority of households were exposed annually to what they perceived as natural hazards. Experiences with using trees for coping and adaptation depended on household income status, awareness and policies. In particular, farms with trees had shorter recovery time after most types of natural disasters, except for cold spells, demonstrating economic and environmental buffers. Many leaders were unfamiliar with agroforestry and mainly looking for economies of scale, hence oriented to land use rather than landscape planning. This indicates disconnects between farmers' needs and policymakers' priorities with respect to climate change adaptation strategies. Existing agroforestry systems reflected a transition from indigenous or current farming systems via changing to either new species or technologies rather than changing both at the same time. Gaps in current adaptation strategies and key areas for policy and research interventions are finally discussed.",0.8255833846598026,0.2656570916510613,0.1250636075400235,0.44885343111098236,0.04051766759125732,0.03239521119290366,0.03223036450068024
Climate risk adaptation by smallholder farmers: the roles of trees and agroforestry,"Smallholder farmers are vulnerable to environmental, climate and weather-related stress, including climate change. There is an increase in understanding of the benefits of agroforestry systems both at farm and landscape scales, and that incorporating trees on farms through agroforestry systems has emerged as having the potential to enhance the resilience of smallholders to current and future climate risks including future climate change. Drawing on global examples with a focus on African case studies, this paper demonstrates the versatile roles of trees and agroforestry in reducing smallholder's exposure to climate-related risks. It goes on to identify challenges in the promotion and adoption of agroforestry at the farm and landscape levels as a climate change adaptation strategy. The paper highlights areas for further research, policy and dissemination efforts, and identifies entry points for agroforestry adoption.",0.8148278781163907,0.2814476416450667,0.20978035627062022,0.46660351224234464,0.03445772662791623,0.0474295671963497,0.06081664336471692
How to Effectively Enhance Sustainable Livelihoods in Smallholder Systems: A Comparative Study from Western Kenya,"Increasing communities' adaptive capacity is crucial to enhancing the sustainability of livelihoods and landscapes in smallholder systems. This study evaluates the contributions of an asset-based community-driven local development project, which has an objective to enhance farmer livelihoods through context-specific agricultural and agroforestry training, in line with farmers' identities, interests, and preferences. The project was implemented in two areas of the wider Nyando river basin: the Lower and Middle Nyando sites. The project effects on farmer livelihoods were evaluated by analyzing overall income enhancement through the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices via the computation of total values of harvest. Socioeconomic data from 183 households, half of which were involved in the project, were considered. The findings showed that locality played an important role in the adoption and success of good agricultural practices. Additional significant positive factors included project participation, size of land operated, horticulture farming, livestock ownership, ownership of a title deed, hours worked, and crop species richness. The number of years farmed had a significant negative correlation with the value of harvest. Considering the stark differences in livelihood effects in both sites, researchers conclude that external support for climate-smart agriculture uptake needs to be considerate of, and respond to, biophysical and socioeconomic context.",0.8851692958937265,0.23081438967158896,0.13012955724479555,0.5444306870905141,0.026665462409572585,0.021416905947822525,0.060205119023415576
Impact of sedentarization program on the livelihood and food security of Ethiopian pastoralists,"The debate among the academia, development practitioners, policy makers and large communities on the viability of pastoral sedentarization as an adaptation mechanism against climate change stresses in the drylands remains inconclusive. This study empirically investigated the livelihood and food security impact of government's sedentarization program implemented in the drylands of Ethiopia since 2002 by using the propensity score matching method. Results show that participation in the sedentarization program is significantly and positively influenced by education, road distance and extension services, but negatively affected by family size, livestock owned and town distance. Moreover, the results show that the program has significantly increased expenditure on education and sources of income by 293% and 40.49%, respectively, but significantly decreased percentage expenditure on food by 13.45%. The groups are markedly alike with regard to their annual per capita income, expenditure on health and dietary diversity. This study concludes that pastoral sedentarization improved the livelihood of participants, but worsened their food security situation with its overall welfare effect remaining indeterminate.

Adaptation to climate change: historical evidence from the Indian monsoon,"Estimating the potential impacts of climate change requires understanding the ability of agents to adapt to changes in their climate. This paper uses panel data from India spanning from 1956 to 1999 to investigate the ability of farmers to adapt. To identify adaptation, the author exploits persistent, multidecadal monsoon regimes during which droughts or floods are more common. These regimes generate medium-run variation in average rainfall, and there is spatial variation in the timing of the regimes. Using a fixed-effects strategy, she tests whether farmers have adapted to the medium-run rainfall variation induced by the monsoon regimes. The author finds evidence that farmers adjust their irrigation investments and their crop portfolios in response to the medium-run rainfall variation. However, adaptation only recovers a small fraction of the profits farmers have lost due to adverse climate variation.",0.9022764111458865,0.24953792738633546,0.0930434637615562,0.5,0.045183969061234626,0.02953334867683441,0.07880742664324485
Responses of sub-Saharan smallholders to climate change: Strategies and drivers of adaptation,"Rural farm households in sub-Saharan Africa are vulnerable to climate variability due to their limited adaptive capacity. This paper explores how adaptation strategies are adopted by small-holders in sub-Saharan Africa as a function of their adaptive capacity. The latter is characterised by five types of capital: natural, physical, financial, human, and social. We use responses from farm households in sub-Saharan Africa dating from 1536 obtained by Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). This data provides information on the adoption of adaptation practices during the study period as well as information with which we develop indicators for the five types of capital. The results suggest that all the five types of capital positively influence adoption of adaptation practices. Human and social capital both displayed a positive and significant effect on the uptake of most adaptation practices. This finding suggests that the effect of less tangible kinds of capital such as knowledge, individual perceptions, farmers' networks and access to information may be stronger than normally assumed. Directing more development policies towards enhancing human and social capital may therefore be more cost-effective than further investments into physical and financial capital, and could help in overcoming social barriers to adaptation to climate change.",0.8566454555686455,0.2995014093561495,0.11078708427364607,0.6018215187726039,0.07153414485070791,0.03733533282096153,0.07618059474152594
Perception of Climate Change and Impact on Land Allocation and Income: Empirical Evidence from Vietnam's Delta Region,"Using a sample survey from Vietnam's M&RRD, this study examines both the factors affecting smallholder households' perceptions of climate change, and the impact of climatic change on smallholders' income and land allocation decisions. Results show a significant and negative impact of perception of climate change on income of smallholder households. Smallholders with perceived climate changes reduce land allocated to paddy crop. Farmers make strategic decision to counter the negative effects of climate change by increasing the amount of rented land for paddy crop production, while at the same time decreasing the amount of owned land allocated to paddy crop.",0.9469581382481878,0.218810580094783,0.06012491642660322,0.5447940432683379,0.023277518360022436,0.021951569070060222,0.03139759447475603
"Climate change adaptation measure on agricultural communities of Dhye in Upper Mustang, Nepal","The people in remote areas of Nepal, like Dhye Village, have adjusted their agriculture-based livelihood to arid environment and have been balancing their needs with what nature provided. However, the livelihood of residence of Dhye was becoming more difficult due to impact of climate change (CC). This research had attempted to evaluate the potential adaptation measures to avoid CC-induced migration based on analysis of hydro-meteorological data, documented bio-physical and socio-economic effects of CC, locally available natural resources, and recommended best adaptation measures. The study assessed that low rainfall and erratic pattern, shifting snowfall pattern, decreasing humidity, and increased air temperature created the water stress as the result dried up the spring and dropping of soil moisture which had direct negative impact on supporting healthy plant growth and animals had to travel further for fodder and water. In realized that fact residents in village have adopted different adaptation strategy mainly seasonal migration, started selling their properties and leaving the village for the collective-survival of the community, the Dhye farmers unanimously decided to leave their habitats enmasse and resettle at Thangchung (near the bank of Dhye River), thus become climate refugee. The findings revealed that there was a direct link between the changes in climate parameters in Dhye Village and its consequences, and suggesting the resettlement of them to Thangchung as the best adaption option with need to make proper policy on climate change adaptation, and its timely implementation that could have averted this unfortunate situation.",0.7161928117763059,0.2896172851475399,0.10540924074772592,0.35896206391639723,0.05182641165764594,0.07838366795441205,0.1404722078905271
Farm-level adaptation to climate and environmental changes: a triple hurdle model of coping strategies,"This paper applies a triple hurdle decision making model in order to understand adaptation decisions by using farm level data from the 2011 National survey on household life conditions and agriculture in Niger, a landlocked country of the Sahel. In fact, farms decision making process is often taken sequentially and the model used in this paper takes into account the sequences and the diversity of the different adaptation decisions. The results show that the farmers adoption decision-making process and the different coping mechanisms depend on their characteristics and exposition to environmental and climatic problems. Health, age, available labor, and past climatic and environmental damages are crucial determining factors in explaining the decision, the choice, and the intensity of adaptation. These results can help to better understand the adoption decision making process in order to assist farmers, especially those who are the most vulnerable to environmental and ecological problems resulting from climate change.",0.7247841957847727,0.2958183970451905,0.08943484760273071,0.443744632270883,0.10182055901370701,0.04070617208744075,0.05984234064297643
"Assessing newly introduced climate change adaptation strategy packages among rural households: Evidence from Kaou local government area, Tahoua State, Niger Republic","This research discusses new strategies developed and introduced by national and international partners to help farmers in building adaptative capacity against the negative externalities of climate change. The purpose of this study is to determine and to assess the most important adaptation strategies introduced by development partners. Based on the recognition interview with farmers and synthesis of previous research, 13 strategies were compiled and included in the study. Thus, an advance in the balanced incomplete block design was used to design the questionnaire served as data collection tools. For each question, respondents were asked to choose their best and their worst strategies. Thus, the difference between the best and worst strategies consistent with random utility theory was used for the modelling. Results show that herd rebuilding, human capacity building, introduction of fishing, water and soil conservation activities, introduction of leafy vegetable such as Moringa oleifera, financial credit, forage seed marketing and introduction of agriculture inputs were the most important strategies, while the support to vegetable production, income-generating activities, the use of agricultural improved seed varieties, anti-fire band making and cereal bank introduction were the least important adaptation strategies for farmers.

Adaptation measures to sustain indigenous practices and the use of indigenous knowledge systems to adapt to climate change in Mutoko rural district of Zimbabwe,"This article examines adaptation measures used to sustain indigenous practices and the use of indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) to adapt to climate change in Mutoko rural district of Zimbabwe. Community-based adaptation is able to reduce the vulnerability as well as improve the resilience of the local people to climatic variability and change. Subsistence farmers have always adopted adaptive strategies to some of these changes over the years. As such, the adoption of indigenous practices will significantly help rural community members to adapt to climate change. This study employed a qualitative method and an exploratory design, and the results are derived from 30 purposively selected in-depth interviews. The study discovered that there are numerous measures used to adapt to climate change and subsequently to sustain indigenous practices. The study also found that the community no longer grows maize in large quantities, having shifted to millet and sorghum in order to adapt to climate change. The community also provided various strategies to adapt to climate change. These strategies include mulching, creating large storage houses for produce and creating temporary walls on riverbanks in order to store water when the rivers dry up. This study concludes that climate change adaptation measures employed by the community have significantly helped them to sustain their indigenous practices in many ways. Also, the use of IKS, through activities such as crop type change from maize to traditional millet and sorghum (which facilitates traditional lifestyle and activities), re-establishes the community's indigenous practices since they are made to observe the practices of yesteryear.",0.9431927620481902,0.28918449064858803,0.131544511579452,0.5588384971430564,0.0653326456070991,0.017765626534808412,0.07980709958177576
Climate change adaptation constraints among smallholder farmers in rural households of central region of Ghana,"Agriculture in Africa is reported to be vulnerable to climate change due to high rate of poverty, rain-fed dependent agriculture and low adaptive capacity. Adaptation remains essentially necessary and sufficient condition to reduce the adverse effect of climate change. Smallholder farmers, however, face plethora of constraints in the choice of adaptation mechanisms. The study employed both secondary (daily rainfall from 1994–2014) and primary data to identify the adaptation mechanisms and assess the level of significance and agreement on the factors that constrain the utilization of the identified mechanisms among smallholder farmers in the rural households of Central region of Ghana. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 214 households across three agro-ecological zones in the region. Household questionnaire administration was preceded by community focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Kendall’s coefficient of concordance and Friedman’s test were used to test the level of agreement and significance of mean ranks of identified constraints, respectively. The findings showed that there is a vast intra and inter annual variability of rainfall over the 20-year period and smallholder farmers have embraced adaptation mechanisms such as crop diversification, improved variety and breed, soil and water conservation, soil and plant related strategies, and diversification to non-farming activities. Moreover, there was relatively good agreement (about 50 percent) among smallholder farmers of the identified constraints. The mean ranks of the constraints significantly differ from one another with the three topmost constraints being unreliable water source, lack of information on climate change and limited income. But for crop diversification, poor extension services and lack of credit are factors that cut across all the identified adaptation mechanisms. The study recommends among others that government policies should ensure an extensive accessibility of farmers to extension services. © 2017, Ecological Laboratory.

"Policy support, social capital, and farmers' adaptation to drought in China","Increasingly severe drought has not only threatened food security but also resulted in massive socioeconomic losses. In the face of increasingly serious drought conditions, the question of how to mitigate its impacts through appropriate measures has received great attention. The overall goal of this study is to examine the influence of policies and social capital on farmers' decisions to adopt adaptation measures against drought. The study is based on a large-scale household and village survey conducted in six provinces nationwide. The survey results show that 86% of rural households have taken adaptive measures to protect crop production against drought, most of which are non-engineering measures. In the case of non-engineering measures, changing agricultural production inputs and adjusting seeding or harvesting dates are two popular options. A multivariate regression analysis reveals that government policy support against drought such as releasing early warning information and post-disaster services, technical assistance, financial and physical supports have significantly improved farmers' ability to adapt to drought. However, since only 5% of villages benefited from such supports, the government in China still has significant room to implement these assistances. Moreover, having a higher level of social capital in a farm household significantly increases their adaptation capacity against drought. Therefore, the government should pay particular attention to the farming communities, and farmers within a community who have a low level of social capital. Finally, farmers' ability to adapt to drought is also associated with the characteristics of their households and local communities. The results of this study also have implications for national adaptation plans for agriculture under climate change in other developing countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Camel management as an adaptive strategy to climate change by pastoralists in southern Ethiopia,"Introduction: Experiences of low rainfall and frequent droughts have had enormous impacts on livestock production and pastoralists’ livelihoods in southern Ethiopia. The Borana pastoralists are dependent on livestock husbandry with the dominance of cattle in their herds for generations. Recently, the Borana communities have engaged in extensive livestock species diversification, with more focus on camel management as an adaptation strategy to the severity of recurrent droughts. Although increasing interests in camel management among the Borana pastoralists are acknowledged, the driving forces for the increase in camel population in the region have not been addressed. The aim of this study was to assess the trend in camel management as an adaptation strategy towards climate change among the Borana pastoral households. The study also investigated evidence of climate change and the driving factors for camel adoption. Methods: The study was conducted in three purposively selected kebeles, which is a lower administrative unit in Ethiopia, of Yabello district in Borana Zone in southern Ethiopia focusing on 156 randomly selected camel-owning households. The study employed both quantitative and qualitative methods whereby data gathering tools such as key informant interviews (KII), focus group discussions (FGD), household surveys (HS), and field observations were used. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics using SPSS software version 16. Results: Pastoralists’ perceptions and the existing meteorological data analysis showed an increasing trend in temperature but a decreasing pattern in rainfall over the last 27 years (i.e., during the last four Gada periods). Both pastoralists’ observations and existing meteorological data analysis showed an increasing incidence of recurrent droughts with decreasing availability of grazing and water resources. Respondents further explained that cattle are more vulnerable during severe droughts. The findings also showed that camel management as an adaptation strategy by the Borana pastoralists began recently and showed a steady increase in trend over the last four Gada periods. Pastoralists’ perceptions and the existing analysis confirmed that camels’ potential for high milk production and their capacities to withstand harsh environmental condition are among the many reasons that contributed to the adoption of camels by pastoralists in southern Ethiopia. Camels were also more preferred with the changing ecology of rangeland vegetation dynamics towards bush encroachment. Conclusions: It seems that the high potential of camels for milk production and their abilities to withstand harsh environmental conditions are the major driving forces that contributed to the adoption of camels by pastoralists in southern Ethiopia. Hence, the adoption of camels by pastoralists in southern Ethiopia could be best understood in terms of livelihood diversification option to ensure the food security of pastoral households. We conclude that the increase in camel population in Borana during the last four Gada periods could be attributed to communities’ responses to the impact of climate change and frequent droughts. © 2017, The Author(s).",0.9048782419122607,0.21375672380187655,0.10387499712703105,0.6501046973673732,0.027294143773590712,0.02086667911432347,0.03998880007922682
"Climate change, vulnerability and adaptation experiences of farmers in Al-Suwayq Wilayat, Sultanate of Oman","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to give policy makers, professionals and researchers in Sultanate of Oman and in the region an understanding of the impacts of climate change (CC) related to agriculture and offer fanning communities a basis for developing adaptation strategies. It is important to clearly understand and realize what is happening at the community level, because farming communities are the most climate vulnerable groups in this region. The information generated from this study is expected to be used by stakeholders, particularly the Omani Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, to address issues related to CC and its variability in areas of similar agro-climatic conditions. Design/methodology/approach - Primary data from the study site were collected through structured interview, interviews with community leaders, and field observation. The participatory rural appraisal method was applied to gather information on perception and awareness of CC, vulnerability, adaptation measures of local farmers and communities to minimize such impacts. The focused group discussions approach was used to understand the attitudes, perceptions and existing practices. Findings - The analysis of primary data and the perception of the local people indicated that a shift in the sowing period has occurred from July to the end of September. This shift appears to be in response to the shortening of rainfall period and increased frequency of drought. A combination of adaptation strategies are in place, such as proper timing of agricultural operations and crop diversification, changing planting dates, the use of crop varieties, the use of increased water and soil conservation measures and diversifying from farm to non-farm activities. Originality/value - This paper provides valuable inputs for policy makers, managers at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, researchers and other stakeholders on issues related to CC impacts on agriculture and its management through appropriate adaptation strategies in Oman and the region.",0.9179558377579857,0.23433545801813213,0.107580237098818,0.5107512195768411,0.04585408191148576,0.03370771642539176,0.08043978737054222
"Effects of climate change on a peri-urban farming community in Lagos, Nigeria","This paper investigates the effects of climate change on agricultural activities in Igbe Farming Community, Lagos, Nigeria. The paper adopts a case study methodology in which structured questionnaires were administered on 161 farmers in the community. Information on the socio-economic characteristics of the farmers, their agricultural practices, knowledge of, vulnerability to and adaptation to climate change were obtained. The study revealed that most of the migrants lease their farm plots from the indigenous land owners on annual or biennial basis and made marginal profits of $200 to $350 per farming cycle. Erratic weather patterns and aggressive urban growth of the Lagos Megacity were the major challenges they faced. Forty-eight percent of respondents thus engaged in informal enterprises to cushion the effects. The paper concludes by advancing strategies for addressing identified challenges and these include the establishment of farming cooperatives in order to access agricultural land and support from institutional bodies. © 2014 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.",0.9078717280815841,0.2379593729569112,0.09761198157447777,0.555872885410746,0.03132859801132074,0.02747403522230211,0.0229910974134872
The role of community-based livestock management institutions in the adoption and scaling up of pigeon peas in Malawi,"Although decades of research show long-duration pigeon peas (PPs) as a best-bet technology that enhances nutrition, soil fertility, crop diversification, food security, climate-change resilience, agroecological sustain ability, and incomes of resource-poor smallholder farmers in Saharan Africa (SSA), PP adoption remains low. This exploratory qualitative study examines obstacles to PP adoption and their relative importance, strategies used to protect PPs from livestock damage, and the conditions that shape the emergence and effectiveness of Community Based Livestock Management (CBLM) arrangements to prevent PP damage. We conducted focus group discussions, participatory rural appraisal (PRA), and key-informant interviews in five communities at different levels and duration of PP adoption, and used theoretical insights from agrarian political economy. Livestock damage was the biggest obstacle to PP growing in new PP sites; poor markets and production factors dominated in the established sites. Individual crop-protection strategies were often time-consuming, costly, and/or ineffective. While chief-based livestock-management systems protected all crops satisfactorily during the rainy season, they were insufficient to protect PPs during the dry season. CBLM arrangements controlled livestock damage and protected PP relatively effectively throughout the year. Implemented only at the relatively established PP-growing sites, CBLM arrangements were most effective at the site (Mpokwa) where PP prices were good and markets reliable, PP was the top or major cash crop, PP growers were powerful and in the majority, and institutions pre-existed for use in CBLM. The findings lead to the following hypothesis: smallholder farmers are likely to invest time and energy in collective livestock-management approaches to prevent damage to pigeon peas when expected economic benefits of adoption exceed perceived costs for most growers, mediated by socioeconomic differentiation and power relations among major stakeholders. Future research should empirically examine determinants of CBLM emergence for PP protection and scale-up.",0.901085636556539,0.19925277109798592,0.09085523981080489,0.4943056136495461,0.035569887126772504,0.030867538317285306,0.04303558382030298
Agricultural diversification as an important strategy for achieving food security in Africa,"Farmers in Africa have long adapted to climatic and other risks by diversifying their farming activities. Using a multi-scale approach, we explore the relationship between farming diversity and food security and the diversification potential of African agriculture and its limits on the household and continental scale. On the household scale, we use agricultural surveys from more than 28,000 households located in 18 African countries. In a next step, we use the relationship between rainfall, rainfall variability, and farming diversity to determine the available diversification options for farmers on the continental scale. On the household scale, we show that households with greater farming diversity are more successful in meeting their consumption needs, but only up to a certain level of diversity per ha cropland and more often if food can be purchased from off-farm income or income from farm sales. More diverse farming systems can contribute to household food security; however, the relationship is influenced by other factors, for example, the market orientation of a household, livestock ownership, nonagricultural employment opportunities, and available land resources. On the continental scale, the greatest opportunities for diversification of food crops, cash crops, and livestock are located in areas with 500-1,000 mm annual rainfall and 17%-22% rainfall variability. Forty-three percent of the African cropland lacks these opportunities at present which may hamper the ability of agricultural systems to respond to climate change. While sustainable intensification practices that increase yields have received most attention to date, our study suggests that a shift in the research and policy paradigm toward agricultural diversification options may be necessary.",0.9704996134829316,0.18365041931822657,0.11065281514138343,0.6732029515371696,0.023124522933809514,0.011112714849230727,0.02553865363989981

Determinants of farmers' adaptation to climate change in agricultural production in the central region of Vietnam,"This paper discusses the likely changes in farm cultural practices that farmers would adopt to minimize agricultural production losses as a response to the increasing occurrence of extreme weather conditions due to climate change in the Central Region of Viet Nam. Using binary logit model and multivariate probit model, this paper examined different factors influencing farmersTiO(2)-N' decision on adaptation to climate change in their agricultural production. Training attendance, farm size, damage level, educational level, farming experience, access to credit, and gender were the factors that influenced significantly the probability that farmers would adapt to climate change. Of these factors, attendance in climate change training and farm size were the most important factors affecting the farmersTiO(2)-N' decision on adaptation to climate change, while labor availability and membership in local organizations were not. Three policy recommendations were proposed to enhance small-scale farmersTiO(2)-N' adaptive capacity to climate change in the region. These include: iTiO(2)-N). broadening of training courses on climate change; iiTiO(2)-N). institute policies that would promote consolidation of farmlands; and, iiiTiO(2)-N). integrate concepts of climate change and climate change adaptation into the operation of the local organizations.",0.9398065155539753,0.2150358512341473,0.0759432754469175,0.5375942175410432,0.03379761818864265,0.013495860575746718,0.01608024078281566
Indigenous coping and adaptation strategies to climate change of local communities in Tanzania: a review,"Climate change has major impacts to the livelihoods of the rural communities. In order to counteract the situation communities have developed various means for coping and adapting to the impacts. This paper reviews the various adaptation strategies by which different local communities (fishermen, pastoralists and farmers) in Tanzania have developed and discusses the sustainability of some of the strategies. It has been documented that farmers in Tanzania use traditional practices such as terracing (matuta), ngolo, tree planting, and construction of locally based water reservoirs (nkunisa), mixed cropping and crop diversification. Pastoralists use strategies such as ngitiri, rain water harvesting in ditches (malambo), check dams and engagement in alternative economic activities; and fishermen use methods such as change in fishing time, deep water fishing, scheduling particular time for fishing and engagement in other alternative economic activities. Based on the ability of the strategy to improve the capacity of the communities to respond to climate change effects, ease of implementation, the affordability, the strategies have been categorized as sustainable or not. It has been noted that the use of the sustainable indigenous strategies can improve the management of climate change effects provided that the underlying limitations are overcome. The limitations to the effectiveness of some of the documented coping and adaptation strategies may arise for instance from failure to fit the local context. It is therefore concluded that the analysis of a number of scenarios need to be undertaken prior to replication of any strategy.",0.7767409775623686,0.23453765829207598,0.09927327771481217,0.6145620539076035,0.0809509770390722,0.05611355018903852,0.17789621058759936
Risk management in rainfed agriculture: An analysis of strategies and adaptations followed by farmers in Madhya Pradesh,"Madhya Pradesh is the major producer of soybean in India. Being predominantly rainfed, the state faces high risks in its cultivation. The study undertook a primary survey in Madhya Pradesh to analyze the risk perception of farmers, elucidate the strategies followed by farmers to adapt with the risk and to identify the factors influencing their adoption. The results infer that late onset of monsoon, erratic rainfall and pest and diseases were the major risks. The major risks were related to untimely rainfall, drought and biotic factors like diseases and pest. The major adaptation strategies adopted were intercropping (49%), crop insurance (45%), micro irrigation (17%) and varietal diversification (39%). The study discerns need to develop drought tolerant varieties for rainfed regions, low cost micro-irrigation systems, enhanced credit availability to the farmers and promotion of crop insurance to adapt with production risks.",0.9768523744846602,0.18167651307820723,0.056005652711497635,0.4792421782730467,0.017298385950223996,0.015008373668728463,0.03494612846448611
Farmers' perceptions and adaptation behaviours concerning land degradation: A theoretical framework and a case-study in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China,"Land degradation through environmental pollution represents a serious threat to vulnerable populations in rural China. To better understand farmers' perceptions of land degradation and their corresponding adaptation behaviour, this paper presents a theoretical framework to explain the interactions among awareness, perception, mitigation, and adaptation, and tests the framework using a case-study. A case-study was conducted in Qinghai, where historical environmental pollution from a chemical plant had caused the contamination of soil, groundwater, and river water, which had negatively impacted the livelihood of local farmers. A questionnaire survey was conducted (n=277), and the results were used to test the theoretical framework using structural equation modelling. Results indicated strong structural relationships between awareness and perceptions (r=.75, p<.01), a relatively strong relationship between mitigation and adaptation (r=.63, p=.02), and a weak relationship between perception and mitigation (r=.20, p=.54). The study results suggested that farmers were well aware of land degradation issues, but they lacked in-depth knowledge about the situation and about sophisticated adaptation methods; therefore, they had chosen the easiest adaptation strategy- to avoid the degraded land. The farmers were less willing to bear significant financial costs in adaptation; however, the proportion of respondents adopting moving' as an adaptation strategy was relatively high, suggesting that farmland degradation in combination with employment opportunities in urban areas may be causing environmental displacement and accelerating urbanization. The authors of this paper recommend that policymakers should consider more than just technical factors in addressing China's environmental pollution and land degradation problems. The socio-economic status of farmers should be a critical component in the equation, and bottom-up empowerment adaptation behaviour should be used in combination with top-down mitigation.",0.8080084368426915,0.29676308181928757,0.09611925472464669,0.4281292897584447,0.04977092271039134,0.05226151626707997,0.10823972095656935
"Gendered opportunities and constraints to scaling up: a case study of spontaneous adaptation in a pastoralist community in Mwanga District, Tanzania","There is a growing momentum within development circles for pro-active strategies to facilitate the climate change adaptation of pastoralist communities. However, where planned adaptation originates outside a community, it has the potential to alter or eclipse autonomous forms of local adaptation. This paper identifies the range of autonomous adaptive practices undertaken by a Maasai pastoralist community and examines existing opportunities and constraints to adaptation. Field data were collected at three complementary levels: community, household and individual. Results indicate that many adaptive practices used in this community have been modified from past risk management strategies drawn directly from pastoralists' experience in dry-land environments. However, not all pastoralists are able to engage in these adaptive practices. Gender and wealth inequality pose a challenge to scaling up as they influence access to land and water for irrigation as well as financial assets required to access adaptive practices that are available in the wider community. This research concludes that planned adaptation should take into consideration the full range of existing adaptive practices and inequality in access as this provides information on opportunities and barriers to scaling up.",0.634691080939606,0.2771796337710282,0.13428333166504014,0.4887388676328457,0.06422925118698465,0.055703653900161305,0.1772490356906208
How climate awareness influences farmers' adaptation decisions in Central America?,"Central America is one of the regions with the highest vulnerability to climate change, with negative effects projected to affect its economy and food security. To address this issue, an integrative farm management approach such as Climate-Smart Agriculture can help reorient agricultural practices towards climate adaptation and food security. Past studies have shown that several factors can either hinder or encourage the adoptions of Climate-Smart practices, including subjective expectations and perceptions. Building on this literature, we analyze farmers' climate awareness and their perceptions regarding the change in climate patterns as well as their choices of fanning practices to adapt to these changes. We show that reforestation was the preferred adaptation strategy among interviewed farmers and that educational profiles and the size of landholdings drive the adoption of this and other practices. Soil management and introduction of new crops are preferred by literate farms with large farmlands, whereas illiterate farmers with smaller farmland tend to move towards farm intensification with an increase in the utilization of external inputs. Our findings provide evidence to support the design of capacity development interventions targeting specific groups of farmers according to their main crop and education profile.",0.9699566575874279,0.211069150128383,0.0977937452376865,0.4609366424639519,0.021127973615423127,0.016134148235475508,0.017416668916602554
A systematic review on Asian's farmers' adaptation practices towards climate change,"Climate change in Asia is affecting farmers' daily routines. Much of the focus surrounding climate change has targeted the economic and environmental repercussions on farming. Few systematic reviews have been carried out on the social impacts of climate change among farmers in Asia. The present article set out to analyse the existing literature on Asian farmers' adaptation practices towards the impacts of climate change. Guided by the PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) review method, a systematic review of the Scopus and Web of Science databases identified 38 related studies. Further review of these articles resulted in six main themes crop management, irrigation and water management, farm management, financial management, physical infrastructure management and social activities. These six themes further produced a total of 35 sub-themes. Several recommendations are highlighted related to conducting more qualitative studies, to have specific and a standard systematic review method for guide research synthesis in context of climate change adaptation and to practice complimentary searching techniques such as citation tracking, reference searching, snowballing and contacting experts.

Smallholders' uneven capacities to adapt to climate change amid Africa's 'green revolution': Case study of Rwanda's crop intensification program,"Development programs and policies can influence smallholder producers' abilities to adapt to climate change. However, gaps remain in understanding how households' adaptive capacities can become uneven. This paper investigates how development transitions-such as the recent adoption of 'green revolution' agricultural policies throughout sub-Saharan Africa-intersect with cross-scale social-environmental processes to unevenly shape smallholders' adaptive capacities and adaptation pathways. Drawing on quantitative and qualitative material from a multi-season study in Rwanda, we investigate smallholder adaptation processes amid a suite of rural development interventions. Our study finds that adaptive capacities arise differentially across livelihood groups in the context of evolving environmental, social, and political economic processes. We show how social institutions play key roles in shaping differential adaptation pathways by enabling and/or constraining opportunities for smallholders to adapt livelihood and land use strategies. Specifically, Rwanda's Crop Intensification Program enables some wealthier households to adapt livelihoods by generating income through commercial agriculture. At the same time, deactivation of local risk management institutions has diminished climate risk management options for most households. To build and employ alternate livelihood practices such as commercial agriculture and planting woodlots for charcoal production, smallholders must negotiate new institutions, a prerequisite for which is access to capitals (land, labor, and nonfarm income). Those without entitlements to these are pulled deeper into poverty with each successive climatic shock. This illustrates that adaptive capacity is not a static, quantifiable entity that exists in households. We argue that reconceptualizing adaptive capacity as a dynamic, social-environmental process that emerges in places can help clarify complex linkages among development policies, livelihoods, and adaptation pathways. To ensure more equitable and climate-resilient agricultural development, we stress the need to reformulate policies with careful attention to how power structures and entrenched social inequalities can lead to smallholders' uneven capacities to adapt to climate change.

Paradigm shifts in rangeland communities’ livelihoods activities as coping strategies to climate variability and restricted mobility,"A cross section exploratory study was conducted to understand the changes in livelihood strategies of rangeland communities in face of climate change and restricted mobility. Data collection relied on a mixed-method approach, including household surveys and rural rapid appraisals. Results indicated that agriculture is the main source of livelihood and households have a range of livelihood activities. Major coping strategies varied with production system and resource availability and access. Livestock species diversification), destocking and off-farm income engagement activities dominated livestock dominant system; while crop species diversification, shifting cropping calendars; use of improved varieties and establishment of food stores were the main strategies for the crop production system; whereas for mixed production system; species diversification, use of agrochemicals), use of improved breeds and crop varieties, engagement in off-farm activities prevailed. The perception of majority respondents was that mixed farming system improved household income and that land tenure reforms had led to: bureaucracies in acquisition of public land leases), forced sedentarization); livelihood insecurity, collapse of pastoral adaptation, poverty, resource use conflicts and hindrance to permanent developments. Results indicated the major constraints of transition in production systems were: livestock-crop conflicts, limited financial capital, low productivity of tolerant local breeds and varieties and lack of land for expansion. Findings point to the need for policies that enhance sustainable livelihood coping strategies and access to resources to increase the adaptive capacity to mitigate the adverse effects of climate variability and restricted mobility. There is need to redress strategies that threaten the environment and to promote integration of community best practices initiatives in proven modern concepts of adaptation to climate change and livelihood vulnerability. © 2018, Fundacion CIPAV.

Assessing Coping Strategies in Response to Drought: A Micro Level Study in the North-West Region of Bangladesh,"Drought is an extreme and frequent event in the north-west region of Bangladesh and it adversely affects the livelihood of the farming community. Identifying the coping strategies that farmers use in the face of drought is crucial in order to understand how farmers minimize the effects of drought on their production, especially in the face of climatic changes that may impact the occurrence of extreme weather events. The purpose of this study was to assess farmers' coping strategies for droughts by identifying which strategies are used and the influencing factors. A mixed methods approach using qualitative and quantitative data was employed. Preliminary data were collected using structured interviews and focus group discussions in which the findings were triangulated in order to design a questionnaire. The study respondents were 100 farmers operating in north-west Bangladesh. The findings were analyzed using descriptive statistics, coefficient of correlation, multiple linear and step-wise regressions. The results reveal that the respondents have limited drought coping strategies, even though the region is prone to frequent droughts. Among the fourteen identified drought coping strategies, the use of deep tube wells for irrigation water was the most widely reported and the farmers perceived it as the most important coping strategy. Shallow tube wells closely followed as the second most commonly used coping strategy reported by the respondents. Among the identified coping strategies, the least practiced was the use of treadle pumps. The findings from the study showed that age, education, farm size, annual family income, extension media contact, and organization participation were significantly associated with the choice of coping strategy that the farmers employed. Additionally, farm size, age, and education were identified as influential factors that affected the farmers' choice of which drought coping strategies to use. The study identified important issues for policy makers engaged with governmental programs that aim to enhance the farmers' drought coping mechanisms. The methods employed and the results of this study could be usefully applied in other districts of Bangladesh, or other areas of the world suffering from the negative effects of drought on agricultural production.",0.965407282466287,0.21051706976292403,0.06413177499869582,0.7027508022861898,0.006704797784864626,0.0088063322858387,0.09005216965693237
Adaptive livelihood strategies employed by farmers to close the food gap in semi-arid south eastern Zimbabwe,"Rural households in semi-arid areas of southern Africa are confronted with numerous hazards that threaten the household food base. The new wildlife policy of establishing transfrontier conservation areas aims to increase conservation of wildlife resources while improving local livelihoods. This policy can be better appreciated by local people if it embraces knowledge of the adaptive strategies they employ to close the food gap. We assessed how different households responded to the major hazard, drought, in order to gain insight into how these households addressed critical questions of food availability. Informal interviews, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were conducted to determine how households can be disaggregated according to their livelihood patterns and a questionnaire was applied to learn how each group responded to drought. Data were analysed within the three livelihood types that were identified and described at local level as cattle-based, crop-based and non-farm based. We found that factors that aggravated the effects of drought are specific to the different household types and their responses were also specific to that particular household type. Disaggregation of the livelihood types revealed within and between type relations and interactions that are important to people in order to cope. For example, even though cropping is an important activity across the three livelihood types, specifically in cattle and crop-based types, the non-farm type becomes important in restocking inputs after a serious drought through cross-border trading. Livestock and cross-border trading are important coping strategies for all three livelihood types, with the cattle-based trading cattle, the crop-based trading goats and poultry and the non-farm based linking with markets for trading livestock, drugs and restocked inputs for the cattle-based and crop-based groups. These linkages among livelihood types are important factors in reducing vulnerability to change that only become visible as a result of this disaggregation. We conclude that additional policies of enhancing the resilience of local food systems by stimulating across-border livestock trading and formal market set-up and enhancing systems of adaptation that are already in existence (e.g., crop production in the Banyeni) can add value to the success of transfrontier conservation areas in southern Africa.",0.93420455345919,0.2719653906082103,0.10741245678029128,0.6671489854516918,0.020039669296787965,0.014458240337453188,0.03877693931317392

"Adaptation to climate variability among the coffee farmers of the watersheds of the rivers Porce and Chinchiná, Colombia","This article seeks to explain the practices used by small farmers to cope with climate variability and extreme weather events in the basins of the Chinchiná and Porce rivers located on the central Andes in Colombia. The information wasglacie collected through interviews, observations on farms and workshops with farmers. Additionally historical averages on temperature, precipitation and sunshine were compared with those values recorded in 2010 during the transition between El Niño an La Niña events. During the first quarter of 2010 the average temperature in Chinchiná increased by 1.4 C° and the solar brightness by 14%, while the precipitation experienced a 46% reduction. In contrast, during the second half of the year there was a decrease of 0.8 C° in temperature, a 31% reduction in solar brightness and an increase in precipitation of 62%. The coffee production in the years 2011 and 2012 was the lowest in the country in the last 35 years despite the cultivated area increased. These changes affected the coffee plantations and substantially decreased grain coffe production. Coffee production in the years 2011 and 2012 was the lowest in the country in the last 35 years despite the cultivated area increase. These fall in coffee production was also a result of the renewal with rust resistant varieties, which at that time had not yet begun to produce. Most of the farmers have 5 hectares or less and are union members in the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia (FNCC), which provides multiple services to them including an extension service with spread of the findings of field investigations carried out by the National Coffee Research Center (CENICAFE). These study results indicates some strategies used by peasants to minimize the effects of climate variability: the shade management in coffee plantations, especially with banana (Musa sp.) and guamo (Inga sp); their renewal with the rust resistant variety named Castillo; the association of crops, particularly coffee, maize and bean; the use of mulches, organic fertilizers and mycorrhizae; a proper fertilization; the cultivation of two-axis coffee plants; the staggered planting of coffee in different plots and the reforestation of hillsides and births water, especially with (Guadua angustifolia), are strategies used to minimize the effects of climate variability. However these strategies are more frequent in Porce than in Chinchiná where sun coffee plantations and intensive agriculture are predominants. The article indicates that adaptation to climate variability is not achieved only by technological measures if do not decrease the sources of vulnerability of the rural population. The farmers are more exposed to the effects of weather because of their poverty, as a result of building on steep slopes, by cause of the volatility in the international price of coffee, by virtue of the exchange rate, due to the lack of a culture of crop insurance and for the lack of generational renewal in agriculture. Additionally peasants in Chinchiná faced threats of earthquakes, eruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano, susceptibility of volcanic soils to mass removals and glacier melting, an increasingly process accelerated by climate change. This paper also highlights the social, economic and political adaptation strategies to climate variability. We found that the resilience of rural households increases when resorting to agrotourism, integration of family labor, associations, political mobilization for claiming benefits, casual wage labor on other farms, integration to fair markets coffee and coffee certifications that increase the price of This work also highlights the social, economic and political adaptation strategies to climate variability. We found that the resilience of rural households increases when resorting to the agrotourism, integration of family labor, the union associations, political mobilization for claiming benefits, the casual wage labor on other farms, the integration to fair markets of coffee and coffee certifications that increase the price of grain of coffee grain. Not all spontaneous adaptation measures are positive, it is necessary to evaluate the experience of many coffee farms of medium length that were converted to livestock, rural tourism and citrus growing. Since climate change and climate variability has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, this work also helps to identify vulnerabilities and adaptation of rural populations to climate change and extreme events.",0.9503736028077936,0.2290686460360832,0.07616913564560865,0.5841419111730421,0.015483747007548404,0.023292850634422473,0.06436202287433769
Farmers' Perceptions about Adaptation Practices to Climate Change and Barriers to Adaptation: A Micro-Level Study in Ghana,"This study analyzed the farmer-perceived importance of adaptation practices to climate change and examined the barriers that impede adaptation. Perceptions about causes and effects of long-term changes in climatic variables were also investigated. A total of 100 farmer-households were randomly selected from four communities in the Lawra district of Ghana. Data was collected using semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussions (FGDs). The results showed that 87% of respondents perceived a decrease in rainfall amount, while 82% perceived an increase in temperature over the past 10 years. The study revealed that adaptation was largely in response to dry spells and droughts (93.2%) rather than floods. About 67% of respondents have adjusted their farming activities in response to climate change. Empirical results of the weighted average index analysis showed that farmers ranked improved crop varieties and irrigation as the most important adaptation measures. It also revealed that farmers lacked the capacity to implement the highly ranked adaptation practices. The problem confrontation index analysis showed that unpredictable weather, high cost of farm inputs, limited access to weather information, and lack of water resources were the most critical barriers to adaptation. This analysis of adaptation practices and constraints at farmer level will help facilitate government policy formulation and implementation.",0.9434644018290743,0.1554298342279828,0.06180808701555043,0.5582018185233936,0.03760825840191078,0.02410565868059972,0.04564436864118713
"Shifting from apple to peach farming in Kazuno, northern Japan: perceptions of and responses to climatic and non-climatic impacts","Apple farmers in Kazuno, northern Japan, have started to grow peaches in the northernmost climatic region suitable for peach farming. Here, we investigate the process from the initial introduction of peach cultivation to its diffusion focusing on the farmers' perceptions of climatic and non-climatic stimuli and their actions to respond to these stressors. Interviews with the farmers identified three distinct groups. Four farmers (Group 1) initiated the transition to peach production, which then spread to other farmers (Group 2) via personal connections. Later, after the provision of various means of support from the local government and the producers' cooperative, many more apple farmers (Group 3) decided to begin peach production. Most farmers recognized the risk of damages to apple production as a result of typhoons and drought. However, only Group 1 farmers, who depend on direct sales to customers, mentioned these climate-related damages as a reason to shift toward peach cultivation in order to maintain their customers. The peach fruit was specifically chosen as a replacement for apple because it is less vulnerable to these climatic stressors. For Group 3 farmers, the financial losses associated with these climate-related events could be compensated for by insurance. Their decision to grow peach is largely due to its higher price and immunity against a specific disease which affects apples but they only shifted once institutional support was available, thereby reducing the risk in cultivating a new species. Our findings suggest that the role of institutions was not to drive the process of the adaptation itself but rather to provide relevant support to farmers to enable them to shift to new crop varieties more easily. We argue that such process-based understanding is crucial in formulating strategies to increase adaptive capacity in agriculture.",0.9631893982024469,0.20388456793222956,0.061322857452442286,0.47368288949364074,0.02706329650855535,0.02104244750376353,0.054452252316430624
Coping with the impacts of weather changes in rural Sierra Leone,"Global changes in climate today present hostile weather conditions which pose considerable threats to the rich and poor alike. The capacity for developing countries to cope with these impacts is weak and a development concern. The post-conflict West African nation of Sierra Leone is no exception. In fact, rural areas are exposed to high degrees of vulnerability, livelihood insecurity and hostile environments. This paper explores the experiences of rural people and identifies impacts and coping mechanisms used in response to these changes. The research on which this paper is based adopted a facilitated group discussion approach involving 250 participants drawn from five rural settlements in Kambia and Kono Districts of Sierra Leone. In safeguarding rural livelihoods and ensuring environmental protection, this paper concludes with a number of policy recommendations, including the provision of external support, enforcing land tenure arrangements, strengthening rural people's resilience and encouraging collective and adaptive environmental management practices.",0.5349022283251409,0.4021420179402316,0.11910908834980746,0.6181370004459356,0.08267779989148413,0.08312525160429851,0.12499039662737874
"Coping with climate change and its impact on productivity, income, and poverty: Evidence from the Himalayan region of Pakistan","The current study explores the climate-risk mitigating strategies adopted by farmers and their impact on household income, poverty levels and wheat yield in the Himalayan region of Pakistan. This study is based on a primary dataset collected from 500 farmers through a field survey from the seven districts of the Himalayan region of northern Pakistan: Ghizer, Gilgit, Diamer, Astore, Skardu, Ghance, and Hunza-Nagar. A multivariate probit was employed to estimate the determinants of choice of adaptation strategies by farmers and a propensity score matching approach was used to estimate the impact of coping strategies on wellbeing. The most common climate-risk management strategies adopted at farm level include an adjustment in the sowing time, adoption of resistant varieties, tree plantation, non-farm participation as well as crop-livestock interaction. The impact of all these risk-management strategies was estimated individually as well as jointly. The empirical results indicated that farmers with higher levels of education and secured land rights mostly adopt more climate-risk mitigating strategies. The overall PSM results show that household income levels are high (in the range of PKR 1658-2610 per month), indicating that those households adopting climate-risk management strategies have higher income levels. The ATT results for the wheat yield are in the range of 42-65 kg per hectare, indicating that farmers adopting climate-risk management strategies have higher wheat yields. The ATT results for poverty are negative and significant, indicating that households adopting climate-risk management strategies have lower poverty levels (in the range of 2-4%). Increasing public awareness and supporting households in risk-mitigating strategies in the Himalayan region could be a crucial policy measure in reducing vulnerability to climate change, thereby increasing wellbeing.",0.932945852580676,0.1908369871188712,0.07276989524801526,0.5500060724647686,0.01639293844225715,0.036964974668251285,0.03456710437139433
Staple Food Diversification Versus Raskin: Developing Climate Change Resilience in Rural Indonesia,"This study investigates the role of Raskin, a rice subsidy policy for poor consumers, in supplementing the consumption of local staple foods and climate change resiliency. On-site surveys and interviews were conducted in three villages within three districts in Java Island, namely Banjamegara, Gunungkidul, and Sleman. Analysis with two-stage least square (2SLS) estimation on the survey data suggests that higher amounts of Raskin rice received by households are associated with more consumption of non-rice staple foods in Banjamegara and Gunungkidul. Interestingly, qualitative data reveal that the communities still uphold the value of consuming local staples, that is, maize and cassava, yet they admit that rice consumption is more prevalent today. The key factor shaping this change in consumption is the Raskin policy. The article closes with a discussion of the implications for rural policy, in Indonesia and beyond.",0.6569622324672404,0.331786133625959,0.09677908539802924,0.38112569926361506,0.07458230021734726,0.06830779900599397,0.06087445645713062
Effect of climate variability on crop income and indigenous adaptation strategies of households,"Purpose This study aims to examine the effect of climate variability on smallholders' crop income and the determinants of indigenous adaptation strategies in three districts (Mieso, Goba-koricha and Doba) of West Hararghe Zone of Ethiopia. These three districts are located in high-moisture-stress areas because of crop season rainfall variability. Design/methodology/approach Primary data collected from 400 sample households were used for identifying factors that affect households' crop income. The study used ordinary least square (OLS) regression to examine the effect of climate variability. Given this, binary logit model was used to assess smallholders' adaptation behavior. Finally, the study used multinomial logistic regression to identify determinants of smallholders' indigenous adaptation strategies. Findings The OLS regression result shows that variability in rainfall during the cropping season has a significant and negative effect, and cropland and livestock level have a positive effect on farmers' crop income. The multinomial logistic regression result reveals that households adopt hybrid crops (maize and sorghum) and dry-sowing adaptation strategies if there is shortage during the cropping season. Variability in rainfall at the time of sowing and the growing are main factors in the area's crop production. Cropland increment has positive and significant effect on employing each adaptation strategy. The probability of adopting techniques such as water harvesting, hybrid seeds and dry sowing significantly reduces if a household has a large livestock. Originality/value The three districts are remote and accessibility is difficult without due support from institutions. Thus, this study was conducted on the basis of the primary data collected by the researchers after securing grant from Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA).",0.9564388374672029,0.21043535951120151,0.07049468155213091,0.6691751662224247,0.018282993412513666,0.02196433244617393,0.017564924721439227
Small scale farmers' vulnerability to climatic changes in southern Benin: the importance of farmers' perceptions of existing institutions,"Farmers in rural Africa use a number of adaptive strategies to cope with observed climatic changes and their impacts on agriculture. Most studies on adaptive capacity focus on socio-economic parameters (such as poverty or education), and few provide detailed analysis on the role played by different institutions at local level, and the effects of how these institutions are perceived on farmers' adaptation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 46 households from seven villages in southern Benin (West Africa), and among representatives of several institutions at the local level. Half the participants were involved in Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) development projects and half were independent farmers. Results indicate that independent farmers mostly use non-agricultural coping strategies (loans, work in town) while project farmers mainly use agricultural adaptive strategies (improved seed varieties). Lack of adaptive capacity of independent farmers is linked to weak State institutions at the local level. Due to their lack of efficiency and high corruption rates, local State representatives are mistrusted. NGOs are trusted and seek for help, even by independent farmers. Even if NGOs do not have climate change adaptation in their agendas, they promote activities, which help reduce farmers' vulnerability. Although our results are limited to south-western Benin, they question the way adaptation is promoted today, for instance through the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (through the National Adaptation Programmes of Action).",0.9253939355359864,0.23838936204857983,0.09812666947344374,0.5959954154423012,0.03717227756073911,0.022603765754304946,0.058538296601159834
"Climate Change Awareness and Adaptations Among the Farming and Animal Rearing Communities of the Central Sokoto Close-Settle Zone, North-Western Nigeria","General consensus almost exists amongst scholars across many fields that climate change is a reality, its impacts are already with us and no part of the world or group of people are immune from its impacts. In facts, during recent decades scholars are busy assessing its impact now and in the foreseeable future. Within the fragile dryland ecosystem of Sokoto in the North-western part of Nigeria, some of the immediate impacts of climate change includes declining rainfall, increasing temperature and extreme weather events such as droughts, severe windstorms, heat waves and flooding among others. These presents some serious threats to both the natural ecosystem and people depending on the ecosystem for their livelihood particularly crop farmers and livestock pastoralists that constitutes over 70% of the inhabitant of the area. Under this kind of situation, the need for increasing awareness about the causes, impacts, mitigation and adaptation to climate change cannot be over emphasised particularly among farmers and herdsmen due to the high sensitivity of their livelihood sources to climate change. Using a semi-structured questionnaire with both open and close ended questions and simple statistical techniques, this research tries to investigate the level of climate change awareness and adaptation strategies among farmers and herdsmen in the Sokoto Close-settled Zone of North-western Nigeria. The result revealed a fair level of awareness of climate change particularly amongst the youth in the area. Some climate change adaptation strategies in the area and their implications were also discussed while recommendations on the way forward provided.",0.7287089125954798,0.3088096251331757,0.11546438928432644,0.3970883522429295,0.04020988988501849,0.05251534070979649,0.03494206372492914
Markets and climate are driving rapid change in farming practices in Savannah West Africa,"Agricultural practices have constantly changed in West Africa, and understanding the factors that have driven the changes may help guide strategies to promote sustainable agriculture in the region. To contribute to such efforts, this paper analyzes drivers of change in farming practices in the region using data obtained from surveys of 700 farming households in five countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Senegal). The results showed that farmers have adopted various practices in response to the challenges they have faced during the last decade. A series of logit models showed that most changes farmers made to their practices are undertaken for multiple reasons. Land use and management changes including expanding farmed areas and using mineral fertilization and manure are positively related to perceived changes in the climate, such as more erratic rainfall. Planting new varieties, introducing new crops, crop rotation, expanding farmed area and using pesticides are positively associated with new market opportunities. Farm practices that require relatively high financial investment such as use of pesticides, drought-tolerant varieties and improved seeds were positively associated with the provision of technical and financial support for farmers through development projects and policies. Changes in markets and climate are both helping to promote needed changes in farming practices in West Africa. Therefore, policies that foster the development of markets for agricultural products, and improved weather- and climate-related information linked to knowledge of appropriate agricultural innovations in different environments are needed.",0.964733222386695,0.16804650821483474,0.07627534215826211,0.6239582658350239,0.02424759414093551,0.013116039777559296,0.024241457223139595
"Adaptation to climate change and variability: a case of direct seeded rice in Andhra Pradesh, India","Farmers, researchers and policy-makers are increasingly concerned about the potential impacts of climate change. Researchers are using various climate models to assess the impacts and identifying relevant alternative adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change. In India, rice is the major cereal crop grown and is influenced due to climate change and variability, inadequate water supply, labour shortage and methane emissions from rice ecosystems. This necessitates adoption action and upscaling of key adaption strategies like direct seeded rice (DSR) using validated data from rice growing areas in India. The study used experimental data of 2010-2014 and field survey data of DSR and non-DSR farmers collected during 2014. Results show that DSR method has incurred less tillage and labour costs by eluding puddling and transplantation by labour. Large-scale adoption of DSR was observed during 2012-2015 in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. This was mainly due to the delayed monsoon and water supply, reduction in cost of cultivation, capacity building of stakeholders and their active involvement in awareness and training programmes. The study has demonstrated that integrated extension approach in technology dissemination and scaling-out through stakeholder integration is crucial. However, a mission mode framework is needed for technology upscaling at system level.",0.8788720015308966,0.22572558298339823,0.1348361372947745,0.38383583009649347,0.043890932387856296,0.04341657479134924,0.10757969805752414
Soil water management practices (terraces) helped to mitigate the 2015 drought in Ethiopia,"While the benefits of soil water management practices relative to soil erosion have been extensively documented, evidence regarding their effect on yields is inconclusive. Following a strong El-Nifio, some regions of Ethiopia experienced major droughts during the 2015/16 agricultural season. Using the propensity scores method on a nationally representative survey in Ethiopia, this study investigates the effect of two widely adopted soil water management practices - terraces and contour bunds - on yields and assesses their potential to mitigate the effects of climate change. It is shown that at the national level, terraced plots have slightly lower yields than non terraced plots. However, data support the hypothesis that terraced plots acted as a buffer against the 2015 Ethiopian drought, while contour bunds did not. This study provides evidence that terraces have the potential to help farmer deal with current climate risks. These results can inform the design of climate change adaptation policies and improve targeting of soil water management practices in Ethiopia.",0.8627581390831727,0.2376845445266113,0.18020229257242337,0.3428890253025952,0.03402663514489993,0.05229835551458526,0.1291976034541172

Advancing climate-smart-agriculture in developing drylands: Joint analysis of the adoption of multiple on-farm soil and water conservation technologies in West African Sahel,"Water stress and soil infertility are the greatest constraining factors for higher agricultural productivity in drylands, prompting the current interest in soil and water conservation (SWC) practices in water constrained regions. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of challenges surrounding the adoption of SWC practices in these regions, we used a joint analysis framework combining both multivariate and ordered probit models to analyze adoption-decisions for eleven on-farm SWC practices. Our case study, involving 500 farmers from a representative West African Sahelian zone, revealed that although the adoption of SWC practices is widespread in the West African drylands, there is still an important potential to improve and upscale their specific adoption rates. Almost all farmers (99%) used at least one of the eleven practices considered in this study, whereas specific adoption rates ranged from 5% for contour vegetation barriers to 87% for manure application. More than 70% of the farmers used up to three practices only, and less than 30% used between four to nine practices. Many practices are interdependent, with some practices being complementary and others substitutable. The analysis of the determinants of the adoption and the intensity of adoption revealed that SWC practices are labor-, knowledge- and capital-intensive. We found that the major drivers of farmers' decisions to adopt, as well as to intensify the use of, most SWC practices are the presence of children (aged 6 to 14) in the household, land holding, land tenure, awareness and training on SWC and access to alternative- but non-agricultural labor constraining - cash sources such as remittance and cash farming. A higher number of migrating household members increases the probability of intensifying the use of SWC practices, but only when this is in line with the household's land endowment and labor needs for farm activities. This comprehensive study will be of significance for a finer understanding of SWC practices in West African Sahel. More generally, it will likely help policy makers to upscale the adoption of sustainable SWC practices for the advance of climate-smart agriculture in developing drylands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"The impacts of climate change on agriculture in developing countries: A case study of Oyo state, Nigeria","Farmer livelihoods and agricultural growth in many Sub-Saharan African countries are at risk due to climate change as it impacts on agricultural production and income. Furthermore, smallholder farmers are affected disproportionately as their sustenance is totally dependent on agriculture. This study explores smallholder farmers' understanding and perception of climate change as well as the coping strategies they are adopting. Information was gathered through structured questionnaires and household surveys in Ibarapa/Ibadan and Ogbomoso Agricultural Zones of Oyo State Nigeria. Results revealed that smallholder farmers perceive climate change as increased temperature, delayed onset of rain, and increased drought. The effects of climate change include longer periods of heat stress on crops, reduced crop yield, increased health hazards, discomfort at work, increased outbreaks of disease, and reduced soil fertility. Farmer responses linked to their perception of climate change include mixed cropping, bush fallowing, cover cropping, crop rotation, use of fertilizers, mulching, and the use of improved crop varieties. Additional responses in the study area included having other sources of income generation such as trading, transportation businesses, and crafts. Respondents are making efforts to adapt to climate change in various ways; however, it is recommended that more insight and awareness campaigns are carried out on effects of climate change, and coping strategies should be encouraged to enhance adaptive capacity and productivity, thus improving the livelihoods of smallholders. © Common Ground, Adeola Opeoluwa Alo, Richard Baines, John Conway, and Nicola Cannon, All Rights Reserved.",0.9661175169821024,0.17710663691733297,0.07844299333335131,0.5753735661950343,0.008048300536649917,0.011664327759268633,0.01343112556138353
Adaptation practices followed by dairy farmers under adverse climatic conditions in western dry region of India,"The investigation was conducted in western dry region of India utilizing a descriptive research design.

Adoption of Diversification for Risk Management in Vegetable Cultivation,"Risk and uncertainty are inherent characteristics of agricultural production system; farmers are confronted with various potential risks related to production, markets, and prices that affect their financial returns and overall welfare. A study was undertaken to analyze factors affecting adoption of crop diversification as a risk management strategy in vegetable cultivation. A logistic regression model was constructed and tested based on responses to a questionnaire from 556 vegetable growers from eight districts of Uttar Pradesh. About 80% of vegetable growers adopted crop diversification and comparatively younger, socially underserved farmers with lower income are more likely to adopt diversification as a risk mitigating tool. Use of high-yielding seed, volatility in temperature, high marketed surplus ratio, availability of market demand, arrangement of organized buyers, and adoption of processing techniques are most likely to influence adoption of diversification. A better understanding of adoption of diversification for risk management was obtained and how socioeconomic, farm-related, market, and climatic factors affect adoption of crop diversification. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0.9599181572945102,0.21370656612326772,0.0747358727878513,0.49242101424192936,0.02441705686454904,0.016077326245016618,0.020716223364309932

Adapting the current mass mobilization approach in Ethiopia to enhance its impact on sustainable land management: Lessons from the Sago-kara watershed,"This paper analyses the effect of an adapted - more participatory and more integrated - mass mobilization training approach on Ethiopian farmers' motivation to practice integrated farming and invest in Sustainable Land Management (SLM). It is based on the results of an experiment carried-out in the Sago-kara watershed in the Central highlands of Ethiopia, in which a group of 26 farmers received an adapted training at the start of the mass mobilization campaign in 2016, which aimed to strengthen farmers' knowledge and awareness about natural resource management, drought mitigation and integrated farm planning. One year later, both qualitative and quantitative data were collected through group discussions, field observations and household surveys. For the before-after comparison we used descriptive statistics to analyze the data; the with-without comparison (with a control group) differences were statistically tested at 1% and 5% probability levels. The results show that the adapted training approach enhanced awareness of farmers, created motivation for integrated farm management and fostered implementation of SLM practices in the field. Most interesting is that farmers who followed the training better plan for drought mitigation and are more aware of the possible effects of drought on their farming activities. The study concludes that the current mass mobilization approach in Ethiopia can have more impact on SLM if it would pay serious attention to: 1) creating awareness on the causes and effects of erosion and drought focusing on sustainability issues, 2) fostering farmers' intrinsic motivation to be good stewards of their land; 3) training in integrated farm planning, and 4) developing farm plans based on farmers' visions for resilient farming. In order to make agricultural extension in Ethiopia more effective, one has to start with capacity building of the rural extension staff in participatory training methods, followed by empowering and motivating farmers for SLM. This will not only lay a foundation for sustainable agriculture and more food security on the farm, but is also crucial for the scaling-up of resilient farming to watershed and landscape levels in Ethiopia.",0.9416170702366344,0.18719747676023069,0.0756017720592113,0.5104696523210495,0.024497964640509504,0.042143995277975035,0.09385596010874687
Farmers' perception to change and adaptation strategies of small ruminant systems in the West Bekaa of Lebanon,"Sheep and goats production in the MENA region faces economic, environmental and social pressures causing major shifts in the production systems. This study investigates the main constraints affecting small ruminant production in the West Bekaa of Lebanon as perceived by the farmers, and their reported adaptive strategies. Four semi-sedentary systems were identified i) with landless shepherds, small herds and access to crop residues, ii) with small herds and no access to crop residues, iii) with medium sized herds and access to crop residues and iv) with large herds. Farmers from all systems perceived production constraints as related to pasture access and quality (25% of reported answers), and climate variability (22.5% of reported answers). Market and political uncertainties (24.5% of reported answers), on-farm socio-economic conditions and animal health were also reported as production challenges. Systems with larger herds were more affected by fluctuations in market prices and labor cost than systems with small herds. In the absence of the government support, farmers from all systems developed short-term adaptive strategies which mainly involved more time spent on pastures (88% of farmers), more feed supplementation (67% of farmers supplemented an average of 1 kg of barley/animal/day), and a decrease in herd size (61% of farmers). Changing herd movement was also practiced but to a lesser extent due to restricted access to pastures and local policies. Small ruminant systems in the West Bekaa are becoming more sedentary under environmental pressures and market uncertainties as perceived by the farmers, while diversifying their coping strategies.",0.9762813354718082,0.20943143075438897,0.06924528453997683,0.5980856354093795,0.026965233211485088,0.011191308276713208,0.02157801322008224
"Farmer Perceptions of Climate Change, Observed Trends and Adaptation of Agriculture in Pakistan","Farmers' willingness and ability to adapt agricultural systems depend on their knowledge about changes in climate and perceived risks of extreme events. Using cross-sectional data of 450 farmers collected from three agro-ecological zones of Punjab, Pakistan, this study investigates farmer perceptions of climate change and their agreement with observed climatic trends. In addition, this study explores the correlation between different adaptation stages (perceptions, intentions, and adaptation) and their key drivers using a Multivariate Probit Model. This study also explores the adaptation measures adopted by farmers. The results of the study show that the perceptions of increasing mean temperature match well with locally recorded data. However, a discrepancy is found in some cases between farmer perceptions of rainfall changes and local climate records. Moreover, education, experience, land tenure, land holdings, extension, cooperation, access to weather forecasting, and marketing information are the factors influencing the three adaptation stages. A strong association is found among the three adaptation stages. Particularly, the study confirms the hypothesis that accurate perceptions lead to stronger adaptation intentions compared to underestimated or no perceptions. Further, farmers prefer basic adaptation measures including changing crop varieties, input use and planting dates over advanced measures, such as planting shade trees, soil conservation, and crop diversification. The study recommends providing farmers, especially small landholders and tenants, easy access to information, institutional services and training on the use of advanced measures to reduce negative impacts of climate change at the farm level.",0.9836517094943129,0.17179586468702027,0.056883610700732286,0.5,0.02940871596762866,0.012121989686199259,0.05583066656281844
"Cassava production as a climate change adaptation strategy in Chilonga Ward, Chiredzi District, Zimbabwe","This study sought to pilot a range of long-term adaptation measures in the agriculture sector because of climate change shocks. Past droughts in Zimbabwe have had devastating environmental and socio-economic impacts in rural areas where livelihoods mainly depend on agriculture. Over the past few years, many parts of Zimbabwe have been experiencing extreme events. The study sought to address the following objectives to describe smallholder farmers' knowledge of climate change variability and change in Chilonga Ward and to explore the potential of cassava production as a climate change adaptation strategy in Chiredzi. An assessment of the impact of cassava production on rural livelihoods as a climate change adaptation strategy was also done. Focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, desk research and observation were the tools used to collect data. The results show that cassava has an extensive root system that can penetrate poor soils which may not support crops like maize. Zimbabwe has to increase cassava production as its tubers can be value added to produce a range of products that include livestock feed and porridge.",0.8714007330675704,0.23802746552990117,0.08894758304855531,0.47683529847568656,0.038724961982896995,0.038504538421553665,0.05454671449626513
Strategies of Farmers in the Bawku West District of Ghana to Mitigate the Impacts of Climate Variability on Farming,"The livelihoods of the people of northern Ghana, particularly those in rural areas, depend to a large extent on agriculture. Farmers in these areas have noticed variations in the climate. Accordingly, they have formulated coping strategies to avoid substantial or complete losses in livestock and crop productivity. However, the extreme climatic variations in recent years have threatened the resilience of current adaptive strategies, and failures in crop and livestock productivity are on the rise. The inevitable changes predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other scientists demand an understating of the coping strategies of rural farmers and recent crop production in order to develop capacity-building programs for farmers. Field data was collected from 135 farmers and key informants in the Bawku West District using semi-structured questionnaires and checklists, and the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results indicate that farmers in the study area practice mixed farming with a current focus on the rearing of goats and poultry, the cultivation of new and improved crop varieties, and the planting of early-maturing crop varieties in flood-prone areas. The findings suggest that the capacities of farmers should be enhanced through the provision of reliable information on climatic variations and access to farm implements, farm inputs, irrigation facilities, and credit facilities to help farmers enhance productivity and engage in other income-generating activities.",0.9878319945200679,0.17452886260748363,0.061554229034340505,0.6793531623256146,0.027344592331729076,0.006879846499120942,0.015995840608754214
An adaptation strategy of sandland peasants in Yogyakarta toward climate change,"This study aims to explore and describe the adaptation strategies of sandland peasants toward climate change. Qualitative research method was employed and the data were collected through observation. In addition, the recording of the data, interview and the validity of data were determined by triangulation of sources. The results of the research showed that the adaptation strategies of sandland peasants toward climate change were; (1) the adjustment of crop varieties, (2) the utilization of productive crops as wind breaking, and (3) the irrigation system using ""sumur panthek"".",0.8603965081722551,0.27391717971448704,0.09749871097411207,0.5193356821598981,0.06109330184235318,0.04385161462211048,0.06014703809024889
"Requisite variety in adaptation strategies: case studies from two regions prone to climate change, Brandenburg, Germany and semi-arid Bekaa, Lebanon","Climate change has become a main driver for institutional change, prompting the need for comprehensive adaptation strategies and impacts assessment (Biesbroek et al. 2010; Elasha 2010). The agriculture sector is affected simultaneously by intertwined challenges that comprise ensuring food security, adaptation to changes in environmental conditions and contributing to climate change mitigation (FAO 2013; Parry et al. 2004). Berman et al. (2012) propose a framework for assessing institutional adaptation capacity by linking the two concepts of vulnerability and resilience. The objective of this study was to understand and describe defining elements of resilience in crop adaptation and agro-environmental management. Three case studies were conducted on local farmers' adaptation strategies across two regions identified with production systems subject to very different institutional and agro-ecological settings, but equally considered highly vulnerable to climate change. Complex implications are expected for the maintenance of food production in the traditionally agriculture based regions, with subsequent socio-economic effects. 1. Horticultural production: Due to strict regulations regarding chemical treatment, conventional and organic farmers who generally have limited possibilities to avoid infested sites are dependent on innovative measures for crop adaptation and soil treatment. 2. Large-scale organic farms: Production sites are facing decreased crop yields due to deficiencies in nitrogen supply due to low of farmyard manure and decrease of microbial nitrogen mineralization exacerbated by increasing pre summer droughts. 3. Agro-pastoral systems: Small ruminants production systems are managing environmental constraints by reducing overall flock size, reducing the movement to grazing sites and decreasing feed supplements. Herders are also diversifying their sources of income. Comparative analysis is conducted across case studies. Research questions address the role of local farmers' knowledge in contributing to requisite variety in local food production systems, existing measures for diversification at the farm level and provisions in case of failure in existing regional and national strategies.

Knowledge and passive adaptation to climate change: An example from Indian farmers,"This study is an attempt to use group information collected on climate change from farmers in eastern Uttar Pradesh, India to address a key question related to climate change policy: How to encourage farmers to adapt to climate change? First, we investigate farmers' perception of and adaptation to climate change using content analysis and group information. The findings are then compared with climatic and agriculture information collected through secondary sources. Results suggest that though farmers are aware of long-term changes in climatic factors (temperature and rainfall, for example), they are unable to identify these changes as climate change. Farmers are also aware of risks generated by climate variability and extreme climatic events. However, farmers are not taking concrete steps in dealing with perceived climatic changes, although we find out that farmers are changing their agricultural and farming practices. These included changing sowing and harvesting timing, cultivation of crops of short duration varieties, inter-cropping, changing cropping pattern, investment in irrigation, and agroforestry. Note that these changes may be considered as passive response or adaptation strategies to climate change. Perhaps farmers are implicitly taking initiatives to adapt climate change. Finally, the paper suggests some policy interventions to scale up adaptation to climate change in Indian agriculture. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Dynamic models of farmers adaptation to climate change (case of rice farmers in Cemoro Watershed, Central Java, Indonesia)","Farming activities are generally very sensitive to climate change variations. Global climate change will result in changes of patterns and distribution of rainfall. The impact of changing patterns and distribution of rainfall is the occurrence of early season shifts and periods of planting. Therefore, farmers need to adapt to the occurrence of climate change to avoid the decrease productivity on the farm land. This study aims to examine the impacts of climate change adaptation that farmers practiced on the farming productivity. The analysis is conducted dynamically using the Powersim 2.5. The result of analysis shows that the use of Planting Calendar and Integrated Crops Management technology can increase the rice productivity of certain area unity. Both technologies are the alternatives for farmers to adapt to climate change. Both farmers who adapt to climate change and do not adapt to climate change, experience an increase in rice production, time after time. However, farmers who adapt to climate change, increase their production faster than fanners who do not adapt to climate change.

Tackling everyday risks through climate adaptive organic farming,"Purpose With the shifting patterns of rain and dry periods as a result of global climate change, the people of Gunungkidul have to deal with extreme conditions, such as crop failure, ponds and artificial lakes drying up at an alarming rate due to high evaporation. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach Participatory disaster and risks assessment and action planning were carried out to identify how communities perceive risks and identify priorities of actions. Farmers agreed to implement climate adaptive farming which combines organic farming, biological pest control and drought-resistant seedlings from local varieties. Findings The processes to adaptation required collective actions, paradigm shift and it also constitutes trial and error processes. Acceptance to innovation is mostly one of the major challenges. Working with ""contact"" farmers and ""advance"" farmers is the key to the community organizing strategy for innovation and adaptation. Research limitations/implications - This case study is limited to the adaptation program funded by Indonesia Climate Change Trust Fund in four farmer groups in Purwosari Sub-District, GunungKidul district and Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. Practical implications - Trainings and direct assistance to climate adaptive farming have benefitted the farmers that they are able to increase the farming production and reduce the risk of crop failure. Social implications - The demonstration plot has strengthened farmer groups' social modalities by working together to shift from traditional into adaptive farming.

"Old wine, new bottles? Investigating the differential adoption of 'climate-smart' agricultural practices in western Kenya","This study assesses factors influencing the adoption of land management practices associated with a World Bank-financed project on' climate-smart' agriculture: the Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project. Drawing upon mixed-methods research with participating farmers in Bungoma County, western Kenya, we find modest reported adoption rates overall for project-encouraged practices, amounting to 53.6 percent on average. However, we also find that there are systematic differences in the reported adoption rates of individual practices. Disaggregating our sample into three classes or 'wealth groups', we find that the 'very poor' and 'poor' groups exhibit substantially lower adoption rates (42 percent and 49 percent, respectively) relative to the 'less poor' wealth group (73 percent). Across these groups, practices related to livestock management and pest management are systematically less adopted (0-45 percent) than more popular practices such as agroforestry and tillage management, the reported adoption of which both range from 60 to 80 percent. Consequently, we suggest that barriers to the adoption of apparently 'climate smart' agricultural practices at scale may increasingly be political-economic rather than simply technical-managerial in nature. This reflects the poorest strata of farmers' struggles to negotiate the increasingly externally imposed imperatives of climate adaptation and mitigation with the necessity of 'simple reproduction' or survival of the household as a socioeconomic unit. Future generations of 'climate smart' agricultural programmes may thus benefit from disaggregating adaptation and mitigation objectives in order to avoid unduly burdening the poorest strata of participating households in rural African contexts.

"ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE: IMPACT OF CAPACITY BUILDING, INDIA","Climate change adversely affects the determinants of agriculture. Adaptation serves as an important strategy to reduce the adverse effects of climate change (variability) and vulnerability of the people. Adaptation through an innovation programme was implemented for 4 years during 2012-2016 to improve the adaptive capacity in agriculture and the water sectors through capacity building and implementation in the Krishna River Basin, India. Primary data were collected from 178 farm households of the Nagarjuna Sagar Project command area covering both adopters and non-adopters of water-saving interventions from the study area. The double difference method was used to analyse the impact of adaptation through capacity building and implementation. The water-saving interventions include alternate wetting and drying (AWD) in rice, a modified system of rice intensification (MSRI) and direct seeding of rice (DSR). The capacity building and water saving increased crop yields by 0.96, 0.93 and 0.77 t ha(-1) through AWD, MSRI and DSR respectively. The three practices have increased farmers' income and decreased the cost of cultivation in DSR by Rs.11 000 (US$169) ha(-1). The methods can be more focused in canal commands on a larger scale for equal distribution of water to all the head, middle and tail-end regions.

How Farmers Deal with Water Scarcity in Community-Managed Irrigation SYSTEMS: A Case Study in Northern Tunisia,"Operating irrigation systems when water supplies are insecure is a critical challenge for both farmers and managers. The aim of this paper is to analyse how farmers adapt to water scarcity and to investigate to what extent individual farmers' practices affected the management of a community-managed irrigation system in an area with perennial citrus orchards in northern Tunisia. Results revealed a wide range of farmers' strategies and practices aimed at maximizing their access to surface water and groundwater according to their ability. But this resulted in increasing inequity, because the biggest farmers managed to access groundwater or practised drip irrigation, while the vulnerability of small farmers increased. In this context the introduction of drip irrigation has not led to water saving. These findings should encourage the adoption of fair collective rules that account for water scarcity and farmers' diversity.

"Vanishing Springs in Nepalese Mountains Assessment of Water Sources, Farmers' Perceptions, and Climate Change Adaptation","The Thulokhola watershed of the Nuwakot district in the midhills region of Nepal can be considered typical of climate change-related stresses in the region. To assess the status of water resources and document farmers' perceptions of and adaptation to climate change impacts in this watershed, we invited community groups to monitor water quality and conducted 6 focus group meetings, 3 participatory rural appraisals, and spring and household surveys in 2011 and 2012. Historical precipitation data from a nearby weather station and discharge data for the Tadi Khola, the nearest major river, were also analyzed. The spring survey results confirmed farmers' perceptions and showed that 73.2% of the springs used as water sources had a decreased flow and 12.2% had dried up over the past 10 or more years, as recognized by local residents. In response to the severe decline of precipitation and the drying up of springs, local communities have implemented some climate change adaptation measures, such as constructing water tanks at water sources, using pipes to transport drinking water, diverting water from other springs, digging deeper wells, and traveling farther to wash clothes and fetch drinking water. To enhance drinking water supplies and ensure the agricultural, ecological, and environmental integrity of the watershed, initiatives such as comprehensive research on springs and groundwater hydrology, a spring rejuvenation program, and community capacity building for water sustainability and climate change adaptation are suggested.",0.7597529814400266,0.23908505011903938,0.15899477058940054,0.299455473411419,0.03341242126349895,0.0661533882180333,0.951497947685842
Trees and rural households' adaptation to local environmental change in the central highlands of Ethiopia,"This study assesses the role of trees In adaptation strategies of rural house holds to local environmental change in the central highlands of Ethiopia. Change in tree cover was assessed by producing Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps using satellite remote sensing images, and household survey was conducted to generate socioeconomic data. The results show that tree cover has increased over the last 30 years, mostly in the form of eucalyptus woodlots around homesteads. Eucalyptus reportedly helps households pass through livelihood shocks and provide protection against negative effects of climate change and variability. Despite some concerns on the part of local agricultural experts that planting eucalyptus may affect future food production, farmers are converting their croplands into eucalyptus woodlots. We conclude that land use planning and proper allocation of land resource is important to improve local livelihoods while also supporting adaptation of communities to local environmental change in general and climate change in particular.",0.8807060531009498,0.2812675377117918,0.10096339257968374,0.528730892532968,0.05721574410298355,0.024700242780084574,0.03930751189686334
"Climate adaptation, institutional change, and sustainable livelihoods of herder communities in northern Tibet","The Tibetan grassland social-ecological systems are widely held to be highly vulnerable to climate change. We aim to investigate livelihood adaptation strategies of herder households and the types of local institutions that shaped those adaptation strategies. We examined the barriers and opportunities for strengthening adaptive capacity of local herder communities. We designed and implemented a household survey in the herder communities of northern Tibet. The survey results showed that migratory grazing has become less feasible. Storage, diversification, and market exchange have become the dominant adaptation strategies. The adaptation strategies of local herders have been reshaped by local institutional change. Local governmental and market institutions played the dominant roles in reshaping climate adaptation strategies. Although the present livelihood adaption strategies related to sedentary grazing have improved productivity and profitability of the herding livelihood, they have led to continuous deterioration of pastures. The local grazing system has become more and more dependent on artificial feeding and inputs from outside the grazing system. Purchasing forage has become one of the dominant adaptation strategies of local herder households. Multilevel regression modeling of this adaptation behavior showed that explanatory variables related to climate variability, household capital, and local institutional arrangements had statistically significant relationships with the adoption of this adaptation strategy. The results implies that building household capital and promoting the coordination among local governmental, market, and communal institutions are critical for strengthening adaptive capacity of the Tibetan herder communities.",0.823231111675346,0.3479199139273331,0.10429262218235409,0.6393449749398521,0.11615963313814424,0.03461163620127157,0.06650931692388086
Correlating drought conservation practices and drought vulnerability in a tropical agricultural system,"Recent droughts in Puerto Rico and throughout the Caribbean have emphasized the region's agricultural vulnerability to this hazard and the increasing need for adaptation mechanisms to support sustainable production. In this study, we assessed the geographic extent of agricultural conservation practices incentivized by US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and evaluated their large-scale contribution to drought adaptability. We identified concentrations of drought-related practices (e.g. cover crops, ponds) applied between 2000 and 2016. Using information from spatial databases and interviews with experts, we assessed the spatial correlation between these practices and areas exposed to drought as identified by the US Drought Monitor. Between 2000 and 2016, Puerto Rico experienced seven drought episodes concentrated around the south, east and southeastern regions. The most profound drought occurred between 2014 and 2016 when the island experienced 80 consecutive weeks of moderate drought, 48 of severe drought and 33 of extreme drought conditions. A total of 44 drought-related conservation practices were applied at 6984 locations throughout 860 km(2) of farmlands between 2000 and 2016 through the NRCS-Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Practices related to water availability were statistically clustered along the coasts, whereas soil and plant health practices were clustered in the mountainous region. While these concentrations strongly correlated with areas exposed to moderate drought conditions, >80% did not coincide with areas that experienced severe or extreme drought conditions, suggesting that areas highly exposed to drought conditions generally lacked drought preparedness assisted by EQIP. Climate projections indicate an increase in the frequency and intensity of drought events, particularly in the eastern region of Puerto Rico. Our analysis highlighted the need to implement more conservation practices in these areas subject to drought intensification and exposure. Government programs intended to address vulnerabilities and enhance capacity and resilience may not be reaching areas of highest exposure. Recommendations include raising producer awareness of past and future exposure and making programs more accessible to a broader audience.",0.9159403688909619,0.29466317960953103,0.11587721726041778,0.3409314954744943,0.025149627498213756,0.036637631550327385,0.39520008951749236
Climate Events and Impact on Cropping Activities of Small-Scale Farmers in a Part of Southwest Nigeria,"The study examined the variations of selected climatic variables (rainfall and temperature) and the perceptions of small-scale farmers on the effects of extreme climate condition on cropping activities in the rain forest ecological region in southwest Nigeria. The area is characterized by three different subecological strata (the mountainous Akoko region in the north, the southern coastal area, and the middle, relatively lowland and more urbanized area) whose effects on the climate are made explicit in the relatively different values of the climate variables. Analysis of the responses to questions on perceptions of extreme climate effects indicated that about 70% of the farmers were aware of the effects of extreme climate events on crop production and yield, and over 50% indicated that too early rainfall, late rainfall, prolonged dryness after an initial rainfall, excessive rainfall, and windstorms were the common weather-related causes of low crop yields. More than 76% of the farmers changed planting dates and diversified their crops as mitigation measures, while about 72% adopted mulching and intercropping as adaptation strategies against extreme weather conditions. Only less than 20% had access to government support facilities and modern infrastructure. The study concluded that although the farmers respond to variable and extreme climate events in the study area, the responses, being not adequately supported by adequate farming infrastructure, do not guarantee sustainable food security in the region.",0.9622852011967082,0.1638071005478333,0.058054886623119153,0.560835285274083,0.04658804610638108,0.012896935899775669,0.03730190054113171
"Optimizing yield of improved varieties of millet and sorghum under highly variable rainfall conditions using contour ridges in Cinzana, Mali","Background: Low productivity of cereals, the staple food, in Sahelian zone of Cinzana in Mali is caused by a range of factors including but not limited to inherent low soil fertility, and insufficient and inadequate distribution of the rainfall due to high climate variability. In addition, the small amount of rain falls as heavy storms in very short periods of time leading to water losses by runoff which in turn causes a lot of erosion. The two phenomena therefore call for a combination of both strategic (combating erosion) and tactical (coping with inter- and intra-annual rainfall variability) measures to cope with the production uncertainties in such risk-prone environment. As opposed to most farmers' practice of using the same variety, a tactical solution of using varieties of different cycles for different rainfall amounts/patterns was thought to be worth testing. Varieties of different cycles for different rainfall amounts/patterns were combined with a well-known soil and water conservation practice which is the contour ridge tillage (CRT). The combined effects of the two measures on the production of different varieties of sorghum and millet as well as on soil water content were assessed in on-farm participatory trials in five villages. The experiment was run during three consecutive years (2012, 2013 and 2014). Results: A key finding of this research is that regardless of the yearly rainfall amount and provided CRT is used, there were large differences in yields between improved varieties and local ones. This is a result of higher soil water conservation and better response of the improved varieties. Conclusion: The use of CRT increases considerably the yields of improved varieties of the most important staple crops of the Cinzana commune which are millet and sorghum. Thus, the use of these early maturing improved varieties, along with CRT, could be an accessible adaptation strategy to climate variability by farmers. © 2017 The Author(s).",0.9061488563708257,0.18044595406661015,0.0898216976370671,0.47956329221363503,0.026682790441175018,0.036328044429841846,0.13353774925246584
Increasing resilience of smallholder farmers to climate change through multiple adoption of proven climate-smart agriculture innovations. Lessons from Southern Africa,"Conservation agriculture, drought tolerant maize, and improved legume varieties are key climate change management strategies for smallholder farmers in southern Africa. Their complementary efforts in adaptation to climate change are sternly important for farm productivity and income. This study evaluates factors explaining individual and multiple adoption of climate change management strategies and their differential impacts on productivity and income using a sample of 1172 smallholder farmers from Malawi and Zimbabwe. The study employs multinomial logistic regression to evaluate factors of individual and multiple adoption and regression adjustment with inverse probability weighting to evaluate impacts of the different adoption regimes on farm productivity and income. The results show that multiple adoption of innovations is mostly explained by access to key resources (credit, income and information), level of education and size of land owned by the farmer. More so, the concurrent adoption of conservation agriculture, stress adapted legume varieties and drought tolerant maize has far greater dividends on productivity and income than when considered individually. However, impacts of multiple adoption of the practices are not entirely uniform across different geographic regions and gender. Results suggest that effective institutional and policy efforts targeted towards reducing resource constraints that inhibit farmers' capacity to adopt complementary climate-smart agriculture packages such as conservation agriculture, drought tolerant maize and improved legume varieties must be gender sensitive and context specific.",0.9811871690292351,0.15799536460507732,0.11435869555521185,0.6634952320177445,0.016218853518981093,0.013354736892420154,0.03437154122414619
Crop adaptation processes to extreme floods in Bangladesh: a case study,"This paper investigates farmers' crop adaptation processes in response to three recent devastating floods in Islampur, a case-study area in rural Bangladesh. The paper reports a multi-method research project which comprised a questionnaire survey, focus-group discussions and interviews with agricultural block supervisors. The author analyses three recent severe floods in Bangladesh, occurring in 1988, 1995 and 1998, and reviews the adaptation techniques and strategies embraced by the same group of farmers in order to survive the more devastating inundations that occur from time to time. The study concluded that vulnerable farmers are highly resilient and, with appropriate support, their adjustments can be sustainable. This enquiry showed that in the face of climate change both the inclusion of autonomous adaptations into planning and policy-making and the enhancement and support of community-based adaptation can be effective in ensuring the survival of riverine farming systems. This case study can be considered as a key reference case in regard to vulnerable locations in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna mega-delta basin, particularly in respect to Bangladesh.",0.6916526658531463,0.32118122327904886,0.09072091349730411,0.5380527454202927,0.08772751834912497,0.07841126956104573,0.117732884506493
Factors linked with adaptation in the Indian marine fishing community,"Understanding the factors associated with adaptation can be crucial for building community adaptive-capacity. This study aims to provide a country-level assessment of some of the factors driving adaptation responses in marine fishing, and is based on data from 2564 villages and 66 districts along the coastline of India. Mechanization, usage of Global Positioning System (GPS) and diversification are important adaptation responses in the community. This study employs an analytical framework to understand three types of factors influencing adaptation: vulnerability/risk, difference in the macro environment and community-level factors (human, economic and social capitals, such as education, poverty and cooperative membership). The results indicate that the different factors are not uniformly associated with the adaptation responses. Regions which are vulnerable and face greater cyclone risk have low adaptation. The macro-environment of the state as well as support through cooperatives can play a role in adaptation. The results also highlight the importance of higher levels of education for adaptation responses, such as, using advanced navigation technology (GPS) and diversifying into other professions. The study provides useful insights regarding the factors linked with adaptation responses in the community and can be helpful for designing interventions. The paper can complement findings from regional studies and emphasizes the need for future rigorous research on adaptation in marine fishing.",0.43625732416654894,0.44300375875594017,0.13191539917600864,0.34393046309307546,0.284173455376909,0.0929563907146752,0.1979733126959216
Crop modelling: towards locally relevant and climate-informed adaptation,"A gap between the potential and practical realisation of adaptation exists: adaptation strategies need to be both climate-informed and locally relevant to be viable. Place-based approaches study local and contemporary dynamics of the agricultural system, whereas climate impact modelling simulates climate-crop interactions across temporal and spatial scales. Crop-climate modelling and place-based research on adaptation were strategically reviewed and analysed to identify areas of commonality, differences, and potential learning opportunities to enhance the relevance of both disciplines through interdisciplinary approaches. Crop-modelling studies have projected a 7-15% mean yield change with adaptation compared to a non-adaptation baseline (Nature Climate Change 4:1-5, 2014). Of the 17 types of adaptation strategy identified in this study as place-based adaptations occurring within Central America, only five were represented in crop-climate modelling literature, and these were as follows: fertiliser, irrigation, change in planting date, change in cultivar and area cultivated. The breath and agency of real-life adaptation compared to its representation in modelling studies is a source of error in climate impact simulations. Conversely, adaptation research that omits assessment of future climate variability and impact does not enable to provide sustainable adaptation strategies to local communities so risk maladaptation. Integrated and participatory methods can identify and reduce these sources of uncertainty, for example, stakeholder's engagement can identify locally relevant adaptation pathways. We propose a research agenda that uses methodological approaches from both the modelling and place-based approaches to work towards climate-informed locally relevant adaptation.",0.5699687977383614,0.33819781869565285,0.142639586743914,0.3665246609748999,0.09759210863910862,0.0741946669688808,0.11118796961270173
"Impact of drought tolerant maize adoption on maize productivity, sales and consumption in rural Zimbabwe","Increased frequency of droughts (especially mid-season dry spells), higher than normal temperatures and altered patterns of precipitation and intensity are some of the extreme weather events evident in southern Africa. These extreme weather events present a threat to livelihoods and sustainability of agricultural production in the region. However, several climate-smart agricultural technologies (including drought-tolerant maize) believed to offer adaptation to climate variability in maize-based farming systems have been widely adopted. Moreover, empirical work on these technologies is limited. This paper demonstrates how by adopting drought-tolerant maize, a climate-smart agricultural technology impacts on the quantities of maize produced, sold and consumed in Zimbabwe. Using primary data on smallholder farmers collected in 2011 in Zimbabwe's four districts, we employed propensity score matching techniques to construct a suitable comparison group and calculate the average treatment effect on the treated sample. We find that, the adoption of drought-tolerant maize (DTM) in rural Zimbabwe significantly enhances overall maize productivity and consequently the quantities set aside for sale and personal household consumption. Our study therefore suggests that, systematic expansion of climate-smart agricultural technologies such as adoption of drought-tolerant maize can significantly improve maize yields, sales and consumption in rural Zimbabwe. Our empirical results, robust to sensitivity checks, strongly point to the overall importance of DTM adoption in Zimbabwe. The findings from this paper also have very important implications for overall efforts on the promotion of climate-smart agriculture technologies in Africa and other developing countries.",0.9722079324729106,0.20415077066057785,0.08021085429555136,0.629471484041229,0.008596705248073962,0.014432550188044365,0.059336776339511774
Climate change and Chinese farmers: Perceptions and determinants of adaptive strategies,"Farmers' perceptions, beliefs, adaptive strategies, and barriers regarding climate change are critical to promoting sustainable ecosystems and societal stability. This paper is based on an extensive survey of 1 500 farmers and their households in Henan Province in China during 2013-2014. Henan is the largest agricultural province in China with over 51 million farmers. The survey results showed that approximately 57% of the respondents perceived the direct impact of climate change during the past 10 years, with 70.3% believing that climate change posed a risk to their livelihood. Not surprisingly, most farmers reported that they have adopted new measures to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. The main barriers hindering farmers' adopting adaptation measures were lack of funds and timely information. A multinomial logit model revealed that land ownership, knowledge of crop variety and the causes of climate change, as well as the belief of climate change, were all positively related to the likelihood of employing adaptive strategies. Moreover, the percentage of households engaging in agriculture activity, and years of engaging in farming were both negatively correlated with famer's likelihood of adopting adaptation strategies. More importantly, farmers with high incomes were less likely to adopt adaptive strategies and more willing to engage in other business activities. In conclusion, it is important to communicate climate change related information and government policies in rural areas, promote farmer associations and other educational outreach efforts to assist Chinese farmers to deal with climate change.",0.967995995332756,0.16542215576009603,0.05846556519805419,0.48710400371014745,0.026880378492480518,0.013001854215592438,0.024166092026315315
Limits of pastoral adaptation to permafrost regions caused by climate change among the Sakha people in the middle basin of Lena River,"This article focuses on the pastoral practices of the Sakha people in eastern Siberia to explore the impact of climate change on human livelihood in permafrost regions. Sakha use grassland resources in river terraces and the alaas thermokarst landscape for cattle-horse husbandry. Although they practice a different form of subsistence than other indigenous arctic peoples, such as hunter gatherers or reindeer herders, the adaptation of Sakha has been relatively resilient in the past 600-800 years. Recent climate change, however, could change this situation. According to hydrologists, increased precipitation is now observed in eastern Siberia, which has resulted in the increase of permafrost thawing, causing forests to die. Moreover, local meteorologists report an increase of flooding in local rivers. How do these changes affect the local pastoral adaptation? While describing recent uses of grassland resource by local people, and their perception of climate change through anthropological field research, I investigated the subtle characteristics of human-environment interactions in pastoral adaptation, in order to identify the limits of adaptation in the face of climate change.

Smallholder farmer cropping decisions related to climate variability across multiple regions,"A long history of household-level research has provided important local-level insights into climate adaptation strategies in the agricultural sector. It remains unclear to what extent these strategies are generalizable or vary across regions. In this study we ask about three potential key factors influencing farming households' ability to adapt: access to weather information, household and agricultural production-related assets, and participation in local social institutions. We use a 12-country data set from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to explore the links between these three potential drivers of agricultural change and the likelihood that farmers made farm-associated changes, such as adopting improved crop varieties, increasing fertilizer use, investing in improved land management practices, and changing the timing of agricultural activities. We find evidence that access to weather information, assets, and participation in social institutions are associated with households that have reported making farming changes in recent years, although these results vary across countries and types of practices. Understanding these drivers and outcomes of farm-associated changes across different socio-economic and environmental conditions is critical for ongoing dialogues for climate-resilient strategies and policies for increasing the adaptive capacity of smallholders under climate change.

How smallholder farmers adapt to agricultural drought in a changing climate: A case study in southern China,"Although the adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers to climate change and its attendant hazards have attracted widespread attention, the quantitative detection and evaluation of their adaptive behaviors remains a difficult task that deserves further study. This article describes an empirical case study performed in southern China to examine the adaptation strategies of paddy farmers to agricultural drought. We collected first-hand data through household questionnaires, in-depth interviews with local managers, and farm-level land-use surveys. The effectiveness of the adaptation approaches of the farmers was assessed in terms of the ecological, economic, and social benefits. Our findings indicate that over the past three decades, when confronted with recurrent seasonal drought in a warming climate, farmers have gradually abandoned the double-cropping rice production and transformed their cropping patterns into a new diversified mode of ""Rice-Cole, rice, cotton, seedling nursery, and coarse cereals"". Current farming practice reduces the vulnerability of local agriculture to drought, and allows farmers to diversify and improve their incomes, which contributes to enhanced resilience and adaptability to drought. However, the autonomous adaptation of farmers may primarily serve their interests of minimizing drought risk and maximizing economic profits but could also undermine the social benefits, such as regional grain security. A robust adaptation strategy should balance the ecological and economic benefits with social interests to maintain agricultural sustainability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Local adaptation strategies in semi-arid regions: study of two villages in Karnataka, India","Rural people in India, particularly farmers, are exposed to climate variability and risk, which is likely to increase due to climate change. This study assessed current adaptation strategies adopted by rural households in two dryland villages of Bagepalli Block, Chikballapur district, Karnataka, in southern India. The adequacy of adaptation strategies was also assessed. The study showed that rural households, and farmers in particular, adopted several practices to cope with current climate risks which include irrigation provisioning (depending on groundwater), shifting cropping pattern (to more resilient but low economically valued crops and varieties), mixed cropping, agroforestry (as a long-term strategy), diversified livestock holdings, and reliance on government development programmes. The adaptation measures also included leaving croplands fallow, sale of assets such as livestock and trees, and migration. Current climate-related responses to agricultural distress are not adequate to cope with even existing climate risks. This further indicates that rural households may not be able to cope with increasing climate variability and climate change. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand current adaptation strategies and to enhance resilience, and to develop structured adaptation strategies to cope with the risks associated with current and long-term climate change.",0.9631218644211563,0.24173027007106138,0.07606400968024876,0.6019845577861758,0.03255500369921748,0.017506072280759347,0.06936334421966596
Examining adaptations to water stress among farming households in Sri Lanka's dry zone,"Climate change is increasing water scarcity in Sri Lanka. Whether these changes will undermine national-level food security depends upon the ability of the small-scale farmers that dominate rice production and the institutions that support them to overcome the challenges presented by changing water availability. Analyzing household survey data, this research identifies household, institutional, and agroecological factors that influence how water-stressed farmers are working to adapt to changing conditions and how the strategies they employ impact rice yields. Paralleling studies conducted elsewhere, we identified institutional factors as particularly relevant in farmer adaptation decisions. Notably, our research identified farmers' use of hybrid seed varietals as the only local climate adaptation strategy to positively correlate with farmers' rice yields. These findings provide insight into additional factors pertinent to successful agricultural adaptation and offer encouraging evidence for policies that promote plant breeding and distribution in Sri Lanka as a means to buffer the food system to climate change-exacerbated drought.",0.9508139842866106,0.19305538662362806,0.12502239063216372,0.4603486378370663,0.03772833421678193,0.026300930956004092,0.11296141091058609
"Gender differences in farmers' responses to climate change adaptation in Yongqiao District, China","This study examines the gender differences in farmers' responses to climate change adaption in Yongqiao District, China. A random sampling technique was used to select 220 household heads, while descriptive statistics and binary logit models were used to analyze the data obtained from the households. We determine that male and female respondents are not significantly different in their knowledge and perceptions of climate change, but there is a gender difference in adopting climate change adaptation measures. Male-headed households are more likely to adopt new technology for water conservation and to increase investment in irrigation infrastructure. The research also indicates that the adaptation decisions of male and female heads are influenced by different sets of factors. The findings of this research help to elucidate the determinants of climate change adaptation decisions for male and female-headed households and the strategic interventions necessary for effective adaptation.

Limits to adaptation to interacting global change risks among smallholder rice farmers in Northwest Costa Rica,"In this paper, we discuss the theoretical relationships among interacting global change risks, valued livelihood goals, and adaptation limits. We build from research on the impacts of multiple and interacting global change risks in lesser-developed countries and seek to understand household adaptation limits in agrarian communities. We ask: What are valued livelihood goals among smallholder farmers in Northwest Costa Rica? How do socio-economic determinants of adaptive capacities determine their ability to meet these goals in the face of the impacts of interacting global change risks? Our data were based on focus groups, interviews, survey responses from 94 smallholder farmers, government statistics, and published literature. We analyzed our data using qualitative content analysis and quantitative logistic regression models. Our analysis showed that farmers perceived rice production as an identity, and that they were being forced to consider limits to their abilities to adapt to maintain that identity. We found that farm size, cattle ownership, years spent farming, and household income variety were determinants of their abilities to remain in rice production while maintaining sufficient levels of livelihood security. We also showed that for those households most vulnerable to water scarcity, their ability to successfully adapt to meet valued livelihood goals is diminished because adaptation to water scarcity increases vulnerability to decreased rice-market access. In this way, they become trapped by the inability to reduce their vulnerability to risks of the interaction between global changes and therefore abandon valued identities and livelihoods.

Farming through change: using photovoice to explore climate change on small family farms,"This research utilizes photovoice to examine how farmers on small family farms in central North Carolina are experiencing vulnerability to climate change. Understanding the adaptive behaviors of farmers is critical in fostering the resilience of these individuals, communities, and local food systems. A case study of seven farmers across six farms in Chatham County was conducted. Farming tenure ranged from oneyear to over 40years. Farm size ranged from less than one to 200 acres, and included certified and uncertified organic farms. Over a 5-month period, farmers were provided digital cameras to photograph issues or events on their farm related to a changing climate and focus group meetings were held to discuss the photographs and their significance. Findings indicate that developing effective social networks, implementing new adaptive behaviors such as polyculture, agrivoltism, seed saving programs, and flexible plantings may boost small farm resilience.",0.91793101384663,0.2890015325631193,0.09494339577613048,0.5071649461076556,0.03400090450332472,0.018487973921896533,0.05170300336824777
Measuring Adaptive Capacity of Farmers to Climate Change and Variability: Application of a Composite Index to an Agricultural Community in the Philippines,"Farming households in the Philippines are most vulnerable to climate change and variability due to their climate/weather-sensitive livelihood and lack of resources to finance adaptation measures. In order to formulate appropriate programs and policies addressing this vulnerability, it is essential to understand their adaptive capacity. This study analyzed the adaptive capacity to climate change and vulnerability of 520 farming households in Dumangas, a town in central Philippines confronting climate/weather-induced risks. The objectives were: to determine the levels of adaptive capacity of farming households to climate change, analyze the factors that cause the differences in adaptive capacity and find out whether adaptive capacity translates to adaptation. The level of adaptive capacity of each farming house hold was determined using a composite index based on previous studies. The index included five indicators namely human resources, physical resources, financial resources, information and diversity Results showed that variations in adaptive capacity were caused by differences in information resources, physical and financial resources. Farming households that scored low in these three indicators had lower adaptive capacity. It was also found out that despite their level of adaptive capacity, households employed measures to adapt to climate change and variability. Households with higher adaptive capacity however employed more adaptation strategies.",0.810948537763258,0.31183681550849196,0.11009761407713958,0.49358004418378826,0.061476782546524375,0.0466040881162042,0.1295495451063625

Factors influencing farmers’ awareness and choice of indigenous practices in adapting to climate change and variability in Northern Ghana,"Farmers in Northern Ghana adapt to the adverse effects of climate change using traditional practices. However, farmers’ awareness of these practices is a spring-board to their choices of available indigenous climate related adaptation strategies. This study examined farmers’ awareness and usage of indigenous adaptation strategies using the Heckman Two-Stage Sample Selection Model. Questionnaire was administered to 285 randomly selected households to determine the factors influencing farmers’ awareness and choice of indigenous adaptation strategies. The empirical results showed that majority of farmers are aware of and employed soil related indigenous adaptation strategies. Education, membership of farmer-based organisation, farmer-farmer extension contacts and farming experience significantly determine farmers’ awareness of indigenous adaptation strategies. Farmers’ level of education, farming experience, farmer-farmer extension contacts, membership of farmer group, labour hours and age significantly influenced farmers’ choice of indigenous climate related adaptation strategies. Based on these findings, it is recommended that farmers should endeavour to form groups to serve as a platform to share knowledge on indigenous farming practices for effective climate change adaptation. © 2018, Ecological Laboratory.

Small-holder farmers' climate change adaptation practices in the Upper East Region of Ghana,"The paper assessed the existing adaptation strategies implemented by farmers in the Upper East Region of Ghana to reduce the adverse impacts of climate change and variability. The paper used data collected through a series of participatory methods including focus group discussions, questionnaire surveys and key informant interviews in 4 farming communities with different socioeconomic backgrounds in the Bongo and Talensi-Nabdam Districts of the Upper East Region. Results showed that farmers' adaptation to climate change and variability may be categorized under agricultural, water management, communal pooling and livelihood diversification techniques. Specific livelihood diversification adaptation practices identified in the study communities include charcoal or fuel wood sales, temporal and permanent migration to urban areas in search of non-existing jobs. Communal pooling, involving joint ownership and sharing of wealth, labor or incomes across households, is not widely practiced and should be enhanced. The findings showed that male and female farmers may engage in different set of adaptation practices to cope with climate change. Further, the results showed that farmers, especially female farmers, were constrained by a lack of property rights of farmlands, lack of credit facilities and lack of access to irrigation facilities, inadequate climate change information and inadequate seeds for planting. The paper recommends that farmers should be encouraged to form farmer-based associations to network socially, access credit facilities, land, insurance products, extension services and training to empower communities and women. Fostering peer exchange of information between communities will ensure best practices, and lessons learnt are shared and scaled-up.

Impact of community-based organizations on climate change adaptation in agriculture: empirical evidence from Nepal,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of community-based organizations (CBOs) on the adoption of agricultural adaptations to climate change impacts. To this end, we first analyze farmers' perceptions on changes in local climatic condition, its impact and adaptations on agriculture based on information collected through a questionnaire survey of 720 farming households in six districts of Nepal. The findings reveal a widespread feeling of weather getting warmer, decreasing precipitation, and increasing weather unpredictability. It is found that climate change has adversely affected agriculture in Nepal, and farmers have adopted various adaptation practices to minimize the impacts. Second, we employ propensity score matching technique to examine the impact of CBOs on climate change adaptation. About 62% of the sampled farming households were associated with CBOs, and several socioeconomic factors influence such association. This study provides evidence supporting the argument that CBOs play important role in reducing the negative impacts of climate change by enhancing the adoption of adaptation strategies. It is also evident from the study the need of further strengthening and institutionalizing the informal farmers' groups and institutions for the successful adaptation.",0.9253705163968932,0.23338751796122192,0.08867117464097712,0.4947097672715646,0.030718520460940292,0.019800523324891624,0.029672068776450008
Assessing the roles of community forestry in climate change mitigation and adaptation: A case study from Nepal,"Integration of the mitigation and adaptation roles of forests is important in addressing climate change issues. Community forests (CFs) have capacity to contribute in both roles as local communities are collectively working to improve forests and to fulfil their own basic forest product needs. Nowadays, an incentive mechanism for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, conservation of forests, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of carbon stocks in forests (REDD+) is emerging and already has received considerable attention in achieving climate change mitigation whereas there has been little analysis of its potential contribution to adaptation objectives, particularly at the community level. Therefore the overarching goal of this study was to analyse CFs from a mitigation and adaptation perspective. This study assesses 105 CFs covering a range of forest types managed by socially diverse communities of Nepal. Two point carbon data (2010 and 2013) was analysed to investigate differences in carbon stocks in these forests following the introduction of a REDD+ pilot program in Nepal. Similarly, a document review and focused group discussions were organised to evaluate the livelihood support and adaptation potential of pilot REDD+ CFs. This study found that community forest user groups (CFUGs) have increased forest carbon stocks and that the pilot REDD+ projects are also delivering livelihood benefits which ultimately will help adaptation to adverse climatic conditions. However, the motivation for communities to realise REDD+ carbon incentives may reduce the food supplement capacity of forests by limiting vegetation diversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Crop diversification as a smallholder livelihood strategy within semi-arid agricultural systems near Mount Kenya,"Crop diversification is one strategy that smallholder farmers may employ to reduce their vulnerability in the face of global environmental change. Diversification not only expands the number of potential crop types for market, it also improves agroecosystem functioning by building redundancy into the agricultural system and allowing for innovation in areas exhibiting impacts of climate variability. While the driving forces behind and impacts of crop diversification have been extensively investigated, there are particular issues for the prospects of crop diversification to reduce household vulnerability within semiarid agricultural systems. The decision to diversify crops is a particularly challenging one for farmers in semi-arid systems. Semi-arid systems can exhibit greater variability in annual precipitation in areas that are marginal for agricultural production. Changes to the timing of the growing season (onset of rains) and mid-season dry periods in particular pose significant challenges to farmers in semi-arid ecosystems. This paper examines the spatial diversification of crop types across an upland-lowland gradient on Mount Kenya's northwestern slopes. We perform regression analyses using household-level survey data collected during the summer of 2012 to investigate the factors contributing to varying levels of crop diversification and implications for crop production in a semi-arid irrigated agricultural system. We hypothesize that the study area locations at higher elevations will be able to grow a greater variety of crops due to climate suitability. Our analysis demonstrates that household-level income, field size, exposure to agricultural extension officers, and suitability of environmental conditions are related to the likelihood of smallholder crop diversification. More favorable growing conditions appear to outweigh limitations posed by inaccessibility and financial constraints, which has implications for adaptation to climate change in semi-arid ecosystems. We discuss the results in the context of challenges posed by global environmental change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Farmers' perception, awareness and adaptation to climate change: evidence from northwest Vietnam","Purpose - This study aims to examine the extent to which farmers are aware of climate change and how they have modified their growing practices in response to perceived climate changes. Design/methodology/approach - A logit model was used to explore farmers' awareness and a binary logistic model was used to analyze their adaptive responses. Data from 335 farm households were collected from three provinces of Northwest Vietnam with different climate change vulnerability. Findings - Farmers' awareness of climate change was related significantly to household and farm characteristics. Farm experience, education level, location, tenancy status, soil fertility, access to credit, climate information, agricultural extension services, farmer groups, non-agriculture income, distance to market and house and climate change experience influence adaptationmeasure choices. Research limitations/implications - These findings suggest that investment strategies must promote adaptation to climate change by supporting technological and institutional methods, such as education, markets, credit and information. Originality/value - This study is the first study that uses econometric models to analyze farmers' perception effect and adaptation to climate change aspect in Northwest Vietnam",0.9503066760716046,0.21778639599407237,0.07638763164388451,0.49400879720738367,0.023124842292724154,0.022280042192286346,0.012853494999434112
Adaption to climate change: a case study of two agricultural systems from Kenya,"This study contributes to a better understanding of climate change adaptation by investigating different farming systems and by including cognitive factors as explanatory variables. We compared a food crop and a horticultural farming system, regarding applied adaptation measures and factors influencing adaptation. The data were based on a field survey of 267 smallholder farmers in Laikipia County of Kenya. A binary logistic regression was conducted against individual adaptation measures to identify determinants of adaptation. Adaptation measures employed by food crop farmers were mainly risk-reducing, such as mixed- and inter-cropping, planting early-maturing crop varieties and early planting. In contrast, horticultural farmers tended to focus more on intensifying crop production and applied crop rotation, irrigation and application of agro-chemicals, artificial fertilizer and manure. Factors positively influencing adaptation included access to extension services and risk perception among horticultural farmers, and access to workforce and farmers groups among food crop farmers. Furthermore, food crop farmers with access to less risk-prone income sources than agriculture seemed to have less motivation to adapt. The study showed that as climate change progresses, social differences between horticultural and food crop farmers are likely to increase, hence leading to inequalities in adaptation at local levels. Adaptation planners need to address these differences if sustainable adaptation is to be achieved.",0.9938521506107778,0.11363891494633632,0.05983591617703377,0.6009030329373731,0.010899193180874052,0.011306797997480132,0.008003454818395206
Drought Adaptation and Climate Change Beliefs among Working Ranchers in Montana,"Agricultural producers may be particularly vulnerable to climate impacts, such as drought. To better understand how ranchers respond to ongoing drought and the relationship between climate change beliefs and drought adaptation, in-depth interviews with working ranchers were conducted. Ranchers described drought conditions as unprecedented and detailed the interacting impacts of drought and nonclimatic stressors. They viewed adaptation as critical and employed a wide range of responses to drought, but lack of financial resources, risks associated with change, local social norms, and optimism about future moisture created barriers to change. Most ranchers attributed drought to natural cycles and were skeptical about anthropogenic climate change. Many ranchers likened current drought conditions to past droughts, concluding that conditions would return to normal. A belief in natural cycles provided a sense of hope for some ranchers but felt immutable to others, reducing their sense of agency and efficacy. Taken together, climate skepticism, optimism about future conditions, lack of financial resources, and a limited sense of agency might be reducing investments in long-term adaptation. However, the relationship between climate change beliefs and adaptation action was not entirely clear, since the handful of ranchers adapting in anticipation of long-term drought were skeptical or uncertain about anthropogenic climate change. Further, most ranchers characterized adaptation as an individual endeavor and resisted government involvement in drought adaptation. In the context of climate skepticism and antigovernment sentiment, strategies to scale up adaptation efforts beyond the household will only succeed to the extent that they build on local norms and ideologies.",0.7413050028021223,0.31592530206899033,0.0830661089285788,0.3129745994824574,0.03754638719484348,0.046548797700914774,0.149416960683778
What Defines Livelihood Vulnerability in Rural Semi-Arid Areas? Evidence from Pakistan,"Rural livelihoods in semi-arid Pakistan are increasingly exposed to climate impacts such as rising temperatures, erratic rainfalls and more intense and frequent climate-related extreme events. This is introducing new risks to the already vulnerable and marginalised societies that lack development and have high poverty rates. This study uses the IPCC Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) approach to analyse the determinants of household livelihood vulnerability defining vulnerability in terms of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. It also determines various adaptation responses that farmers apply and elucidates the reasons why some farmers choose not to adapt to climate change. It focuses on three semi-arid districts in Pakistan (Faisalabad, D.G. Khan and Mardan) and uses a sample of 150 rural agricultural households. As per the LVI scores, D.G. Khan is the most vulnerable district to climate change impacts, followed by Mardan and Faisalabad, respectively. Results show that (a lack of) adaptive capacity plays quite an important role in shaping households’ livelihood vulnerability for any given degree of exposure and sensitivity. Besides lower exposure and sensitivity to climate change, extremely low levels of adaptive capacity make Mardan more vulnerable to climate change compared to Faisalabad. The paper argues on people-centric development for rural areas through strengthening of agriculture sector as well as providing rural household opportunities for off-farm livelihoods. © 2018, The Author(s).",0.8708700500300313,0.2864466682024487,0.10619012005870278,0.5698996576967129,0.05891778312484716,0.025626747223114203,0.08298956873338617
"Implication of climate change and variability on stream flow in Iringa region, Tanzania","This paper investigates the implication of climate change and variability on the river flow within the traditional irrigation farming system, vinyungu, in Iringa region, Tanzania. The study aimed at establishing areas that are most impacted by climate change in terms of river flow and various adaptation strategies. It is based on both primary data collected by questionnaires distributed randomly among 189 farmers and key informant checklists conducted with villages' leaders and Agriculture Extension Officers. Two focused group discussions were carried out for each village as well as the researcher's own observations, and secondary data includes: literature review, rainfall and river flow data. The long-term annual trends of rainfall and river flow were analyzed via Mann-Kendall's statistical test and linear trend analysis. Climate data on rainfall trend showed a significant decreasing pattern during the last 17 years. Also, river flow data showed a slight decline within the same period. Decrement in river flow, combined with rainfall fluctuation, forced farmers to employ various adaptation strategies. Following the severity of the problem the paper recommends that more research be conducted on proper water management for sustainable river flow for both agriculture production and environmental management.",0.8710392178052461,0.210261728660763,0.0973653874711095,0.46521728239083904,0.05099914836611807,0.04602537717988215,0.1869351574878737
"Fish farmers’ perceptions, impacts and adaptation on/of/to climate change in Africa (the case of Egypt and Nigeria)","Perception is the bed rock to really apprehend the assertiveness and interpretations of the farmers which are the grass root receptors or benefactors of the effects of climate change.Individual perception and knowledge on climate change varies according to geographical location, occupation, political and socio-economics, ecological, cultural background of the entity.Empirical observations and climate models both indicate that global climate and ocean conditions have been changing over the last 100 years and will likely change more rapidly in the future.Fish production and supply in Africa could not meet up with the demand of the consumers as a result of financial constraints, low capital investment, high cost of fish stocking and feeding, dry season, pollution and climate change.This research therefore, assesses the fish farmers’ perceptions, impacts and adaptation on/of/to climate change in Africa, using Egypt and Nigeria as archetypal examples.It also annotates the precautionary measures taken by the fish farmers to ameliorate the negative impacts of climate change in the continent.KoboCollect method was used to design relevant questions and analyzed the fish farmers’ responses.The results revealed that climate change has both positive and negative impacts on African aquaculture and it is believe that aquaculture is a way of adapting to the adverse effect of climate change on fisheries.93% of the fish farmers in Africa have the ideal of climate change, 64% believe that the change will linger and persevere in the next 10–20 years.In Nigeria, 61% of the respondents relied on stream and river while in Egypt, 99% of the fish farmers cultured their fish on earthen ponds and depend on the use of agricultural drainage water.Fish production could not meet up with the demand of the consumers in Nigeria as a result of pending constraints unlike Egypt which has achieved the scale of aquaculture expansion compare to other African countries.It is therefore, expedient that efforts should be geared towards regional and continental integration in order to encourage aquaculture practices in other part of Africa and climate change investment should be encouraged. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",0.8774200968869794,0.21380853143720457,0.13180419864760362,0.4036011023007764,0.06784836199694966,0.02597302189076544,0.05201414912329971
A new framework to analyse workforce contribution to Australian cotton farm adaptability,"Farmers face many challenges, including climate variability, that require continual adaptation. However, studies of farm adaptation have paid limited attention to the farm workforce, despite changes in farm workforce organisation (i.e. the number, type and forms of employment on farm) being a significant feature of agricultural change globally. To effectively support farmers' adaptation, it is important to understand farmers' workforce strategies (i.e. how farm workforce organisation supports the needs and priorities of the farm), how workforce choices are made and the implications for adaptation. This paper progresses a framework for analysing farm adaptability, including the farm workforce. Bringing together theories of livelihoods analysis and strategic human resource management, the farm workforce strategies of 16 case study farms in the Australian cotton production sector are analysed. Cotton production is exposed to major resource constraints, such as irrigation water. We interviewed farmers and collected data on farm business performance, workforce organisation choices, human resource management practices and employees' experiences of work. We integrated data to characterise farm workforce decision-making and the relationship between workforce strategies and farm adaptability for each farm. A cross-case analysis explored differences between farms. A diversity of workforce strategies was found, involving combinations of workforce options, defined as 'core', 'contract' and 'casual' workers at different levels of skills and experience. Farm workforce strategies were found to influence and be influenced by sources of financial capital, irrigation water availability/holdings, farm remoteness, new farm infrastructure and human resource management practices. The farm workforce was a response option to provide production flexibility, yet high adaptability was associated with some negative consequences for managers and employees. We show for the first time the influence of farm workforce organisation dynamics in adaptation and negative consequences of high farm adaptability. 'Factoring-in' the farm workforce in sustainable development studies should therefore be a priority.",0.9545305808411201,0.22364339658298774,0.11739599347943376,0.4852115137529068,0.040309516298647534,0.019545183842065324,0.05499910711316265
HELPING FARMERS ADAPT TO CLIMATE AND CROPPING SYSTEM CHANGE THROUGH INCREASED ACCESS TO SORGHUM GENETIC RESOURCES ADAPTED TO PREVALENT SORGHUM CROPPING SYSTEMS IN BURKINA FASO,"Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is a major staple crop of Burkina Faso where farmers continue to cultivate photoperiod-sensitive guinea landraces as part of the strategy to minimize risk and ensure yield stability. In the Boucle du Mouhoun region, however, sorghum farmers appear to have insufficient varietal choice due to cropping systems having shifted towards more intensive cultivation of cotton and maize, and rainfall patterns having decreased over the past decade. In search for new varietal options that can respond to this changing context, researchers decided to give farmers access to ex-situ national collections along with the opportunity to evaluate recent improved varieties. From 2002 to 2007, researchers and farmers worked closely together to implement on-farm testing, including varietal selection trials, crop management and multi-locational trials. Farmers' choices tend to differ among groups, villages and years, with the exception of four particular landraces: two originating from a collection carried out in the Mouhoun region more than 30 years previous to this research, and two other landraces that came from the dissimilar agro-ecological zones of Burkina Faso. These four were the most commonly selected landraces out of 36 cultivars that covered both improved and landrace varieties. Farmers' selection criteria were focused on adaptation to agro-climatic conditions as well as specific grain qualities for processing and consumption. The potential usefulness of each variety was verified via multi-locational trials. The paper also shows that wide dissemination of experimental seed, not just across the Mouhoun region but also at a national scale, was largely achieved through collaboration with a strong farmer organisation in conjunction with farmer training programs focused on the on-farm seed production and the commercialisation of this seed.",0.9564126721383276,0.1721506420237141,0.10194375619838178,0.4942654254606839,0.033402401902995295,0.025650205483403632,0.04578640285870743
"Farmer perceptions of climate change risk and associated on-farm management strategies in Vermont, northeastern United States","Little research has been conducted on how agricultural producers in the northeastern United States conceptualize climate-related risk and how these farmers address risk through on-farm management strategies. Two years following Tropical Storm Irene, our team interviewed 15 farmers in order to investigate their perceptions of climate-related risk and how their decision-making was influenced by these perceptions. Our results show that Vermont farmers are concerned with both ecological and economic risk. Subthemes that emerged included geographic, topographic, and hydrological characteristics of farm sites; stability of land tenure; hydrological erosion; pest and disease pressure; market access; household financial stability; and floods. Farmers in our study believed that these risks are not new but that they are significantly intensified by climate change. Farmer responses were heavily focused on adaptation activities, with discussion of climate change mitigation activities notably absent. Psychological distance construal theory and hyperbolic dis-counting emerged as well-suited frames to explain why farmers reported adaptation activities but not mitigation strategies. Farmers will probably experience an increasing severity of climate-related impacts in the northeast region; therefore, information about climate-related risks coming from farmers' personal experience should be integrated with forecasting data to help farmers plan effective adaptation strategies.",0.9368109422421357,0.23379940793175213,0.12500130576765317,0.4252482094139754,0.033978868819440206,0.02388887523425136,0.05333660632765839
Climate change perceptions and response strategies of forest fringe communities in Indian Eastern Himalaya,"The study documented perception of forest fringe community of Chilapata reserve forest in West Bengal, India, from September 2013 to May 2015 through questionnaire-based personal in-depth interviews involving 400 respondents and group discussions. Adaptation strategies used by the community in response to impact of climate change were also documented. Majority of the respondents were farmers with marginal land holding. Almost all the respondents perceived the phenomena of climate change. The overall perception of the community toward change in temperature-related events and precipitation is high with average perception score of 0.74, while it is medium for change in regularity of climate events with score of 0.51. In spite of such perceptions, the community had low average livelihood impact perception score of 0.23. Considering the adaptation strategies based on knowledge-adoption index, the adaptation in response to climate change is at medium level with average mean score of 0.63. A total of 17 coping options were identified. Pre-monsoon dry seeding, agroforestry, crop rotation, short duration crop varieties and use of organic products were popular.

Connecting genebanks to farmers in East Africa through the distribution of vegetable seed kits,"Genebanks explore new partnerships with farmers and other user groups to provide smallholder farmers in Africa better access to crop diversity for improved nutrition, climate change adaptation and agricultural diversification. This paper shows how the World Vegetable Center (WorldVeg) genebank of traditional African vegetables and its partners distributed over 42,000 seed kits containing over 183,000 vegetable seed samples from 2013 to 2017 to smallholder farmers in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. The seed kits contained seed samples of promising accessions and open-pollinated breeding lines of traditional African vegetables, and to a lower degree of tomato, Capsicum pepper and soybean, usually enough to plant in a home garden. We identified four research questions to better understand the role of vegetable seed kits in strengthening local seed systems, impact on local vegetable diversity, improving human nutrition and supporting climate-resilient agriculture. As formal seed systems expand their reach, the genebank's role to supply vegetable diversity to public and private breeding programmes becomes more important.

Crop productivity and adaptation to climate change in Pakistan,"The effectiveness of adaptation strategies is crucial for reducing the costs of climate change. Using plot-level data from a specifically designed survey conducted in Pakistan, we investigate the productive benefits for farmers who adapt to climate change. The impact of implementing on-farm adaptation strategies is estimated separately for two staple crops: wheat and rice. We employ propensity score matching and endogenous switching regressions to account for the possibility that farmers self-select into adaptation. Estimated productivity gains are positive and significant for rice farmers who adapted, but negligible for wheat. Counterfactual gains for non-adapters were significantly positive, which is potentially a sign of transactions costs to adaptation. Other factors associated with adaptation were formal credit and extension, underscoring the importance of addressing institutional and informational constraints that inhibit farmers from improving their farming practices. The findings provide evidence for the Pakistani Planning and Development Department's ongoing assessment of climate-related agricultural losses.",0.90621847499505,0.19108263909749587,0.07503936899087224,0.46670327959060465,0.036694338411784225,0.035254651970307485,0.0460128428319977
Disease risk perception and diversity of management strategies by farmers: The case of anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides on water yams (Dioscorea alata) in Guadeloupe,"Disease perception and adequate management practices are two essential issues faced by farmers, especially in the current context of climate change which may potentially increase disease risk. We investigated the diversity of water yam cropping systems in Guadeloupe through interviews, how producers and international yam research scientists perceived anthracnose, and how this perception correlated with farmers' risk management strategies. We found that disease perception by farmers is very close to perception by international yam experts, as both have the same perception of the hierarchy of factors translating into disease. Three different yam production strategies coexist at a local scale, where agronomic practices and socio-economic profiles are distinct and consistent with attitude toward anthracnose risk management. Six factors were perceived as decreasing the disease: associated crop species; crop rotation; staking; weeding; crop monitoring and varietal admixture. Yam producers raising crops more intensively were risk prone, while others usually sought practices to manage disease appearance and spread. Both cumulative risk and past anthracnose epidemic experiences translated into heavier reliance on chemicals. These results have practical implications for designing best yam crop management systems and control of yam anthracnose. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecosystem governance in a highland village in Peru: Facing the challenges of globalization and climate change,"The agricultural systems of the Peruvian Andes have been created and maintained over many generations using locally adapted management practices that help to maintain agrobiodiversity while providing for local populations. Despite their longstanding history, many of these ecosystems and the services they provide are currently threatened by a number of economic and environmental factors. We use findings from behavioral science to examine the opportunities and conflicts at different governance levels individual, community, and global. Market pressures to produce for distant markets have resulted in reduced diversity of crops in the Andes region. Another major threat to ecosystem services in the region is climate change, which is already being observed in the form of rising temperatures, extreme temperature fluctuation, changing rainfall patterns, and increasing glacial melt. To explore the effects of, and the responses to, these pressures we used semi-structured interviews to gain insight into agricultural practices and challenges and the various levels of governance present in the agriculture of Langui, Peru. We find that low staple crop prices combined with increasing climate variability has led to a reduced production of traditional crops such as pseudocereals and tubers in favor of production of improved grasses for livestock. The growth of the livestock economy is being driven by the presence of a transnational dairy corporation in the region, plus increased migration leading to a reduced local labor force. We conclude that loss of traditional crops and community based agricultural management techniques will make it difficult for smallholders to maintain food self-sufficiency and agrobiocliversity in the face of a changing climate and global economy.

Economic costs of managing climatic risks in agriculture: Evidences from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan,"Exposure of agriculture to natural environment makes this sector more vulnerable to climate changes and climate induced risks including rising temperature, changes in rainfall patterns, floods, droughts and heavy rains etc. Farmers adopt available risk coping tools to minimize the impacts of such risks at farm level however, these adoptions require farmers to incur cost or forgo part of the potential benefits from agricultural production. These costs (explicit or implicit) are referred to as the cost of risk management. Previous studies on risk management in agriculture however have ignored such costs. The present study is therefore designed to investigate how adoption of risk coping tools affect farm productivity in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. 330 wheat growers were selected using multistage sampling technique and Analysis of Variance was used to compare the average wheat yield of farmers using different combinations of the two risk coping tools namely, off-farm diversification and precautionary savings. The results suggested that adoption of risk coping tools, particularly the simultaneous adoption of multiple tools at the same time, significantly reduced wheat yield. The research suggested that future studies should identify ways to minimize such costs associated with risk management at farm level. © 2019 ResearchersLinks.",0.8881291543550798,0.19305267229405385,0.09188540492843873,0.38555674961363007,0.011995472044389121,0.055758411587173304,0.05398970524453384

"Indigenous understanding of climate change, impacts and coping strategies in a rural setting of Kwara State, Nigeria","The issue of climate change is so critical to the extent that it affects about seventy five percent of Nigerians’ livelihoods. Climate related events such as floods, rainstorms, increasing temperature and droughts among others have been on the increase in the last few years. These have been attributed to both natural and human causes. This study examines the determinants of local people’s understanding of climate change, impacts and coping strategies in some selected rural communities of Kwara State, Nigeria with a view to comparing their knowledge with scientific knowledge. Eight rural communities were randomly selected from the State within the area representing more than 80% of the total local district areas. Since rural dwellers engage more in primary activities than any other activities, therefore, respondents were selected from farming, hunting and fishing activities. Participatory Rural Appraisal method with emphasis on group discussion technique and observatory technique were employed to collect data from the participants. Climatic data for two climatic normals were collected from the period 1957 to 1986 and 1987to 2016. Descriptive and inferential tools were used to achieve the stated objectives. The results revealed that local people have their own knowledge of the understanding of the climate change and findings revealed further that the farmers and other primary producers in the studied communities were indeed experiencing climate change variability and impacts. Result of the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics showed that the average age of respondents was 41.2 years, 80.64% were married, majority, (61.27%) had farming has their main occupation and mean years of experience of respondents was 24.5 years on farm and in the management of environmental resources. The multiple regression result revealed that gender, primary activities, age, local knowledge, coping strategies were found to increase the understanding of climate change of respondents. Focus Group Discussion showed that the respondents were very much aware of the climate change and there exist early warning mechanisms which they put in place against the future weather events. They have different local coping techniques to mitigate the possible impact. It was therefore recommended that more awareness be created to ensure that people realize the consequences of climate change and integrate the local knowledge with the formal strategies. © 2018, Lomonosov Moscow State University.

Adapting and coping with climate change in temperate forests,"A growing body of research documents how individuals respond to local impacts of global climate change and a range of policy efforts aim to help individuals reduce their exposure and improve their livelihoods despite these stressors. Yet there is still limited understanding of how to determine whether and how adaptation is occurring. Through qualitative analysis of focus group interviews, I evaluated individual behavioral responses to local forest stressors that can arguably be linked to global climate change among landowners in the Upper Midwest, USA. I found that landowner responses were planned as well as autonomous, more proactive than reactive, incremental rather than transformational, and aimed at being resilient to change and transitioning to new conditions, rather than resisting change alone. Many of the landowners' responses can be considered forms of adaptation, rather than coping, because they were aimed at moderating and avoiding harm on long time horizons in anticipation of change. These findings stand in contrast to the short-term, reactive, and incremental responses that current socio-psychological theories of adaptation suggest are more typical at the individual level. This study contributes to scientific understanding of how to evaluate behavioral adaptation to climate change and differentiate it from coping, which is necessary for developing conceptually rigorous analytical frameworks to guide research and policy.",0.394390307085396,0.37152220183817725,0.11062479423080361,0.3452837321072221,0.06864379318264692,0.10671164605127959,0.10093523402155413
The Effects of Climate Smart Agriculture and Climate Change Adaptation on the Technical Efficiency of Rice FarmingAn Empirical Study in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam,"This study employed the propensity score matching approach to empirically assess the effects of climate smart agriculture participation and climate change adaptation response on the technical efficiency of rice production. Observational data were collected from in-depth interviews with 352 rice farm households in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The findings indicate that 71% of local farmers adapted their rice farming to climate change related to salinity intrusion and drought, while 29% of farmers did not. Additionally, only twenty-two rice farmers were typically chosen as participants in the climate smart agriculture pilot program by local government and institutions. The choices for adaptation response and climate smart agriculture participation are significantly influenced by agricultural extension services, belief in climate change, the area of farming land, as well as geographical locations (e.g., province and access to water sources). The results also reveal that climate change adaptation response, including climate smart agriculture participation, played a crucial role in improving technical efficiency of rice production by 13%-14% compared to no adaptation response. Regarding the individual effect of climate smart agriculture participation, participants could achieve higher technical efficiency by 5%-8% compared to non-participants.",0.9646780217730503,0.15109616694465267,0.06874882409925226,0.4894742901856844,0.053026050852466526,0.012411980481760506,0.029293047626464033
Farmers' perceptions and management of risk in rice-based farming systems of south-west coastal Bangladesh,"Farmers in coastal Bangladesh face significant production and market risks as well as uncertainty about trends in the farming environment. Understanding farmers' perceptions of the risks they currently experience and the fanning and livelihood strategies they adopt to mitigate risk is important to inform policies designed to safeguard coastal livelihoods in the future. In this paper, we draw on a case study of typical village in the coastal zone to explore (1) farmers' perceptions of the cropping risks they face, (2) the implications of risk for the choice of cropping strategies within different farm types, and (3) the role of other farm and non-farm activities in mitigating risk to household livelihoods. Quantitative and qualitative farm-level data were collected through a reconnaissance survey, a village census, a household survey, and household case studies. Farmers saw the shortage of irrigation water in the dry season and uncertain weather patterns as the major sources of production risk. The main source of market risk was the fluctuation in farm-gate demand and prices for dry-season cash crops. Representative budgets were constructed for the major cropping systems practised by small, medium, and large farm households. The riskiness of these systems was simulated, based on farmers' estimates of yield and price variability, and a stochastic efficiency analysis was undertaken. The current systems appeared economically viable given the typical range of yields and prices. While some were riskier than others, farm households were largely able to balance their livelihood portfolios to offset the risks. Major risk management strategies included adoption of stress-tolerant rice varieties, staggering the sale of rice, using early wet season rice as a buffer, switching from rice to non-rice crops in the dry season, and undertaking off- or non-farm employment within and outside the village. The dominant trend was to farm and livelihood diversification, contributing to household resilience. However, at the village level, public policy to safeguard the agricultural environment will be crucial to sustaining household risk management strategies.",0.9839514677280202,0.1729302127224731,0.059977151780250086,0.5121550060684072,0.03296818740588459,0.013589766793734796,0.026772017888701868
Climate change perceptions and adaptive responses of small-scale coffee farmers in Costa Rica,"Introduction. Climate change will affect the distribution, productivity and profitability of coffee production in Central America, negatively impacting national economies and small farmer livelihoods. There is a need to understand how climate change affects small coffee farmers in the region in order to promote measures that allow them to cope with and adapt to these changes. Objective. The objective of this study was to describe Costa Rican small-scale coffee systems in two vulnerable agricultural landscapesand explorethe adaptation efforts that coffee farmers have implemented in these two coffee systems. Materials and methods. Structured surveys were conducted with coffeeproducing households in two highly vulnerable landscapes, Turrialba and Los Santos, in Costa Rica, from March-May 2014. The study was based on farmers' perceptions of changes in temperature and rain, reported impacts of these changes and the adaptation actions implemented at farm level. Results. Ninety-eight percentof farmers perceived changes in local climate and most of them related these changes with impacts on production (increase in pests and diseases, floweringproblems and other reported impacts). Sixty percentof the surveyed farmers had modified the management of their farms in order to reduce climate change impacts. The most common adaptation measures used by farmers were the planting of trees and the increased use of agrochemical inputs, mostly in response to perceptions of increasing temperatures. Conclusion. This study highlights the nerd for greater technical, financial and policy support to help smallholder coffee farmers implement adaptation practices and become more resilient to climate change.",0.9875702058058093,0.147409165829775,0.07618679342478904,0.5174907101692992,0.01728911863860846,0.009807988978324387,0.015239762875252265
Induce or reduce? The crowding-in effects of farmers' perceptions of climate risk on chemical use in China,"Farmers' perceptions of climate risk reflect their subjective probability weighting bias, which are the prerequisite for their adaptation decisions and thus shape their actions. As an adaptation strategy, farmers prioritized the technological measures of chemical input as the most simple and convenient for climate risks. However, this is little evidence of empirical work on the mechanism between farmers' perceptions and chemical use behavior. Based on 1080 households' survey data from 4 leading rice provinces in China, this study develops a theoretical framework that considers adaptation decisions of heterogonous farmers within a perception-decision-action (PDA) analytical framework, and further estimates the effects of farmers' perceptions on chemical use behavior by utilizing endogenous switching regression model. The results indicate that under ceteris paribus, the key variables ""perception of climate risk"" of farmers have significant effect on their claim of increase in the quantity of chemical use. Farmers who perceived very obvious climate risk increased by about 13% in the quantity of chemical use, while farmers who perceived obvious climate risk increased by 8%. We find evidence of crowding-in of farmers' perceptions on chemical use. The paper concludes by offering some policy implications for the presented results.",0.9453866037414924,0.2008245034186007,0.04894493887585098,0.41035329580028884,0.03714334886098459,0.025986400300106613,0.04006103394883514
"Adaptation to Climate Change among Farmers in Bulacan, Philippines","The vulnerability of the Philippines to climate change and variability has been highlighted by its exposure to severe weather-related conditions. Farmers are particularly vulnerable to such adverse effects given their limited adaptive capacity. In this regard, this study examines the local adaptation experiences and practices of farmers in a second-class farming municipality. It is then based on the assumption that a lay understanding of how farmers perceive and adapt to climate change can be used to provide implications for enhancing their adaptive capacity. Using a combination of qualitative data from key informant interviews and focus group discussion and secondary data from government agencies, this paper reveals that farmers perceive serious health and livelihood risks despite having limited knowledge of how climate change occurs. They recognize that changes in climate conditions have caused considerable effects to temperature and rainfall which, in turn, have posed serious challenge to water supply. Their farming activities are also at risk from interrelated impacts such as damage to crops, pest infestation, and decrease in rice yield. Hence, they consistently employ common adaptation measures as direct responses to climate variability such as the planting of new crop varieties, use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, use of technology in farming, and diversification of household income. However, the lack of financial resources hinders them from utilizing new adaptation techniques and technologies, which they perceive to be more appropriate and beneficial. These results suggest a more conscious effort of transforming coping strategies to short-term climate variability into adaptation measures to long-term climate changes.",0.9511274234870393,0.22122585558573113,0.07736405886901601,0.5218147819671453,0.017162250480073582,0.019861943844397566,0.11286163169930064
Exploring Farmers' Climate Change Perceptions and Adaptation Intentions: Empirical Evidence from Austria,"The lack of timely adaptation in agriculture may hamper prosperous farm developments by neglecting risks and opportunities emerging from climate change. Understanding farmers' perceptual and socio-cognitive processes is key in order to encourage on-farm adaptation. We aim at investigating how farmers' individual cognition on climate change and adaptation as well as socio-environmental context factors affect agricultural adaptation intention and avoidance. We build on the Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPACC) and apply a qualitative interview approach in two Austrian farming regions. Twenty semi-structured interviews have been conducted with 29 farmers. Based on the results of the qualitative content analysis, we have identified four groups of farmers, which differ in the formation process of adaptation intention and avoidance: (i) climate change adaptors, (ii) integrative adaptors, (iii) cost-benefit calculators, and (iv) climate change fatalists. Farmers who are part of groups (i)-(iii) form adaptation intentions, whereas climate change fatalists do not intend to adapt. According to our analysis, adaptation intentions are only formed if farmers are aware of effective adaptation measures, accept personal responsibility for their farms, and evaluate adaptation costs positively (i.e. adaptation appraisal). Farmers' climate change appraisal as well as farm and regional characteristics are also perceived relevant for farmers' adaptation decisions but seem to be less important than adaptation appraisal. Therefore, we conclude that engagement strategies and outreach efforts need not only address risks and opportunities, but should also strengthen farmers' self-responsibility and offer adaptation measures tailored to the regional characteristics and the farmers' needs.",0.9339838977799765,0.18995137340070767,0.1352984611734221,0.3547399592333428,0.041556623278672114,0.030278059033476155,0.026721604224913955
Crop switching as an adaptation strategy to climate change: the case of Semien Shewa Zone of Ethiopia,"Purpose - The geographical range of agricultural crops is shifting because of climate change. Reducing the potential negative impact of this shift requires efficient crop switching at farm level. Yet there are scant studies that examine how crop switching is currently taking place and what factors facilitate the process. Even these few existing studies often based their analysis on inadequately established causal link between climate change and switching decisions. This study aims to identify the specific switching decisions that are primarily motivated by climate change, and their determinants. Design/methodology/approach - The study used a household survey on 190 households in Semien Shewa Zone in Ethiopia. Subjective rating of farmers was used to identify the relative importance of climate change in motivating the different types of switching decisions. A logit model is used to identify determinants of crop switching decisions primarily motivated by climate change. Findings - Farmers in the study area are currently abandoning certain crops as a response to climate change. The adoption of new crops is, however, mainly attributed to price changes. Most farmers who abandoned at least one crop adopted mung bean mainly due to its price advantages. As expected, crop switching as an adaptation strategy is more prevalent particularly in drier and hotter agroecologies. The logit model showed that crop switching is strongly correlated with land size and agroecology. Originality/value - This paper provides an in-depth examination of crop switching as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Crop switching is an adaptation strategy that is expected to substantially reduce the damage from climate change in agriculture. The findings are particularly relevant for adaptation planning in the context of smallholder agriculture.",0.9269763191356942,0.1799401587675176,0.09654251533217727,0.4350596890473377,0.043677417156698664,0.029615784552475453,0.012107967116437537
Farmers' knowledge and perception of climatic risks and options for climate change adaptation: a case study from two Tanzanian villages,"An in-depth understanding of the multiple layers of factors that shape farmers' knowledge and perception of climatic risks and their adaptive responses is a prerequisite for well-targeted agricultural adaptation planning. However, while farmers' perception is increasingly understood as being a key determinant, a conceptual framework that includes this focus of analyses is currently not available. Against this background, this study analyzes the agricultural adaptation context in two Tanzanian villages building on a newly developed agricultural adaptation and perception model (AAP). The AAP contains five dimensions as a frame of reference for empirical adaptation models: non-climatic determinants of vulnerability (1), general trends in livelihood strategies (2), perception of climatic trends (3), climate impacts in agriculture (4) and potentials and obstacles for adaptation (5). Empirical data were collected by applying various tools of rapid rural appraisal, a stakeholder workshop and supplementary interviews. The qualitative data were coded along the dimensions of the AAP and analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis. The results show that adaptation levels, sensitivities of the farming systems as well as perception and narratives about climatic and yield dynamics differ considerably among the two farming communities. Furthermore, farmers' adaptation responses are influenced by both their framing of climatic trends as well as the multiple benefits that the local agricultural systems provide. Thus, for improving food security in the face of climate change, farmers' perceptions and the multi-functionality of agricultural systems need to be explicitly recognized by agronomic adaptation research, and adaptation policy making should involve detailed vulnerability assessments.",0.9322024114593821,0.24870885814651142,0.09692492931647725,0.5,0.039423603183409185,0.025069235767077074,0.04636926530587436
Pastoralism and ecosystem-based adaptation in Kenyan Masailand,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the potential for pastoral communities inhabiting Kenyan Masailand to adapt to climate change using conservancies and payments for ecosystem services. Design/methodology/approach - Multiple methods and data sources were used, comprising: a socio-economic survey of 295 households; informal interviews with pastoralists, conservancy managers, and tourism investors; focus group discussions; a stakeholder workshop. Monthly rainfall data was used to analyse drought frequency and intensity. A framework of the interactions between pastoralists' drought coping and risk mitigation strategies and the conservancy effects was developed, and used to qualitatively assess some interactions across the three study sites. Changes in household livestock holdings and sources of cash income are calculated in relation to the 2008-09 drought. Findings - The frequency and intensity of droughts are increasing but are localised across the three study sites. The proportion of households with per capita livestock holdings below the 4.5 TLU poverty vulnerability threshold increased by 34 per cent in Kitengela and 5 per cent in the Mara site, mainly due to the drought in 2008-2009. Payment for ecosystem services was found to buffer households from fluctuating livestock income, but also generates synergies and/or trade-offs depending on land use restrictions. Originality/value - The contribution of conservancies to drought coping and risk mitigation strategies of pastoralists is analyzed as a basis for evaluating the potential for ecosystem-based adaptation.",0.7837881822859588,0.2471328708201171,0.10020957799930798,0.5787817241481197,0.030622462848151392,0.04693886986551589,0.05874429713719139
Cotton production under risk: a simultaneous adoption of risk coping tools,"Agricultural production explicitly involves dealing with multiple risks, often simultaneously, and applying risk management strategies contemporaneously. However, farmers' behavior of concurrent adoption of multiple risk management tools was ignored in previous studies and formed the rationale for this research. This study was designed to assess the effect of socioeconomic factors, farmers' risk perceptions, the production management technologies, and access to information and credit on the adoption of price, climate, biological, and financial risk management strategies. The potential for simultaneous adoption of these strategies was also hypothesized and evaluated. Allowing for prospective correlation between the risk management strategies, a multivariate probit model was used on 302 randomly selected cotton farmers from Punjab province of Pakistan using multistage random sampling. The research findings established the simultaneous adoption of the four risk management strategies and that the adoption of one strategy encourages the farmer to adopt other strategy(ies). Significant factors in the adoption of various risk management strategies were found to be education, farming experience, land ownership, farmers' risk perceptions, the production management technologies, information access and credit access. The improvements in information access through quality extension services from the government and provision of alternative risk management options, including Crop Loan Insurance Scheme, are crucial to assist farmers in managing risks at farm level.",0.9615257729653168,0.16323473137495464,0.08172118922158281,0.4919748654976538,0.012206294082588066,0.023133475817931473,0.03123757138615979
Factors influencing adaptation strategies by livestock owners to combat climate variability in Karnataka state: Application of ordered logistic regression model,"Climate variability refers to the way climate fluctuates yearly above or below a long-term average value. It is considered as one of the most serious long-term challenges faced by livestock rearers, in this context it is important to know about the adaptation strategies followed by the livestock rearers in combating the climate variability vagaries. The present study was conducted in purposively selected northern dry zone of Karnataka with 120 livestock rearers, the major findings of the study were: Majority of the respondents were following adaptation strategies like keeping, promoting and interested in local breeds (60.83%), about 42.50% of livestock rearers made changes in micro-climate in cattle shed/stall, and 47.50% of respondents were providing extra concentrate, minerals supplementation and feed additives to their livestock, etc. An ordered logit model is estimated to investigate the factors influencing adoption of various strategies to combat climate variability. Among the adaptation strategies, the proportional odds assumption was satisfied only for keeping, promoting and interest in local breeds; change in micro-climate in cattle shed/stall and shifting from large ruminants to small ruminants were found significant with the herd size; land holding and education level of the respondents and for other variables the ordinal regression was not performed. It was also found that livestock rearers followed the cost effective adaption strategies, and all the adaptation techniques were region-specific, requiring no external help and were inherently scientific.",0.9212770651479583,0.24043669013661942,0.09565021665179195,0.5428571094691742,0.04281008355429921,0.024694238670436575,0.04964840670285367
An assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation in South Asian agriculture,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to synthesize the impacts of climate change on agriculture and assess the status of policies, programs and strategies to adapt small farmholders to climate change in South Asia. Design/methodology/approach - The authors collected secondary information through a desktop review of policy documents, action plans and published reports. Face-to-face interviews with policy makers, agriculture and climate experts representing the government, non-governmental organizations, international development agencies and the private sector were also conducted to validate the secondary information. Findings - The results revealed that agriculture is the dominant economic mainstay providing livelihood to over 70 per cent, employing 60 per cent of the labor force and contributing about 22 per cent of the regional gross domestic product. Climate impacts, such as floods, sea level rise and salt intrusion, increased frequency and intensity of storms, and pests combined with increasing water scarcity continue to reduce arable land, reduce yield of crops and threaten the food security of farmers. Adaptation efforts include using improved varieties of crop; changing cropping patterns and planting seasons; and water conservation techniques. However, progress remains low because of a lack of adequate technical knowledge and financial resources. Originality/value - The amount of published literature on climate change and its impact on agriculture is increasing, but there is little effort to analyze and document impacts and strategies to adapt small farm holders to climate change at a landscape level, particularly in South Asia. This study fills in this gap and will serve as a valuable source of information for those wishing to conduct research or develop adaptation strategies for any of the four countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal.",0.8280011797895698,0.2280971868620048,0.11032981686443266,0.4546591103285534,0.049516751932071786,0.06006905071444275,0.09717831366919796
Food acquisition programs in the Brazilian semi-arid region: benefits to farmers and impacts of climate change,"Climate change has been predicted to impact many vulnerable communities in rural regions of developing countries. Meanwhile, social protection programs have been discussed as strategies not only to address the current socioeconomic issues, but also to deal with vulnerabilities related to the capacity of people to cope with climate change. However, limited information remains available on the impacts of those social protection programs to beneficiaries, precluding further insights over the totality of effects due to program participation. In addition, the role of current environmental shocks and climate change over program functioning is far from being understood. Herein we investigate the perceived impacts, according to institutional actors, of a Brazilian food-based safety net program (Food Acquisition Program - PAA) on participating farmers, and the impacts of an extended drought on program functioning. Projections of changes in climate according to global and regionalized models provided in the literature were also used to discuss possible impacts on crops procured by the PAA. Overall, based on the interviews, PAA was perceived as positive with a diversity of effects at farm, household and community levels, while the extreme drought in 2012 impacted the program through the decreased availability of produce and even disruption of services. Changes in climate in the Northeast region will impact key crops procured by the program with possible consequences over all groups of beneficiaries if business stays as usual, requiring ex-ante adaptation over the various levels of program functioning.",0.674822150608856,0.3349093158834738,0.1137829379601802,0.4539511532387384,0.06427881520739706,0.0652841462429729,0.11893135514468635

Towards a Sociology of Adaptation to Rainfall Variability in Rural Zimbabwe: The Case of Charewa in Mutoko,"Rainfall variability has introduced new challenges for farmers in rural Zimbabwe, who are already facing various difficulties in maintaining their insecure livelihoods. Yet, current adaptation theories and inquiries have failed to sufficiently account for and analyse how these farmers are responding to changing climatic conditions. In this respect, a number of studies have been heavily embedded in deterministic concepts and fail to take into account the structures, processes and conditions underpinning adaptation processes. As such, based on an empirical case study and using qualitative data collection methods such as life history interviews, this paper argues that the process of adaptation is ostensibly not straightforward but complex. As it evolves, farmers find themselves facing numerous constraining structures and processes. What is critical is that they are able to circumvent the constraints presented to them and at the same time activate the corresponding enablements. Sociologically then, adaptation is an evolving, complex and reflexive process.",0.6812546130843821,0.3336598078592641,0.10470380713762137,0.4275171975018724,0.0621398158880612,0.051344544999947984,0.11935952657640474
Comparison of measured multi-decadal rainfall variability with farmers' perceptions of and responses to seasonal changes in western Uganda,"Smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are not only dealing with decreased production from land degradation, but are also impacted heavily by climate variability. Farmers perceive decreased rainfall or shortened rainy seasons throughout SSA; however, the link between perceptions and climate variability is complex, especially in areas with increasing land degradation. Moreover, little is known about climate variability and farmers' perceptions in central equatorial Africa. The purpose of this study is to quantify interannual rainfall variability from 1983 to 2014 in western Uganda and to relate the rainfall variability and associated changes in soil moisture to perceptions and coping strategies of local farmers. Surveys of 308 farming households and 14 group interviews were conducted near Kibale National Park, and daily satellite-based rainfall data for the region were extracted from the African Rainfall Climatology version 2 database. Results indicate a decrease in the long rains by approximately 3 weeks throughout much of the region; thus, soil-water deficits have intensified. Farmers perceived later onsets of both the short rains and long rains, while also reporting decreasing soil fertility and crop yields. Therefore, farmers' perceptions of rainfall variability in the Kibale region may reflect more the decrease in soil fertility than the shortened rainy seasons and decreased soil moisture. Expanding croplands has been the farmers' most prevalent coping strategy to decreased yields; however, nearly all the unfarmed land in western Uganda is now in protected areas. Consequently, western Uganda is facing a crisis at the nexus of population growth, land use change, and climate change.",0.982947679145063,0.14940490349929458,0.0833142100683838,0.6410891296283369,0.017586782271928957,0.010467919741571782,0.06010002673787267
"Climate Change Impact and Adaptation Practices in Agriculture: A Case Study of Rautahat District, Nepal","This study identifies the impact of climate change and adaptation practices on agriculture in the Rautahat district of central Nepal by analyzing the atmospheric temperature, rainfall pattern, soil moisture, and direct field survey. The impact and status of crop production systems are emphasized. Primary data on crop production system were collected through household surveys and adaptation practices in crop production were collected through focus group discussions, key informants' interviews, and direct observations. Time series data on key climatic variables and productivity of major crops were collected from the government sources. Mann-Kendall trend analysis and Sen's Slope methods were used for the analysis and quantification of temperature and rainfall trends. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was performed to find the relation of seasonal rainfall with the crop yields. The study showed that the annual average rainfall was decreasing at the rate of 10.21 mm/year and the annual mean temperature had increased at a rate of 0.02 degrees C/year over the last 30 years, but their variations were found to be statistically insignificant. Seasonal rainfall also increased, except for the post-monsoon rain. Estimation of Soil Moisture Index through remote sensing technique indicates that it has been reduced considerably over the past 15 years at the beginning of the monsoon. It was observed that farmers have been using different adaptation measures like the use of high-yielding varieties of crops, enhanced irrigation system, switching to hybrid seed, and increased access to pesticides. As a result, the yields of major crops including rice, maize, wheat, sugarcane, potatoes, and pulses all showed increasing trends during 1999 to 2014. However, the total costs of production of all crops have increased many fold as a consequence of the cost associated with the arrangements for such adaptation measures and shifts towards market-based commodities.",0.9804486474408665,0.1600536228037294,0.07787839530895031,0.5245098209696085,0.01315068837750122,0.016697041606975584,0.02548765031621896
Determinants and Policy Implications of Farmers' Climate Adaptation Choices in Rural Cameroon,"The issue of climate change and its related impacts is now a social reality. The paradigm shift today in climate change issues is focused on mitigation and adaptation. Besides mitigation, adaptation is considered as an essential strategy for reducing the severity and cost of climate change impacts given the fact that additional future climate change is considered as being inevitable. In this paper, we analyze household socio-economic determinants of climate change adaptation and their policy implications. A survey of 130 farmers in four farm communities in Cameroon was conducted to capture the determinants of farmers' adaptation to climate change. We employed the binary Logistic regression model to assess the determinants of climate adaptation. Results reveal that in the midst of climate change, 78.33% of farmers have adopted rainfall-related adaptation while 63.33% have resorted to temperature-related adaptation. Based on the binary logistic regression, access to road, access to non-farm income source, and membership of farmers' groups were significant determinants for the adoption of temperature-related adaptation options. Furthermore, access to improved seeds was found to be the lone significant determinant for the adoption of rainfall-related adaptation options. All in all, much is required to strengthen farmers' adaptive capacity and increase the range of adaptation options undertaken. As such, policies geared towards building farmers' resilience should effectively capture the following tri-factors: provision of access roads linking farm communities to nearby urban centres, upscaling institutional interventions with regards to providing high quality and resistant seeds to farmers, and incentivizing farmers to create or join social groups in order to facilitate adaptation uptake.",0.9286749091781301,0.23203498147043802,0.058011985091890296,0.5135669176514805,0.026205198155853336,0.026621772323639045,0.03914158238838569
Assessing Maize Farmers' Adaptation Strategies to Climate Change and Variability in Ghana,"This study examined the adaptation strategies of maize farmers to climate change and variability in the Eastern Region of Ghana using primary data collected from 150 maize farming households by the administration of structured questionnaires. The results of the multinomial logit regression revealed that rainfall perception, access to credit, and farming experience significantly influenced the adoption of recommended agricultural practices, whereas the adoption of soil-related strategies is influenced by gender and rainfall perception. Farming experience and rainfall perception influenced the adoption of improved varieties strategies. This study highlights the need for the development of water resources for maize production in the context of the changing climate. In this respect, the crucial roles of the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority, the agricultural extension division of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, and other international organizations such as the Japan International Cooperation Agency and the World Bank regarding the development of irrigation facilities and the associated capacity building of the farmers are very important. Finally, the formation of Water User Associations for the smallholder farmers regarding the usage and maintenance of the irrigation facilities would be a step in the right direction.",0.9848501048770488,0.12083259111944677,0.0797461866171832,0.6217919391204337,0.009496899213738193,0.009165079695578608,0.08048228988591118

"Women's perspectives of small-scale fisheries and environmental change in Chilika lagoon, India","This article investigates the gendered implications of environmental change using case studies of two small-scale fishing communities in Chilika lagoon, India. We undertake an intersectional analysis that examines dynamics between groups of fisherwomen in relation to social-ecological change. We focus specifically on (1) fisherwomen's perspectives about the key drivers of change (e.g., natural disasters and aquaculture) within the social and ecological system of Chilika lagoon; (2) how environmental change is impacting the livelihoods and coping responses of fisherwomen; and (3) how fisherwomen communities are adapting to the ongoing process of change, highlighting in particular the gendered dimensions of out-migration. Our findings demonstrate that fisherwomen's roles and identities are not static and that the impacts of environmental change vary for different groups of fisherwomen. We find that gender intersects with caste, income, geographic location, age, and household membership to create heterogeneous experiences and knowledge that reflects the complexities associated with gender and environmental change. With specific regard to the increase in fisherwomen out-migrating, we show that responses and adaptations to environmental change have gender-differentiated impacts and challenges.",0.3567357822910783,0.478906933262809,0.16139770549728186,0.5289016799168712,0.19768597361517373,0.04028705361095913,0.11522438899540566

Climate change perceptions and adaptive responses of small-scale farmers in two Guatemalan landscapes,"Introduction. The productivity of certain crops such as coffee (Coffea arabica L.), maize (Zea mays) and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is expected to decline in Central America because of climate change. This will impact regional economies and livelihoods of smallholder farmers relying on these crops for their food security and livelihoods. There is a need to understand how climate change is already impacting smallholder farmers in Guatemala in order to promote adaptation measures that will allow them to face these impacts. Objective. The objectives of this study were to characterize two Guatemalan small-scale agricultural systems, describe farmers' perceptions of climate change and impacts, and document their adaptation efforts. Materials and methods. Structured surveys were carried out in households growing coffee or basic grains in Acatenango and Chiquimula landscapes, two climate change vulnerable landscapes, between June and July 2014. The research was based on farmers' perceptions of changes in temperature and rainfall, the impacts related to these changes, and the adaptation actions implemented in response to perceived changes. Results. Results indicated that 95% of farmers perceived changes in climate, and 81% of them considered these changes to have negatively affected their production. Only 41% of farmers had implemented measures to adapt to these changes, mainly those farmers growing coffee. The implemented adaptation measures differed between landscapes , crops, and usefulness against perceived change with tree planting being the most common adaptation practice to buffer against temperature increases. Conclusion. In order to improve the adaptive response of smallholder farmers and to promote the use of practices that increase resilience, it is neecessaryto provide more technical, financial and political support to facilitate the adaptation of small farmers facing climate change.",0.9861024372579664,0.13088745724043682,0.05985891635898777,0.5,0.027942499293654194,0.011838038185464252,0.02768720543725669
Climate change adaptations of shrimp farmers: a case study from southwest coastal Bangladesh,"Sustainability of brackishwater shrimp farming is of paramount importance for socio-economic development of southwest coastal Bangladesh. Here, shrimp farming is predominantly traditional, which is more vulnerable to climate change. Lack of understanding exists regarding the adaptation measures of local shrimp farmers in response to emerging impacts of changing climatic variables. This study provides the perceptions and adaptations of shrimp farmers in changing climatic context. A systematic random sampling method was employed to conduct a total of 240 questionnaire surveys and 60 key informant interviews from six sub-districts (Upazila) of southwest coastal Bangladesh to collect primary data. Changes in climate variables largely affect the shrimp yield by increasing frequency of shrimp disease, causing physical damage to farm structure and deteriorating quality of water. Shrimp farmers try to adapt to those changes in various ways, including increasing pond depth, exchanging tidal water, providing shade using aquatic plants, strengthening earthen dike and netting and fencing around the dike. Shrimp mixed cultivation is the most popular form of shrimp farming in the study area. More emphasis on implementing polyculture shrimp farming is necessary to improve climate change adaptation and to promote sustainability of this aquaculture practice in southwest coastal Bangladesh.",0.8337720668609179,0.2345351341214802,0.12060325067989984,0.3656960241952667,0.23744834258534459,0.050267315711499144,0.06035004117831881
"Adaptation Strategies to Climate Change among Cereal Crop Farmers in Kita, Kayes Region of Mali","The study examined adaptation strategies to climate change among crop farmers in Kita, Kayes region of Mali. A multistage sampling procedure was used to select 109 respondents for the study. Structured interview schedule was used to elicit responses from respondents. Data were analysed using mean, percentages and the Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC). Respondents were mostly male (58.7%), married (93.6%) and had no formal education (87.2%). Average age, household size, farming experience and output were 45.28 +/- 14.78 years, 16.70 +/- 10.65 persons. 29.70 +/- 13.75 years and 2,335.77 +/- 2,139.41tonnes, respectively. Respondents' primarily engage in crop farming (100.0%) with the majority producing at the subsistence level (99.1%), using sole cropping pattern (94.5%). Information sources on climate change effects were NGOs (90.8%) and friends/relatives (39.4%). Knowledge of climate change effects was high (76.4%) and prominent adaptation strategies used were timely planting ((x) over bar =1.93) and planting of short cycled seed ((x) over bar =1.12). Establishing cereal banks (98.4%), building and maintenance of small dams (95.9%), diversifying agricultural production (72.4%) and strengthening early warning systems (70.7%) were never used by most respondents. None of the respondents ever employed the use of zai-planting pits, half-moon (demi-lune) and stone cord as an adaptation strategies owing to inadequate financial capability. Significant relationship existed between farm size (r=0.201, p <= 0.05), household size (r=0.310, p <= 0.01), sources of information (r=0.447, p <= 0.01), knowledge (r=0.326, p <= 0.01) and adaptation strategies.

Farmers' prioritization of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technologies,"Addressing climate change impacts on agriculture is special challenge. There are number of factors that influence the extent to which farmers in a particular location adopt CSA technologies. This study applied a participatory assessment method to assess farmers' preferences and willingness-to-pay for selected CSA practices and technologies in diverse rainfall zones. The study found that farmers' preferences for CSA technologies are marked by some commonalities as well as differences according to their socio-economic characteristics and rainfall zones. The most preferred technologies by local farmers were crop insurance, weather-based crop agro-advisories, rainwater harvesting, site-specific integrated nutrient management, contingent crop planning and laser land levelling. The results also indicate that furriers' preferences and willingness-to-pay are influenced by technologies and their cost of implementation. This study shows the potential for using a participatory CSA prioritization approach to provide information on climate change adaptation planning at local level. (C) 2016 The Authors.

"Impact of Changed Rainfall Patterns Due to Climate Change and Usage of Available Weather Information by Communities Who Face Human Elephant Conflict (HEC) in Udawalawe, Sri Lanka","Purpose: Weather information is essential for farmers who face wild elephant conflict because, since their farming activities and elephant encounters both are influenced by the climate conditions. The weather information needs of such communities are different from normal farmers. The purpose of the study was to examine farmers' point of view towards the particular information needs, perception towards existing information sources, perusing climate change impacts and elephant encounters due to climate change etc., in order to focus the attention of policy makers and meteorologists when planning activities for such small communities. This study was carried out in Panahaduwa and Rathabalagama villages in Udawalawe using a random sample of 50 farmers. Structured questionnaire has been used to collect information. The structured questioner was pre tested with a similar group and local language was used to communicate with respondents. All the respondents were above 18 years old. Both male respondents and female respondents were used to conduct the survey. According to the findings farmers perceive ongoing changes in rainfall pattern in the area. Farmers are more sensitive to changes taken place in local area whereas the level of perception decreases gradually towards countrywide and global climate changes. A majority of farmers has adjusted their crop calendar in response to these changes and perceived that elephant encounters increases in drought periods. Results shown, farmers are aware about the necessity of adaptation of farming practices to face climate change impacts. However, adapting to impacts of climate change while also minimizing the risk of wild elephant damage needs reliable weather information. Even though Farmers use both scientific weather information and traditional knowledge on climate to plan their crop calendar, they rely more on traditional knowledge due to the perceived poor accuracy of weather forecasts. Overall policies and measures are necessary to improve the availability of weather information that facilitates adaptation practices which could reduce damages from elephants as well as extreme weather conditions. Reliable weather information could help their decision making process to achieve a better outcome of production.",0.9550800258784164,0.20477978188669785,0.07078573275024289,0.4242076469223672,0.02724931450855449,0.027259400605448247,0.014116908504675339
Does climate opportunity facilitate smallholder farmers' adaptive capacity in the Sahel?,"In Africa, adaptation will be crucial to offset expected negative climate change impacts on food security and agriculture development. In this study, we combine meteorological data from 18 local stations, field surveys on agricultural practices and agronomic information on the growth of millet to demonstrate the crop suitability to the present climate and the ability of Senegalese farmers to adapt their practices to climate variability, and to disseminate them. From data collected in both 665 villages and 1061 farmers, our study provides quantitative evidence of the responsive adaptation of farmers in the Sahel where the recent resumption of rainfall has provided new agricultural opportunities. Statistical models and cropping simulations show that these farmers innovate by reintroducing and disseminating a long cycle millet cultivar-more suitable for wet environments. We note that although this adaptation is a clear response to recent changes in quantity and distribution of rainfall, its adoption remains limited (50% of the villages visited and 25% of the surveyed agricultural producers have cultivated the new millet variety) and varies strongly within the same climatic context and by characteristics of farmers (willing and capacity), indicating different agricultural strategies (diversification, market exchanges). If land access and development of cash crops are hindrances to the adoption of sanio, poverty is clearly not a barrier and adaptation is not a lever for wealth creation. Such adaptative capacities, together with government incentives for farmers to sustainably adapt to climate change, can be important in reducing climate risks in the coming years.",0.9846986632251595,0.1464622748627461,0.08172519800095218,0.6106990740055209,0.02026598041737314,0.008877381367279748,0.019973480690652978
Maize production under risk: The simultaneous adoption of off-farm income diversification and agricultural credit to manage risk,"Farmers in Pakistan continue to produce maize under various types of risks and adopt several strategies to manage those risks. This study is the first attempt to investigate the factors affecting the concurrent adoption of off-farm income diversification and agricultural credit which the farmers use to manage the risk to maize production. We apply bivariate and multinomial probit approaches to the primary data collected from four districts of Punjab Province in Pakistan. The results show that strong correlations exist between the off-farm diversification and agricultural credit which indicates that the use of one risk management strategy leads to another. The findings demonstrate that education, livestock number, maize farming experience, perceptions of biological risks and risk-averse nature of the growers significantly encourage the adoption of diversification as a risk management tool while farm size inversely affects the adoption of diversification. Similarly, in the adoption equation of credit, maize farming experience, farm size, perceptions of price and biological risks and risk attitude of farmers significantly enhance the chances of adopting agricultural credit to manage farm risks. These findings are important for the relevant stakeholders who seek to offer carefully designed risk minimizing options to the maize farmers.",0.9716730141516512,0.16531086875358444,0.09742531220820902,0.5218745197473458,0.020740170238114457,0.018703610311111125,0.029282337353107413
Drought adaptation measures and their effectiveness at Barind Tract in northwest Bangladesh: a perception study,"Drought is a natural calamity frequently occurs at Barind Tract in northwest Bangladesh and affects both the human and natural life. An initiative has been taken to investigate the drought adaptation scenario practicing in Barind Tract as well as their effectiveness according to farmers' perception. This study is mainly based on primary data collected through a structured questionnaire by surveying the farming households from ten unions of three districts in western Barind. Farmers' perception about the effectiveness of adaptation measures has been measured using a five-point Likert scale. An indexing formula is developed to rank those measures based on their effectiveness level. The study found that several numbers of adaptation measures are practicing in Barind Tract that can be grouped into two classes: (1) adaptation measures implemented by farmers and (2) adaptation measures implemented by the Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA). Maximum measures implemented by farmers are mainly agriculture and economic activities oriented, although most of the farmers are not able to undertake proper adaptation measure by their own initiative due to lack of capacity. On the other hand, BMDA's adaptation approaches are mainly related to development of irrigation, livelihood, food security, and environmental protection. Most of these approaches are found effective, according to farmers' opinion. A few are found not effective mainly due to poor management and implementation. No linear relationship exists between socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and their perceptions regarding effectiveness of the measures. Exploitation of groundwater is found as the major challenge regarding future drought management. Surface water harvesting and lowering the dependency on groundwater might be the potential solution.",0.8912318479468225,0.20716713340849072,0.07950194225869174,0.3148552454715907,0.04413236534318636,0.08756683315955605,0.13875358321827608
"Farmers' perceived efficacy of adaptive behaviors to climate change in the Loess Plateau, China","The impact of climate change is very significant to farmers who depend on natural resources for livelihood. It is essential to have a better understanding of farmers' assessments of the efficacy of adaptive behaviors for formulating appropriate adaptation policies and improving farmers' ability to adapt to climate change. Based on survey data from interviews with farmers in the Loess Plateau, the features of farmers' perceived adaptation efficacy are analyzed. Three multiple linear regression models are used to analyze farmers' perceived efficacy of adaptive behaviors and identify factors influencing those assessments in terms of farmers' demographical and social factors, their perception of climate change, their perception of climate change effects and the average temperature and precipitation from 2005 to 2015 in this area. The results are as follows: (1) Generally, the adaptive behaviors with high perceived adaptation efficacy were used by most respondents. Measures with relatively low perceived adaptation efficacy were not commonly adopted, such as migration, buying insurance, changing planting and harvesting time. (2) The factors affect the perceived efficacy of adaption behavior in decreasing order are as follows: perception of climate change, the average precipitation, and demographical and social factors. Perception of local natural disasters, perception of planting and harvesting time, crop yield and diseases and insect pests caused by climate change were found to affect farmers' adaptation assessments. The key demographical and social factors influencing farmers' assessments were non-farming income, farming income, farmland quantity, gender, the frequency of watching TV and going to the market.

"Farmer portfolios, strategic diversity management and climate-change adaptation - implications for policy in Vietnam and Kenya","Climate variability is contributing to water-scarcity problems in Kenya and to extreme flooding and drought in Vietnam. This paper compares diversity-based climate adaptation approaches in current land use in the Cam Xuyen district, Ha Tinh province, Central Vietnam and in the Kapingazi river watershed in Embu district, Eastern province, Kenya, in order to understand local responses to climate variability and examine the potential for policy support of diversity management by local people. Literature reviews and trend analysis of local time series of rainfall and temperature were combined with stakeholder interviews and workshops to identify technology and policy options for dealing with current and future climate variability. At all study sites, diversity in land use at farm level and along agriculture-forestry landscape gradients was a key strategy. Policy options to support such an approach could include legalization of agroforestry in Vietnam and a combination of regulations and incentive-based approaches to reconcile household decision-making with longer term and collective actions to benefit landscape diversity in Kenya.

"Farmers' adaptation to climate change in Pakistan: Perceptions, options and constraints","Agriculture in Pakistan is extremely vulnerable to climate change. Adaptation of the agriculture sector is imperative as it contributes 20 percent to the GDP and supports directly or indirectly about 68 percent of the population for their sustenance. Farmers' perception about climate change, current adaptation measures, and decision-making process is important for farmers' successful adaptation strategies. Using data of 205 conventional farmers from three district of Punjab province, this study provides insights into farmers' perceptions about climate change, on-going adaptation practices, and constraints to various adaption strategies. We found that majority of the farmers do not consider climate change as a potential threat to agriculture; therefore, they do not make any intentional efforts to change their farming practices. However, a few adaptation measures like use of different crop varieties, tree planting, and drip irrigation methods are prevalent in the research area. The major hurdles that farmers perceived in adaptation are limited access to credit, lack of access to information, and institutional support. As expected, no significant variations were found across districts in the characteristics of respondents (age and income) that can affect their perceptions, their adaptation strategies, and obstacles faced in adaptation. The results of the study need to be interpreted with caution, as we did not focus on other determinants like education, role of media, and government policies that can affect farmers' choices to adopt climate resilient farming practices. © 2018 Sarhad Journal of Agriculture.",0.9796578763801805,0.12528628048579357,0.06611126658009071,0.5,0.04094706236273012,0.018206281100629926,0.015505190992941125

Dealing with rainfall variability for food production in the nigerian savannah,"The chapter investigates the observed and perceived trends and effects of rainfall on food production and identifies options that are adopted by farmers in dealing with the impacts in the Nigerian savannah. Data were sourced via community engagement, key informant interviews, and a survey of 191 farming households from 11 farm settlements in the region. Arithmetic monthly means of rainfall and temperature data from six meteorological stations within the ecological zones were used to generate the past and long-term trends of local climate. The study shows no significant variation of monthly mean rainfall across three decades of the observed data. However, there were similarities between the observed long-term averages of the station data and local perception that the amount of annual rainfall is decreasing, with delay in the onset of rain and increased trend of temperature. The variability impacts land-related livelihoods activities which are substantially tied to rain feeding. Annual planting seasons for cereals is changing from double to single, while harvest of tubers and nuts are gradually reducing. There are no organized adaptation frameworks, but when impacts are perceived by the farmers, coping ensued in the form of crop switch as on-farm modification and charcoal production as a form of off-farm livelihoods diversification.

Climate Change Adaptation Strategies and Constraints in Northern Ghana: Evidence of Farmers in Sissala West District,"Research findings indicate that most African countries are vulnerable to climate change as a result of challenges such as poverty, weather extremes, and insufficient governmental agricultural support. For this reason, the researchers used the Sissala West District as a case study to determine factors influencing farmers' adaptation to climate change and strategies used to avert climate change impact. A total of 330 small-scale farmers were sampled for survey and 150 key informants were used in focus group discussions. Utilizing the logistic regression model, the study indicated irregular rainfall, high temperature, weather information, and high evaporation as the factors that highly influenced farmers' ability to adapt to climate change. A Weighted Average Index used to measure weather extremes revealed that drought and temperature had the highest level of occurrence. Furthermore, climate change adaptation strategies assessed in the study showed that agroforestry practices, drought-resistant crops, and mulching were the most preferred methods. The study concluded that farmers' ability to adapt to climate change can be improved if the Environmental Protection Agency and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture intensify climate adaptation campaigns, increase access to weather information, and train farmers on adaptable strategies including, but not limited to, alternative sources of livelihood.",0.9735773520386838,0.22416056544131216,0.07174000303683167,0.6596237193006816,0.014493047116465424,0.016143920776289084,0.021512849233153334
Smallholder farmers' coping and adaptation strategies to climate change and variability in the central highlands of Ethiopia,"This study describes the different coping and adaptation strategies used by smallholder farmers to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change and variability in the central highlands of Ethiopia. A distinction was made between coping and adaptation strategies, respectively, as short-term and longer term measures. The study surveyed 200 farm households in three districts, and three focus group discussions and three key informant interviews were conducted in each district. All the surveyed farmers perceived at least one aspect of change in the local climate. Their perception of an increasing trend of temperature was supported by meteorological records, while their perception of declining annual rainfall was not supported by actual records in two of the three districts, where positive trends in rainfall were observed. Farmers identified changes in rainfall and drought as their major climate change-related risks. In response, farmers used different strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and variability. The most widely used coping strategy was selling livestock (85% of the respondents), followed by changing consumption pattern (76% of the respondents). Changing crop planting dates was the most preferred adaptation option (89% of the respondents), while irrigation as an adaptation strategy was used only by 10% of the surveyed farmers. Shortage of water for irrigation (83% of the respondents) and shortage of money to buy necessary inputs (77% of the respondents) were the major barriers to effective adaptation frequently cited in the study area. We conclude that adaptation policy should build on existing coping and adaptation strategies and focus on addressing barriers to the adoption of coping and adaptation measures at different scales.",0.9677394201707301,0.1888727087017701,0.06104840596523733,0.6806921392489288,0.01857593674950485,0.020429673240695,0.049177174197141425
"The role of priority non-timber forest products in enhancing local adaptive capacity to climate change stresses in Kilombero district, Tanzania","Climate change is among the key challenges that may influence livelihoods of people in Tanzania. Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) are among the forest products that serve as livelihood resources in the face of climate stresses. However, little is known on the extent to which NTFPs enhance the adaptive capacity of households adjacent to forests in the context of climate stresses. Based on fieldwork in Kilombero District, we investigated how households adjacent to forests use NTFPs as different forms of capital asset to support adaptation strategies for livelihood outcomes. Data were collected using socio-economic appraisal. Three NTFPs out of twelve-firewood, medicinal plants and thatch grasses were identified as priorities because of their immediate importance for supporting households. Priority NTFPs contributed to human, financial and physical capital assets. They also contributed about 3% of the total household annual income. Income and expenditure of priority NTFPs was significantly influenced (p < .05) by age of respondent, household size, distance to resources, change in management regimes of forest and wooded grassland and household income. The households indicated they would use priority NTFPs to improve livelihoods outcomes. Findings in this study can inform policy and support decision makers to establish mechanisms in conservation rules and regulations to enable forest adjacent households to access the NTFPs.",0.7854101015641947,0.2873624271524397,0.15903998435833563,0.6734708360558623,0.048040177338128535,0.02309848798213362,0.03599850159798744
"Resilience, adaptation and expected support for food security among the Malaysian east coast poor households","Purpose Sustainable food security at the household level is one of the emerging issues for all nations. It is expected that the patterns of household resilience factors and adaptation practices have a strong linkage with household food security. The purpose of this paper is to seek an effective technique of adaptation for food security and the required types of support for adaptation to food insecurity among the poor and low-income households in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach This study was based on primary data that were collected in July-October 2012 through a questionnaire survey among 460 poor and low-income households from the Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu states of Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database based on a two-stage cluster random sampling technique. The study considered household food security as household food availability and food accessibility, and ran ordinal regressions to find out the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security. Findings The study concludes that several resilience factors and adaptation practices were statistically significant to household food security, and several external supports were statistically and significantly needed to ensure household food security. Therefore, to ensure sustainable household food security in Malaysia, the food security programs need to be integrated with sustainable development goals (SDGs) and climatic changes adaptation programs, and the involvement of relevant stakeholders are crucial. Originality/value This study is a pioneer work based on primary data that empirically measured the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security in Malaysia. This study also discussed some issues related to the climate change linkage, which would help future climate change research. The findings of the study will be beneficial for all the stakeholders, including policy makers related to the food security and climate change adaptation.",0.8869908533566517,0.28103707391366844,0.06226266791883515,0.5765350198886646,0.04727958516234722,0.04424999289063971,0.05477815963672397
Why Promote Improved Fallows as a Climate-Smart Agroforestry Technology in Sub-Saharan Africa?,"In the literature, a lot is discussed about how agroforestry can achieve the mitigation, adaptation and productivity goals of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). However, this may be relatively too broad to assess the trade-offs and synergies of how specific agroforestry technologies or practices achieve the three pillars of CSA. Here, we provide an overview of how improved fallows (an agroforestry technology consisting of planting mainly legume tree/shrub species in rotation with cultivated crops) may achieve the goals of climate-smart agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Our review showed that improved fallow systems have real potential to contribute to food security and climate change mitigation and adaptation in SSA. Under proper management, improved fallows can increase maize yields to about 6 t ha(-1), which is comparable to conventional maize yields under fertilization. This is attributed to improved soil fertility and nutrient use efficiency. Although data was generally limited, the growing literature showed that improved fallows increased soil carbon sequestration and reduced greenhouse emissions. Further, as a multiple output land use system, improved fallows may increase fodder availability during dry periods and provide substantial biomass for charcoal production. These livelihood options may become important financial safety nets during off seasons or in the event of crop failures. This notwithstanding, the adoption of improved fallows is mainly in Southern and Eastern Africa, where over 20,000 farmers are now using Sesbania sesban, Tephrosia vogelii, and Cajanus cajan in two-year fallows followed by maize rotations. Land tenure issues, lack of social capital, and improved germplasm and accessions of fallow species have been cited as constraints to scaling up. However, development of seed orchards, nursery development, and the willingness of policy makers to create a policy environment that addresses market failures and alleviates disincentives should improve adoption and future scaling up.",0.9295990413308752,0.21962753267304908,0.1149414954678514,0.522423640042042,0.029500418151275024,0.0293229724165921,0.012699613326653364
Forest Dependent Indigenous Communities' Perception and Adaptation to Climate Change through Local Knowledge in the Protected Area-A Bangladesh Case Study,"Forest-dependent indigenous communities rely on natural resources for their livelihoods, but those are currently under threat due to many factors, including the adverse impact of climate change. The present study looks into climate change-related perception and adaptation strategies of three forest-dependent indigenous communities, namely, Khasia, Tripura and Garo in the Lawachara National Park of Northeastern Bangladesh. Household surveys, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and observation methods were used to unveil the climatic events, impacts and related adaptations. The events include the change in temperature and rainfall patterns, landslide, soil erosion and flash flood, heavy cold and fog, and natural calamities. Moreover, livelihood problems emanating from these events are the drying up of streams and wells, irregular rainfall, increased dieback and mortality of seedlings, pests, diseases, and the attack of crops by wild animals. Likewise, the reduction of soil moisture content, growing season and crop productivity, landslides, damage of roads and culverts, and increased human diseases are common. This study recognized 29 adaptation strategies and divided them into six management categories, drawing on their local knowledge of the natural resources and other technologies. The study reveals that, although adaptation strategies through land use and land cover changes are not enough to sustain their livelihoods, the tactics help them to reduce the risk of, and increase food security and community resilience against, climate change.",0.8593509620513146,0.29870597793135645,0.16831941512912307,0.5165185975138458,0.06131743945409497,0.02269637500793349,0.05710808794663119
Factors Impact on Farmers' Adaptation to Drought in Maize Production in Highland Area of Central Vietnam,"This paper assesses factors impact on adaptation to drought in maize production of farmers in Dakrong district - a highland district of Central Vietnam. The study was conducted with 180 farmers, being selected randomly from three communes of the district. Factor analysis and Multinomial Logit regression indicated six main groups of factors impacting on four separate adaptation options (called ADP) in maize production in the area. In which, the increasing in household's capitals, experience, maize production scale, and gender and non-farm income significantly increased the probability of applying at least one adaptation measure in maize production of the farmers.

Climate change and the African livestock sector Emerging adaptation measures from UNFCCC national communications,"Purpose - This paper aims to investigate and review adaptation measures in the livestock sector from 21 African countries through literature survey and grounded theory approaches. The adaptation themes that emerged captured essence of measures and experience drawn from varied country submissions and contexts instituted to make the livestock sector climate compatible in as far as adaptation is concerned. Design/methodology/approach - Literature survey approach was used on the impacts of climate change on livestock and a review of the submitted adaptation measures. The study used grounded theory approach to derive meaning from the retrieved information. The grounded theory was derived inductively through systematic collection and analysis of data pertaining to the submitted National Communications reports. The retrieved themes were then examined and interpreted to give meaning and draw conclusions through coding, conceptualizing, categorizing and theorizing. Findings - Results identify eight adaptation themes: carrying capacity and policies; integrated pasture management; capacity building, extension, training, awareness and information sharing; livestock breeding, diversification and intensification; disease, vectors and parasites management; technology, innovation, research and development; alternative livelihood; and water supply. The findings show that African Governments have been implementing effective adaptation measures for food security through building a climate resilient livestock production system. Originality/value - This study is one of the first to lead to recommendations that decision- and policymakers, private sectors, relevant stakeholders and government officials and scientists should play a key role in ensuring that adaptation measures reach farmers, herders at grassroots level. In addition, governments should create an enabling environment (policies) in climate change adaptation to improve food security. These recommendations might be helpful in many communities where adaptation to climate change is a pressing issue.",0.7175299531273664,0.29155228531258515,0.16090534408949922,0.30496392768012165,0.053105978535443035,0.1860086382481504,0.16995705409840497
"How diversified is cropping in Malawi? Patterns, determinants and policy implications","Micro- and macroeconomic evidence suggest that the promotion of agricultural diversification in agriculture-based developing countries is beneficial. At the microeconomic level, increased agricultural diversification promotes human nutrition and raises household incomes, while allowing farmers to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change. Using Malawi as a case study, we analyzed the recent patterns and determinants of farm level crop diversification in order to better understand how policies impact on diversification and how they can be better formulated or implemented to effectively promote diversification. The study used descriptive and econometric approaches to study crop diversification. Data from two nationally representative household surveys, which covered cropping seasons in 2004/05 and 2010/11, show that crop diversification has deteriorated nationally in different Agricultural Development Divisions (ADDs), although beneficiaries of the widely-implemented Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) have become more diversified. The study also found that crop diversification varies significantly across agro-ecological zones. Results also indicate that deliberately targeted policies lead to more commercially orientated crop diversification. We conclude that further crop diversification could be promoted among different types of farmers with the aim of contributing to economic growth, risk reduction, and nutrition security in Malawi.",0.9214152404555938,0.189864037774727,0.10086691812124855,0.6032694053605175,0.030176483125077765,0.02625084476895759,0.02573943072355508

Adaptation to Climate Change in Panchase Mountain Ecological Regions of Nepal,"Rural mountain communities in developing countries are considered particularly vulnerable to environmental change, including climate change. Forests and agriculture provide numerous ecosystem goods and services (EGS) to local communities and can help people adapt to the impacts of climate change. There is however poor documentation on the role of EGS in people's livelihood and adaptation practices. This study in the rural Panchase Mountain Ecological Region of Nepal identifies practices being used to adapt to a changing environment through key informant interviews and focus group discussions. At the household level, livelihood diversification, changes in cropping patterns and farming practices, use of multipurpose plant species and income-generation activities were identified as adaptation strategies. Among major strategies at the community level were community forestry-based climate adaptation plans of action for forest and water resource management. Landscape-level adaptation strategies were large-scale collaborative projects and programs, such as Ecosystem-based Adaptation and Chitwan Annapurna Landscape conservation; which had implications at both the local and landscape-level. A proper blending and integration of adaptation strategies from individual households through to the community and to the landscape level is needed for implementing effective adaptation in the region.",0.797742578171916,0.2982045670046014,0.20320435517419377,0.5719084970740914,0.09781795663333234,0.03419328416539912,0.09001757575066902
Increasing flexibility in rangeland management during drought,"Extreme droughts like the recent 2011-2013 drought impacting the central and western United States present a challenge to sustaining livestock ranching operations and the ecosystem goods and services they produce. Wyoming ranchers manage half of this drought-prone state and are at the forefront of this challenge. We examined Wyoming ranchers' drought management strategies and how ranch characteristics affect drought management flexibility, a key component of resilience, through a mail survey. We find that many survey respondents manage drought in similar ways, by selling livestock and buying feed, highlighting the market risks associated with drought. Ranches that are larger, include yearling livestock, use shorter grazing periods, and/or incorporate alternative on-ranch activities (e. g., hunting) use more drought management practices and thus have greater flexibility. Larger ranches experience fewer drought impacts, highlighting advantages of a larger resource base. Our findings suggest three components of national drought policy that encourages flexibility and thus increases resilience of ranches to drought: (1) encouraging forage-sharing mechanisms; (2) promoting income diversification that is independent of climatic variability; and (3) facilitating a shift to diversified livestock production systems. These measures could increase sustainability of ranching livelihoods and provision of ecosystem services despite predicted increases in intensity and duration of future droughts.",0.9083646616633898,0.26712390828257776,0.13057753703556885,0.4424672630001488,0.018521586149474314,0.027996117712216058,0.12165442067495896
Understanding actor-centered adaptation limits in smallholder agriculture in the Central American dry tropics,"Adaptations made by agrarian households in the face of global change risks are largely dependent on their livelihood goals. I argue that adaptation-limit research is crucial to many agrarian development programs because a focus on adaptation limits may allow researchers and practitioners to better understand and support successful adaptation and allow smallholders to pursue their goals. In this study of smallholder farming in Northwest Costa Rica, I found that security and the unique parcelero identity of rice farmers in this region define livelihood goals. I show that an understanding of the multidimensionality and fluidity of farmer livelihood goals may enrich our current understanding of actor-centered adaptation limits as insurmountable thresholds. In response to worsening global change risks, farmers in this study traded off certain goals to pursue others. In this way, farmers do not perceive adaptation limits as insurmountable. Alternative indicators of adaptation limits did exist; irreversibility in adaptation and the great hardship associated with tradeoffs among livelihood goals may mark adaptation limits.",0.8512466861955558,0.28491075451669057,0.09235552925048328,0.5742812781962039,0.06014379065475975,0.03391458671382448,0.022176448516521022

Adaptive capacity contributing to improved agricultural productivity at the household level: Empirical findings highlighting the importance of crop insurance,"Understanding the factors that give rise to greater or lesser adaptive capacity among households with in a community could allow government interventions to target the right groups of people. In this paper we study such factors, making use of a household survey administered in the Indian state of Odisha. In the survey, we queried respondents for the adaptations that they had engaged in to deal with the risk of drought, as well as a number of indicators for adaptive capacity taken from the literature. We found a large number of indicators of adaptive capacity to correlate with one or more adaptations taken. However, many of these indicators, while increasing the likelihood that one adaptation would be taken, also decreased the likelihood that another would be taken, and hence were not unambiguous determinants of greater adaptive capacity in general. One indicator, access to crop insurance, stood out as particularly effective: it correlated with an increased likelihood of engaging in two separate yield-raising adaptations, and correlated with a decreased likelihood of engaging in two additional adaptations that would have the effect of reducing yields. The results suggest that further attention to crop insurance may be warranted, as well as further research to determine if the other indicators may be effective in other contextual settings.

"Climate shock adaptation for Kenyan maize-legume farmers: choice, complementarities and substitutions between strategies","Crop failure due to climate shocks increases the risk of hunger for small-scale farmers. This paper identifies the major climate shocks affecting maize-legume farmers in Kenya, and the factors associated with their decision to adapt including the specific adaptation strategies to employ. During 2000-2010 surveyed farm households reported drought, crop pests and excessive rainfall as the most frequent and severe climate shocks. Probit regression results show that previous experiences of drought reduce the likelihood of adaptation to drought and excessive rainfall. Female-headed households are more inclined than male-headed households to adapt to excessive rainfall. Next, multivariate probit regression results identify farm adjustment (e.g. use of improved varieties and replanting) to be a substitution strategy for selling assets and borrowing for drought adaptation, while reducing consumption seems to be a complementary strategy for borrowing. To adapt to crop pests, farm adjustment seems to be a substitution strategy for selling assets and reducing consumption; however, selling assets is a complementary strategy for borrowing. Policy to encourage adaptation should incorporate implication of multiple shocks and target assistance to poor, food-insecure and female-headed households as these are often disadvantaged in terms of asset endowment and access to the technology necessary for adaptation.",0.9161265541233761,0.2120908655158255,0.05988013898586138,0.639765242513395,0.03387686813339201,0.02336656225005824,0.05868439001167756
Erosive coping after the 2011 floods in Kenya,"Periodic river floods have devastating social and economic impacts on poor households in the low-lying coastal and western regions of Kenya. This paper focuses on how households in Bunyala District coped with the impacts of flooding, and particularly the December 2011 River Nzoia flood. The data for the study was collected through a survey of 400 households, three focus group discussions, four in-depth interviews and six key informant interviews. Of the surveyed household-heads, 393 (98.4%) reported negative impacts of the flood on farming, livestock and/or property. Coping strategies at household level included temporary relocation and migration, reduced expenditure on household needs, engagement in extra income-generating activities, selling of property and reliance on support from public and private agencies. The findings reveal that many of the coping measures that people use are erosive, as they have negative long-term effects on household livelihood sustainability.",0.3573310664561499,0.39735201195256925,0.10181064158906045,0.6032311140456362,0.06092709128866976,0.18583214960396616,0.250771186723523
Climate change and farm-level adaptation decisions and strategies in drought-prone and groundwater-depleted areas of Bangladesh: an empirical investigation,"Despite recognizing the vulnerability of Bangladesh's agriculture to climate change, the existing literature pays limited attention to a rigorous, quantitative analysis of farm-level data to investigate rice farmers' preferred adaptation strategies, perceived barriers, and policy implications. By employing data from 1800 Bangladeshi farm-households in eight drought-prone and groundwater-depleted districts of three climatic zones and logit models, this study breaks new ground in investigating farm-level adaptation to climate change. Results showed that farmers' perceptions of climatic variability supported macro-level evidence. Science-driven (e.g., drought tolerant rice), environmental resource-depleting (e.g., groundwater), and crop-switching (e.g., non-rice crops) typified preferred farm-level adaptation strategies to alleviate adverse effects of climate change. Drought severity, extent of groundwater depletion, education level, farm-size, access to climate information, and electricity for irrigation, and agricultural subsidies were significant factors underpinning farmers' decision to adapt. Inadequate access to climate information and scientific research outcomes, limited irrigation facility and resource-base represented major adaptation barriers. Strengthening agricultural research and support services including information accessibility, community-focussed farming education and training for improved crop culture practices, and expanded and efficient surface-water irrigation infrastructure are critically important for creating an effective adaptation process to climate change. Scientific research-driven adaptation measures with stronger support systems appear more sustainable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Climatic and non-climatic factors influencing changing agricultural practices across different rainfall regimes in South Asia,"Using data from a household survey of 2660 farm-families in Bihar state of Eastern India, Terai of Nepal and coastal Bangladesh, we explore the significance of climatic and non-climatic factors in affecting farmers' decision to change their farming practices over time in a wide range of environments. We find evidence across all sites, irrespective of rainfall and climatic stresses, that market-related forces (such as higher yields and better market opportunity) and resource issues (such as declining fertility, labour shortage and biotic factors) have been a strong driver of changes in farming practices over the last ten years relative to climatic factors. Food sufficient households are likely more adaptable to a changing climate, as they are undertaking new agricultural practices. The results suggest that social protection measures aimed at enhancing the food security situation of marginal and smallholder households will increase the likelihood of them being in a better position to innovate and adopt improved agricultural practices. Our findings also indicate that additional strategies and policies aimed at more widespread uptake of new agricultural practices will also be needed, and will have to be targeted to particular environments and vulnerable groups, and special attention to institutional, resource management and market development issues if they are to succeed.",0.8895150785643876,0.2496726250641411,0.08567369854344434,0.5896614220607441,0.04998362131936901,0.037663035522676226,0.02874557815764391

Niche-based responses in addressing the climatic constraints to farm production: analogues to climate-change adaptation in Nepal,"Climate change continues to threaten the lives and livelihoods of small farmers of Nepal. Given the importance of Nepal's agriculture to the nation's economy, potential impacts of climate variability and change on national food security is a cause for concern. Notwithstanding this challenge, efforts are being made to identify the climate-change impacts on agriculture and actions that farmers and their supporting institutions can take to adapt. The repository of local agro-ecological knowledge available across Nepalese communities is worth exploring. This study, through analysis of four examples of innovative agricultural practices - referred to here as niche-based, details the responses of farmers and their supporting institutions to climatic limitations in Nepal. We identify and synthesize commonalities of the four case studies that may be integral to climate-change adaptation as: (1) the need for participation, flexibility and integration of all stakeholders in the process of innovating adaptation technologies; and (2) the potential for farmers (end-users) and their supporting institutions to take on more leadership and responsibility to sustain the effectiveness of adaptation measures.",0.9117672050310618,0.27676196857455715,0.1303731900869928,0.48736093377760115,0.04400299982488527,0.02344296055959093,0.06515953731701155
"Understanding the process of adaptation to climate change by small-holder farmers: the case of east Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia","This study examined smallholder farmers' level of perception about climate change, source of information on climate change, types of adaptation strategies, factors influencing adaptation choices and barriers to adaptation in Eastern Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia. The surveyed farm households in the study area perceived at least one aspect of climate change primarily through their life experience. Planting trees is the major adaptation measure and 89.1 percent of the farmers took this adaptation strategy. Most farmers (96 percent) believe that deforestation is the main cause of climate change and the choice of farmers to plant trees as an adaptation strategy may be partly a mitigation strategy. However, the majority (49.6 percent) of the households employed at least one adaptation response on top of tree planting. The other adaptation strategies include: early planting, terracing, irrigation and water harvesting. The main source of information for these adaptation strategies for 58.4 percent of the respondents is from extension advice. Results of a multinomial logit model showed that non-farm income, farmer- to-farmer extension, access to credit, distance to selling markets, distance to purchasing markets, and income affect the choice of adaptation strategies. Finally, the study identified lack of information as the most important barrier to climate change adaptation. The other barriers include: lack of farm inputs, shortage of land, lack of money, lack of water and shortage of labor. © 2013, Tessema et al.; licensee Springer.",0.9611753052818149,0.15001532796006448,0.08855883670056142,0.5653472478530713,0.033303776420412774,0.021289643576157872,0.036284773759835694

Gender and food security in Bangladesh: the impact of climate change,"Food security remains a critical global issue, made more difficult because of the rising world population, climate challenges affecting food production and a focus on market-based solutions that undermine subsistence production in vulnerable rural areas. Particularly affected are countries across Asia where poverty, hunger and malnourishment affect a significant proportion of the population. Drawing on Sen's entitlement theory, we argue that a shift in focus from national food production to intra-household food access enables a critical reflection on consumption smoothing strategies adopted at this level. In particular, we draw attention to the tendency for women and girls to eat less as an intra-household adaptation strategy. We present findings from our research in rural areas of Bangladesh and note that adaptation strategies adopted by households in response to food insecurity. We note that strategies designed to address food insecurity must include gender mainstreaming to ensure that women and girls are not taking a disproportionate responsibility for intra-household food security. ResumenLa seguridad alimentaria sigue siendo un tema global critico, dificultado mas aun por la creciente poblacion mundial, los desafios climaticos que afectan a la produccion de alimentos y una busqueda de soluciones centrada en los mercados que socava la produccion de subsistencia en las areas rurales vulnerables. Los paises asiaticos donde la pobreza, el hambre y la desnutricion afectan a una proporcion significativa de la poblacion son particularmente perjudicados. Basandonos en la teoria de derechos de Sen, argumentamos que un cambio de orientacion de una produccion de alimentos nacional al acceso de alimentos dentro de los hogares permite hacer una reflexion critica sobre las estrategias de emparejamiento del consumo adoptadas a este nivel. En particular, llamamos la atencion sobre la tendencia de las mujeres y las ninas a consumir menos alimentos como una estrategia de adaptacion intra hogar. Presentamos los resultados de nuestra investigacion en las areas rurales de Bangladesh y notamos las estrategias de adaptacion adoptadas por los hogares en respuesta a la inseguridad alimentaria. Destacamos que las estrategias disenadas para abordar la inseguridad alimentaria deben incluir la incorporacion de la perspectiva de genero para asegurarse de que las mujeres y ninas no esten asumiendo demasiada responsabilidad por la seguridad alimentaria intra hogarena. ??????????????,??????????????????????,??????????????????????????????,???????????????,?????????????????????????????????(Sen)?????,???????????????????????,?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,??????????????????????????,???????????,?????????,??????????????????????????",0.5454104951072527,0.3176193518953564,0.1574279045024026,0.4802719692622482,0.051680029884067655,0.04830506486759606,0.06685689513676224
Household Perceptions about the Impacts of Climate Change on Food Security in the Mountainous Region of Nepal,"This study tried to understand the mountainous households' perception of climate change and its impacts on food security in the Lamjung district of Nepal. The study attempted to find out changes in households food security and daily activities in the face of climate change for the last twenty years. The study started with the 150 household surveys along with participatory rural appraisal to understand the climate change perception of local people and its impact on dimensions of food security. Households expressed different levels of perception in terms of climate change on food security. The result shows that most of the mountainous households experienced increased temperature, less rainfall in winter, an increasing number of natural disasters and the emergence of insects for the last twenty years. They perceived the role of climate change in decreased crop production, decreased dairy products and increased household work. The situation of food security is likely to be more vulnerable to climate change in the future. It was also observed that households have been using different autonomous adaptation measures, such as high yielding crop varieties, enhanced irrigation systems and fertilizers, to cope with the changing climate. Finally, the study recommended policy instruments to enhance food security in the mountainous region amidst changing climate.",0.9333272779260234,0.2156553231911174,0.058816268164058556,0.6584926835740345,0.028194989988259436,0.03234469084050119,0.047816601657676185
Relevant drivers of farmers' decision behavior regarding their adaptation to climate change: a case study of two regions in Cote d'Ivoire,"In addition to many other stressors, climate change has emerged as one of the major threats for smallholder farmers from Toumodi in the center and Korhogo in the north of Cote d'Ivoire. This study examined farmers' adaptation behavior with respect to subjective, socio-demographic, institutional, and physical variables. Focus group discussions with 205 farmers and large-scale surveys involving 800 farmers' households were conducted in both study areas for data collection. The data were analyzed using a categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA), reliability analyses, and binary logistic regression models to determine relevant influences on farmers' adaptation behavior. The results revealed that 77% of farmers perceived high increases in temperature and 75% perceived strong decreases in rainfall over the last 10 years. Farmers in Toumodi perceived more climate change than their colleagues in Korhogo. In addition, farmers from Korhogo perceived more new pests (81%) and new weeds (87%), while those from Toumodi agreed that there were strong changes in flowering and fruiting times (54%). Furthermore, two main adaptation groups were identified: changes in the sowing management and the technical itinerary. The levels of implemented strategies differed significantly across regions. Factors such as the perceived occurrence of new pests and insects and support from national and international organizations were relevant to farmers' decision to adapt to climate change. Moreover, the agro-ecological specificities, the types of food crops, and the owners of livestock had also an influence on farmers' adaptation choices. The appropriate policy response should henceforth integrate these factors to support efficient adaptation processes in response to climate change in Cote d'Ivoire.",0.9899843820759395,0.1406839894382055,0.07075960719684123,0.5476497828344173,0.010119545747167629,0.008717692532599587,0.012176739372375489
Narrowing the rice yield gap in East and Southern Africa: Using and adapting existing technologies,"The importance of rice production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has significantly increased over the past decades. Currently, rice plays a pivotal role in improving household food security and national economies in SSA. However, current rice productivity of smallholder farms is low due to a myriad of production constraints and suboptimal production methods, while future productivity is threatened by climate change, water shortage and soil degradation. Improved rice cultivars and agronomic management techniques, to enhance nutrient and water availability and use efficiencies and to control weeds, have the potential to increase yields. The aim of this study was to assess the relative contribution of such technologies to enhanced rice productivity. Relative yield gains emanating from nutrient, water and weed management were surveyed and calculated from literature. Partial budgeting was used to evaluate viability of fertilizer technology under GAP. Substantial yield gains ranging from 0.5 t ha(-1) to 2.9 t ha(-1) are projected following the use of improved technologies. Relative yield gains decreased in the following order: weed management (91.6%) > organic fertilizer application (90.4%) > bunding (86.7%) > mineral fertilizer application (51.9%) > tied ridges (42.6%). Combining fertilizer with unimproved rice cultivars led to negative returns. The lack of integration of improved technologies, to increase synergies and alleviate socio-economic constraints, largely explained the existing yield gaps. The gains obtained through improved rice cultivars can be further enhanced through application of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), improving nutrient, water and weed management technologies, based on the local resource availabilities of small farms. We therefore propose adapting technologies to local conditions and developing and using rice production decision tools based on GAP to enable rice farmers in SSA to improve resource-use efficiencies and crop productivity at the farm level.

"Trees appropriation, a new challenge for ivorian cocoa cropping? Technical, environmental and land tenure obstacles","Ivorian cocoa producers are faced with a new environmental situation: on the one side, the forest cover has almost completely disappeared as cocoa pioneer fronts progress; on the other side, monocultures are showing their limits and recent climatic evolutions are less suitable to this crop. The conjunction of these different elements has led to a ""structural blockage"". At environmental and socio-political data crossroads, this article describes and analyses the adaptation strategies of cocoa producers in this ""postforest"" context. Farmers practices highlight a recent associated trees introduction dynamic faced with environmental conditions. However, this agroforestry adaptation strategy and particularly the introduction of valuable timber are restrained by technical (low handling of forest trees plantation), environmental (composition of spontaneous regrowth) and land tenure (blurred non forest tree status) obstacles.",0.7226461861240826,0.26175270411481805,0.17579389387479943,0.42383298978685147,0.03875193282210811,0.028224848191074105,0.05195221446127243
Ethno-Practices and Adaptation Strategies for the Mitigation of Climate Change by Arable Crop Farmers in Osun State: Implications for Extension Policy Formulation in Nigeria,"The study investigated methods used by arable crop farmers to mitigate climate change in Osun State, Nigeria. Data were collected with the aid of a structured interview schedule from 120 arable crop farmers selected from 24 communities. Age (b = -.392; p <.05), household size (b =.190; p <.049), income (b =.182; p <.057), sources of information (b =.161; p <.105), and farm size (b =.258; p <.004) were significant with adaptation strategies. Strategies regularly employed included use of different planting dates (88.6%), multiple cropping (73%), and cover cropping (55%). The study concluded that arable crop farmers use sustainable methods to ameliorate climate change to the advantage of their production. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",0.9702402734459574,0.219480760572309,0.09226460312765546,0.6306491689463378,0.03350691944080166,0.018395789630077646,0.019249159599535326
Adaptive Rangeland Decision-Making and Coping with Drought,"Grazinglands support the livelihoods of millions of people around the world, as well as supply critical ecosystem services. Communities reliant on rain-fed rangelands are potentially the most vulnerable to increasing climate variability given their dependence on highly climate-sensitive resources. Droughts, which are gradual natural hazards, pose substantial and recurrent economic and ecological stresses to these systems. This study examined management decision-making based on survey responses of 479 California ranchers to: (1) identify the types of drought strategies in-place across California's rangelands and the operation variables driving strategy selection; and (2) examine how individual drought adaptation is enhanced by decision-making factors. Four types of in-place drought strategies were identified and ordered along a gradient of increasing intensity (number) of practices used. Significant background variables driving strategy selection were operation experience with drought, type of livestock operation, grazing system, and land ownership types. Information resource networks, goal setting for sustainable natural resources, and management capacity all acted to enhance individual drought adaptation-defined here by active drought planning and the number of both reactive and proactive drought practices used. Overall, analyses revealed that flexibility in management is a key component of adapting to and coping with drought. Climate policy planning should take into account the diversity of strategies that have been developed by ranchers for multiple generations and within the context of their unique operations, as well as support these working landscapes via a range of adaptation and mitigation options to reduce vulnerability across all types of operations.",0.7538125852800989,0.28182069349351374,0.1234985111169543,0.38401608597652576,0.08237296869051404,0.07389613862151523,0.1281020440939026
Unravelling coastal people's adaptation to salinity: evidence from Bangladesh,"Salinity as a slow onset climate change induced disaster is affecting coastal agriculture in multifarious ways. This study intends to explore various adaptation strategies that coastal people adopt to cope with the increasing saline water intrusion. To serve this purpose, the study conducted a survey with 318 landless people, 195 women and 123 men, selected purposively from two southwest coastal villages of Bangladesh. A five-point ordinal level Likert scale has been used to analyse data. Change in land use pattern, use of modern technology in agriculture, diversification of crops and income sources, using savings and harvesting rainwater were some of the adaptation strategies common in the study areas. The study found that women's ability to adapt is seriously compromised by their limited access to capital. So it is vital that the government take up specific programmes to enhance their adaptation capacity through increasing income generating activities and credit opportunities.",0.7939986177898501,0.28201035471811897,0.07767644330146449,0.5686861648167062,0.2134648528380789,0.06107870112639591,0.08866528057560799
"Sustainability of transhumance grazing systems under socio-economic threats in Langtang, Nepal","The decline or loss of traditional social-ecological systems may induce adverse effects to the societies and ecosystems. Transhumance, the recurring and seasonal movement of grazing livestock, is increasingly constrained by a numbers of factors including policy, land use and socio-economic changes in Nepal. To explore how these changes have affected the transhumance, this study investigated transhumance at the Langtang valley in central Nepal. The specific objectives of this study were to determine the herd size and composition, spatial-temporal patterns and to identify the major drivers of the system and the system changes. Data were collected from field study comprising semi-structured interviews with the herders, focus group discussions, key informants survey, and observations of rangeland and livestock management systems. The study revealed that the transhumance system in the Langtang is influenced by two types of drivers. In one hand, traditional practices are contributing to the sustainability of the system. On the other hand, the grazing patterns and adaptive responses are strongly influenced by changes in government policies, socioeconomic and cultural transformation, livestock productivity, markets, rangeland conditions and climate change. The findings of this study help with the development and implementation of transhumance management policy for the sustainability.",0.8201704280071109,0.2919278956579859,0.17796095143661372,0.5128193595736144,0.0611360549921427,0.026748820953528183,0.09203676945879817
Strengthening threatened communities through adaptation: insights from coastal Mozambique,"Change is a defining characteristic of coastal social-ecological systems, yet the magnitude and speed of contemporary change is challenging the adaptive capacity of even the most robust coastal communities. In the context of multiple drivers of change, it has become increasingly important to identify how threatened communities adapt to livelihood stressors. We investigate how adaptation is negotiated in two coastal fishing communities by documenting livelihood stressors, household assets, adaptive strategies, and factors that facilitate or inhibit adaptation. Declining catch is the most common stressor being experienced in both communities, however, socioeconomic, e. g., disease or theft, and ecological, e. g., severe storms and drought, changes are also creating livelihood stress. We find that specialized fishers' with higher investment in fishing gear and government support are adapting by intensifying their fishing efforts, whereas poorer fishers with more livelihood options are adapting through diversification. Adaptation is facilitated by fishers' groups, occupational pride, and family networks. It is inhibited by limited assets, competition over declining resources, and pervasive poverty. Our data suggest that adaptation is a heterogeneous process that is influenced by multiple factors. Understanding the complexity of fishers' responses to livelihood stressors is critical for fostering adaptive capacity in coastal communities, for strengthening fisheries management, and for improving the livelihoods of fishing dependent communities.",0.5530902661295921,0.4590806760909109,0.15669880513386925,0.5391795582152658,0.8481785635216638,0.08579045020654959,0.07278572443026803
Climate-Smart Agricultural Practices (CSA) Adoption by Crop Farmers in Semi-arid Regions of West and East Africa: Evidence from Nigeria and Ethiopia,"The study was designed to scientifically identify two analogous African sites in semi-arid regions experiencing climate change so as to share their common experiences and then document CSA practices adopted in these regions. It identified analogous sites in Nigeria and Ethiopia for the purpose of studying their climate change adaptation experiences; assessed the socio-economic attributes of crop farmers in the semi-arid regions of these countries under stress and risk of climate change; ascertained the perception of crop farmers on climate change risks in the areas and then described the CSAs adopted in the two analogous sites. Identification of sites were done using GIS tool called CCAFs. Then 120 crop farmers each were randomly selected from the two countries (240 farmers) in a stratified manner. Primary data were collected with the aid of Focus Group Discussion method, a set of structured questionnaire and interview schedule after validating the questionnaire. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and ranking techniques; analysis of variance and t test. It was found that the socioeconomic attributes of farmers in Ethiopia and Nigerian farms varied especially with respect to food assess, types of crops cultivated, household size, education and extension contacts even though major crops in the regions were similar (sorghum, maize, millet and sesame). The two countries had similarities in the adoption of CSAs with the most common CSAs being crop rotation, agro-forestry, adoption of water management techniques, terracing/bunding and contour cropping. In Nigerian farms, while changing of planting dates (76%), diversification of crops (71%) and planting of high resistant varieties (82%) were common CSAs adopted by the farmers, Ethiopian farmers did not adopt these on a high scale. There was no difference in rate of adoption of CSAs in the two countries. It was recommended that farmers should be assisted to build capacities in applying more reliable CSAs such as use of drought tolerant varieties of seeds, improved water management techniques, and to have better access to early warning information on climate; irrigation facilities and finance. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",0.9894327712643536,0.1312731230213435,0.06603005342761437,0.6458657075077051,0.021713502195581935,0.007926627574129695,0.03749465268780719
Adaptive capacity to climate change in the wine industry: A Bayesian Network approach,"This study assesses the main factors influencing the behavior of wine producers and the strategies implemented by them with regard to changing climatic conditions. To do so, we adopted a Bayesian Network combining climatic, technical, and economic factors, as well as farmer perception and environmental actions. Based on the scientific literature reviewed, a set of research hypotheses was formulated and compared with empirical evidence collected in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna. Climatic data, both at the regional and vineyard levels were collected and primary information on wine growing and wine making firms was gathered by means of a producer survey, including 56 wine farms. The results showed that the probability to be negatively affected by the effects of climate change is influenced by structural and technical farm characteristics and by farmer readiness to embrace change. Local climatic conditions, particularly temperature and water surplus, are the factors that most affect both wine production and adaptation behavior in the study area. We conclude that the adoption of focused management and appropriate adaptation strategies, as well as appropriate policies with regard to regulation, incentives and support, are crucial issues for farmers to face the ongoing climatic challenge. © 2018 UniCeSV, University of Florence",0.8353182230981202,0.25228882706235856,0.11075757826220076,0.4537436978435756,0.04203682625369899,0.034055914344032406,0.11107796485724179
Adaptations in irrigated agriculture in the Mediterranean region: an overview and spatial analysis of implemented strategies,"In order to meet future food demand while sustainably managing available land and water resources, irrigated agriculture in semi-arid regions needs to adapt as a response to climate and socio-economic change. In this study, we focus on the Mediterranean region, a dynamic region, which is highly dependent on irrigated agriculture. We provide insight on adaptation strategies implemented on farm level, by doing a systematic review of studies in the region. Our analysis reports 286 implemented adaptations, on 124 different locations throughout the Mediterranean. Additionally, 142 drivers and 324 effects of adaptations were noted. We identified 31 adaptation strategies in 5 main categories: (1) water management, (2) sustainable resource management, (3) technological developments, (4) farm production practices, and (5) farm management. Strategies in the categories water management and farm production practices are most often implemented by farmers in the region. The main driver in the area is water scarcity and adaptations often affected water use and resources in addition to farm practices. Subsequently, we studied the spatial context of adaptations by analyzing the location factors of the five main strategies, using Geographic Information Systems and maximum entropy modeling. Our results show that farmers are more likely to adapt in less rural areas with lower poverty values and better market access, and in areas with higher temperatures and less rainfall. This demonstrates that both biophysical and socio-economic factors determine the context in which adaptations are implemented and that considerable spatial variability in the area exists.",0.9385219083230788,0.20492225967739824,0.17664332450949524,0.5,0.03622641796053629,0.034493481302718294,0.31466785091383487
Adaptation strategies of coastal fishing communities as species shift poleward,"In this period of environmental change, understanding how resource users respond to such changes is critical for effective resource management and adaptation planning. Extensive work has focused on natural resource responses to environmental changes, but less has examined the response of resource users to such changes. We used an interdisciplinary approach to analyse changes in resource use among commercial trawl fishing communities in the northwest Atlantic, a region that has shown poleward shifts in harvested fish species. We found substantial community-level changes in fishing patterns since 1996: southern trawl fleets of larger vessels with low catch diversity fished up to 400 km further north, while trawl fleets of smaller vessels with low catch diversity shrank or disappeared from the data set over time. In contrast, trawl fleets (of both large and small vessels) with higher catch diversity neither changed fishing location dramatically or nor disappeared as often from the data set. This analysis suggests that catch diversity and high mobility may buffer fishing communities from effects of environmental change. Particularly in times of rapid and uncertain change, constructing diverse portfolios and allowing for fleet mobility may represent effective adaptation strategies.",0.5584829076897119,0.36720827032592246,0.17214395121059242,0.43541413579972077,0.19606877160430586,0.03280394275086318,0.08328524692513845

Linking climate change perceptions to adaptation and mitigation action,"One of the main contributors to anthropogenic climate change is agriculture, although, paradoxically, the sector is also very vulnerable to climate change effects, in particular extreme weather events. The agricultural sector can however make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation through increasing or sustaining soil carbon levels. The perception and action of farmers to anticipated climate change may be a significant determinant of both climate change impacts and mitigation efforts in agriculture. This is the first national-scale study of the perception of climate change by farmers and their associated farming practices regarding mitigation and adaptation. We find that Danish farmers realise that climate change will affect them in the future, and that many are already affected and are taking action to prevent future losses. Almost one fourth of the farmers surveyed stated that they include climate change mitigation in soil management planning. The majority of Danish farmers are already adapting to the effects of climate change, especially through maintaining or expanding drainage areas to reduce the impact of heavy rain, but also by changing soil management practices to increase water infiltration capacity. The study reveals the paradoxical finding that farmers, although believing that climate change is real, and having experienced losses due to adverse climatic events, do not tend to connect the two phenomena. Also there seems to be no link between perceptions of climate change and adaptation/mitigation action. Knowledge gained from this study can be useful for future policymaking on the effect of farm management practices in relation to climate change. Acknowledging farmers' attitudes and beliefs may be an important component in understanding the responsiveness of the agricultural sector to initiatives to reduce emissions from farming and to improve the robustness of agricultural systems to climate change.",0.9165483367427307,0.2031631575057313,0.12939765732038683,0.28909100070444027,0.029329219555481335,0.03268082426672015,0.032844100771040725
Diversification Under Climate Variability as Part of a CSA Strategy in Rural Zambia,"Climate change is posing an increasingly severe challenge to agricultural livelihoods due to increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Livelihood diversification can play an important role in decreasing food insecurity and vulnerability under these challenges. This paper contributes to the literature on livelihood diversification and vulnerability under climate change to assess the role of diversification as part of a Climate-Smart Agriculture strategy by analysing the determinants of diversification, income and poverty in Zambia using panel data.

Farmers' responses to climate change impact on water availability: insights from the Indrawati Basin in Nepal,"There is a need to assess the potential impacts of climate change on agriculture in order to plan appropriate adaptation measures. Farmers are already adapting to these changes to a certain degree. This article presents a case study of rainfed and farmer-managed irrigated agriculture in the Indrawati Basin, Nepal. It describes farmers' perceptions of climate change, an analysis of historical water availability, and future projections of temperature and precipitation. Adaptation strategies already being used by farmers are identified and new ones are recommended based on primary information collected from farmers and an in-depth analysis of the climate data.",0.935807429860918,0.18165807151637572,0.10528659315725508,0.42421633941186243,0.013968391717371197,0.024034180799517395,0.07801088278786038
"Adaptive capacity of small-scale coffee farmers to climate change impacts in the Soconusco region of Chiapas, Mexico","This paper identifies conditions of social vulnerability and climate-related disaster risk in the Huehuetan River basin, Chiapas, Mexico and analyses the capacity of small coffee producers to adapt to hydrometeorological hazards. Small-scale farmers in the basin use various strategies to adapt to the impacts of such hazards and to confront the deterioration of their livelihoods, including diversifying the varieties of coffee they cultivate, diversifying their sources of income, and emigration. Analysis of these strategies suggests that high levels of poverty, coffee monoculture, food insecurity, and instability in sources of employment and income combine to limit the flexibility and stability of population's adaptive capacity. The strategies employed by local people have allowed for short-term subsistence but offer little chance of long-term sustainability. Conditions do not appear to reduce social vulnerability and, in fact, undermine local resilience that would reduce damage and risks from extreme climate events. The impacts of climate change are placing the region's small farmers in a very vulnerable situation from which it may be difficult to escape, without the implementation of social reform predicated on greater justice and social equality, which will require political will. This case illustrates the challenges that must be addressed in order to overcome the social inequalities that prevent small-farmer communities from reducing their vulnerability in the face of climate-(or non-climate-) related risks.",0.7959605707899574,0.3228445248866423,0.12573744899046266,0.5971147214109661,0.1253831340158852,0.044391461433797366,0.16071017027029103
Review of livestock farmer adaptations to increase forages in crop rotations in western France,"Since the 1960s there has been a global trend toward specializing and intensifying farming systems in order to produce more food. However, harmful environmental consequences have been recognized. Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) are now being reconsidered as a means of improving farm and land sustainability. We suggest that understanding interrelations of ICLS to achieve sustainability requires scrutinizing the way farmers exploit them to adapt their farming system. We used six different case studies covering maritime and semi-maritime regions of France (beef and dairy + crop systems) to describe factors influencing production, environmental, and socio-economic considerations for change in farming practices. Farm surveys and analysis of farmers' practices and farm time-course of change were framed within the European farming system approach. Transition in the medium-term pointed out new interactions at stake between crops and livestock when farmers developed adaptation to climate changes, introduced grassland in contrast to the general trend of specialization and enhanced feed self-sufficiency. In the medium- and short-term, multifunctionality of crops and crop rotation adjustments, as well as regulation of cropping systems by livestock classes are the main levers of system flexibility. We showed how ICLS increased sustainability and began to notice the positive effects of farm collaboration. Further research is needed in partnership with additional stakeholders to support sustainable development of agriculture at the landscape level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Geographic Information and Communication Technologies for Supporting Smallholder Agriculture and Climate Resilience,"Multiple factors constrain smallholder agriculture and farmers' adaptive capacities under changing climates, including access to information to support context appropriate farm decision-making. Current approaches to geographic information dissemination to smallholders, such as the rural extension model, are limited, yet advancements in internet and communication technologies (ICTs) could help augment these processes through the provision of agricultural geographic information (AGI) directly to farmers. We analysed recent ICT initiatives for communicating climate and agriculture-related information to smallholders for improved livelihoods and climate change adaptation. Through the critical analysis of initiatives, we identified opportunities for the success of future AGI developments. We systematically examined 27 AGI initiatives reported in academic and grey literature (e.g., organisational databases). Important factors identified for the success of initiatives include affordability, language(s), community partnerships, user collaboration, high quality and locally-relevant information through low-tech platforms, organisational trust, clear business models, and adaptability. We propose initiatives should be better-targeted to deliver AGI to regions in most need of climate adaptation assistance, including SE Asia, the Pacific, and the Caribbean. Further assessment of the most effective technological approaches is needed. Initiatives should be independently assessed for evaluation of their uptake and success, and local communities should be better-incorporated into the development of AGI initiatives.",0.6229508633107547,0.3213248315413493,0.12996211272543998,0.4045805628582879,0.07823275338656191,0.06678793141642819,0.08753416991608046
IRRIG-OH: AN OPEN-HARDWARE DEVICE FOR SOIL WATER POTENTIAL MONITORING AND IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT,"Sustainability of irrigation practices is an important objective to be pursued in many countries, especially in regions where water scarcity causes strong conflicts among different water uses. The efficient use of irrigation water is a key factor in coping with the food demands of an increasing world population and with the negative effects of climate change on water resource availability in many areas. In this complex context, it is important that farmers can rely on instruments and practices that enable a better management of water at the field scale, whatever the irrigation method they adopt. In this paper, we present an open-hardware device based on the Arduino technology that was developed to allow the continuous monitoring of soil water potential in the root zone for supporting irrigation scheduling at the field scale. The structure of the device is flexible and can be adapted to host different types of sensors. The results, obtained managing irrigation in a peach orchard, show that adoption of the device, together with a simple irrigation scheduling criterion, allowed a significant increase of water use efficiency without causing a reduction of the quantity and quality of crop production.

Household food security in the face of climate change in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan region,"This study attempts to understand local people's perceptions of climate change, its impacts on agriculture and household food security, and local adaptation strategies in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, using data from 8083 households (HHs) from four river sub-basins (SBs), i.e. Upper Indus (Pakistan), Eastern Brahmaputra (India), Koshi (Nepal) and Salween and Mekong (China). The majority of households in SBs, in recent years, have perceived that there have been more frequent incidences of floods, landslides, droughts, livestock diseases and crop pests, and have attributed these to climate change. These changes have led to low agricultural production and income, particularly in Eastern Brahmaputra (EB) where a substantial proportion of HHs reported a decline in the production of almost all staple and cash crops, resulting in very low farm income. Consequently, households' dependency on external food items supplied from plain areas has increased, particularly in the Upper Indus (UI) and EB. After hazards, households face transitory food insecurity owing to damage to their local food systems and livelihood sources, and constrained food supply from other areas. To cope with these, HHs in SBs make changes in their farming practices and livestock management. In EB, 11 % of HHs took on new off-farm activities within the SB and in SM, 23 % of HHs chose out-migration as an adaptation strategy. Lastly, the study proposes policy instruments for attaining sustainable food security, based on agro-ecological potential and opportunities for increasing agricultural resilience and diversity of livelihoods.",0.979452880306281,0.2272438448967762,0.07749225103577927,0.6634661627292181,0.03287150302625597,0.009821954858219333,0.04003456907088066
Smallholders' adaptations to droughts and climatic variability in southeastern Mexico,"This study explores the temporal and spatial variability and change in rainfall across southeastern Mexico and the mechanisms by which smallholder farmers adapt to this variability, especially droughts. Members of 150 households in 10 communities were interviewed to investigate adaptation strategies among swidden maize smallholders, linked to their perceptions of climate changes. Precipitation data from seven weather stations were analyzed for the 1973-2012 period. Precipitation anomalies were estimated to evaluate the annual and seasonal stability, deficit, or surplus; and linear regressions were used to evaluate trends. Then, these anomalies were linked to variation in reported agricultural practices. Weather station data show a considerable decline in precipitation in most of the study area, coupled with increased drought frequency and an increase in negative anomalies in recent years. Surveys revealed several mechanisms of adaptation, including adjustment of the agricultural calendar (e.g. delaying planting, combined with planting a greater number of varieties of maize), water storage, and livelihood diversification both within and outside of agriculture. These adaptive mechanisms are responsive to demonstrated climatic change over the past 40 years, though globalization affects Mexico's agrarian economy, and farmers likely respond to a combination of economic and climatic factors. Understanding how resource- and climate-dependent swidden farmers respond to co-occurring climatic and economic changes is essential for effective adaptation policy design.",0.965377949263996,0.20322654622474093,0.07788264415070736,0.5966111439387587,0.03803382585869012,0.010330163880191536,0.03121085705203842
Knowing Climate Change: Local Social Institutions and Adaptation in Indian Groundwater Irrigation,"How do farmers understand and predict weather variability; in what ways are local weather prediction techniques institutionalized (e.g., in new agricultural practices or cropping decisions) to meet the agricultural challenges of climate change-induced socioecological variability; and how do these vary across space, according to socioecological difference? This article examines these questions through a case study examination of local weather prediction methods and adaptive strategies to ongoing weather-related variability by groundwater-dependent, irrigating farmers in Rajasthan, India. Conducted in 2009 and 2011, the work finds, first, that farmers rely on multiple local methods of weather prediction, which, along with multiple and often conflicting social and ecological factors, inform their cropping decisions. Second, these prediction methods and associated cropping strategies interact with a number of strategies to mitigate weather and agrarian variability more generally, such as new cropping strategies, seasonal migration, and market articulations. The article advances our thinking about what climate change, as yet another (but perhaps unique) agrarian perturbation, means for farmers' livelihoods. It concludes with a discussion of the implications of the analysis for formal climate change adaptation strategies and related ongoing groundwater policy.",0.814396832320334,0.29089508023574384,0.09357958429836544,0.5,0.030712431119405185,0.032802252834078116,0.01901075789648881
"Anticipatory adaptation and the role of decadal climate information in rural African livelihood systems Lessons from the Mid-Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe","Purpose - This study aims to explore the utility of anticipatory adaptation to climate variability and related livelihood sensitivities in rural African contexts using the case of Mbire district situated in the mid-Zambezi valley region of Zimbabwe. The provision of decadal climate information (up to ten years), as part of an anticipatory adaptation package, is at the centre of analysis. Design/methodology/approach - The study used semi-structured and key informant interviews, with a total of 45 semi-structured interviews being conducted with randomly selected long-term communal farmers in the case study area. Whilst data from semi-structured interviews was arranged in Microsoft Excel, thematic analysis was used in analyzing all data. Findings - Anticipatory adaptation and decadal climate projections are shown to potentially enhance flexibility in adaptation planning vis-alpha-vis responding to climate variability and other challenges, as well as reduce chances of maladaptation in responding to climate challenges in the context of multiple and reinforcing stresses and shocks. Originality/value - Anticipatory adaptation, with its three main pillars of future analysis, flexibility of strategies and proactive action, is emerging as key in assisting adaptation planning, the harnessing of opportunities and decision-making vis-alpha-vis responding to climate uncertainties and related livelihood sensitivities. Yet there have not been much empirically grounded analyses in understanding the role of anticipatory adaptation in rural Africa. This study therefore adds to evidence-based analyses towards understanding the role and utility of anticipatory adaptation in local communities in Africa.",0.6911673228800732,0.33747117062682086,0.09688403518150611,0.48093729199513324,0.07734109604779962,0.06720126035340293,0.12278266806131434
Approaches to climate change adaptation of vulnerable coastal communities of India,"In the context of developing countries, climate change and variability poses a serious threat to the coastal rural communities due to their poor adaptive capacities, weak implementation of developmental activities, and lack of technological solutions needed to address this challenge. In order to address the current vulnerabilities of these coastal communities where development initiatives are itself lacking, adaptation measures will play a crucial role in streamlining and collaborating with development initiatives. Literature review in Indian context suggests that there are no estimates available of impact of climate change on coastal agriculture and fisheries and therefore on agricultural, pastoral, and fishing communities. This research addresses the aforementioned research gap with a case study from Western India focusing on livelihood security and human well-being while integrating development plans to climate change adaptation. Based on vulnerabilities identified for the study areas, adaptation plan consisting of goals with several measures were created which were linked to existing national development schemes along with their co-benefits and barriers to implementation. Development choices made today will influence the adaptive capacity of people in the future. Thus, there is an urgent need to undertake development activities and decision making with climate lens, and this research will be the first step in the process. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",0.38165788804851697,0.3862758200941966,0.1150668163421706,0.35134876890173117,0.20093369138318617,0.1689156139224471,0.12381526463185688
"Climatic trends, risk perceptions and coping strategies of smallholder cattle farmers in some villages of Bhutan","Climate change and variability is a global issue, and it affects the small subsistence farmers of Himalayan developing countries like Bhutan. We used a set of semi-structure questionnaire to interview the farmers to understand and analyze local perceptions and reactive responses adapted to climate uncertainties in some villages of Bhutan. Farmers were aware of climate change, and radio and television were identified as the main sources of climate change/global warming related information. In general, farmers have observed rainfall anomalies and prolong dry seasons for the past decades and these were the main threats to their livestock farming. Increased diseases and parasites incidence were also observed, which may be related rising in temperature. Households faced an increasing water shortage and insufficient forage supply that attributed to poor cattle health and cattle production. Farmers are using different coping strategies to adapt to change; these are the plantation of supplementary forage resources, providing concentrated high protein feed and practicing forest grazing. However, we found that adaptation to climate change by Bhutanese farmers’ was influenced by socio-economic and political dynamics. © 2016, Fundacion CIPAV.

Climate Variability and Household Adaptation Strategies in Southern Ethiopia,"This paper examines the determinants and implied economic impacts of climate change adaptation strategies in the context of traditional pastoralism. It is based on econometric analysis of survey data generated from household level interviews in southern Ethiopian rangelands. Pastoralists' perception of climate change in the region is found to be very consistent with the actually recorded trends of increased temperature and the evident secular declines in precipitation. Not only long-term declines, trends in the region's rainfall also appear to have taken a shift towards the direction of more unpredictability. Pastoralist adaptation response strategies broadly involve adjustments in pastoral practices and shifts to non-pastoral livelihoods. Results of the estimated models confirm that pastoral mobility is still quite essential in the present context of climate-induced household vulnerabilities. Increased mobility and diversification of pastoral herd portfolios in favor of a drought-tolerant species (camel) are found to be positively associated with pastoral household net income. A policy stance that ignores the detrimental impacts of the currently pervasive private rangeland enclosures or intends to hasten pastoralist sedentarization in the area is simply untenable in the present context of climate-induced risks and pastoral livelihood vulnerability.",0.7704458483197771,0.31644903539667296,0.09031817297633996,0.602201284070286,0.08169372349613448,0.0366792678939955,0.04568858161819785
Livestock Diversification: an Adaptive Strategy to Climate and Rangeland Ecosystem Changes in Southern Ethiopia,"Pastoral cattle production in southern Ethiopia is becoming increasingly vulnerable to impacts of climate variability and rangeland resource degradation, giving rise to livestock diversification. Using a household (n = 242) survey among herders, the relative functions, adaptability and vulnerability of four livestock species and factors influencing livestock diversification were analyzed. The stated major drivers of livestock diversification were recurrent droughts, bush encroachment, increased vulnerability of cattle and growing demand for adaptive species. Different livestock species are kept to fulfill various livelihood priorities with subsistence objectives outweighing production goals of the herders. Adaptability and vulnerability analyses of the livestock species showed camels and cattle to be the most and least adaptable species, respectively. Livestock species diversification varied significantly with family size and per capita holding of cattle, implicating the influence of labor and economic factors on adoptions. Multispecies herding emerged as the dominant local adaptation strategy, likely because it enhances resilience of households to climate and rangeland ecosystem changes by broadening the set of existing strategies.",0.9081846097556298,0.25708381224521354,0.11362625677912404,0.5186553389183276,0.04732298760522993,0.018488675653468276,0.017473470619875107
The acceptability of climate change in agricultural communities: Comparing responses across variability and change,"This study examined how the terms used to describe climate change influence landholder acceptability judgements and attitudes toward climate change at the local scale. Telephone surveys were conducted with landholders from viticultural (n = 97) or cereal growing (n = 195) backgrounds in rural South Australia. A variety of descriptive and inferential statistics were used to examine the influence of human-induced climate change and winter/spring drying trend terms on adaptation responses and uncertainties surrounding climate change science. We found that the terms used to describe climate change leads to significant differences in adaptation response and levels of scepticism surrounding climate change in rural populations. For example, those respondents who accepted human induced climate change as a reality were significantly more likely to invest in technologies to sow crops earlier or increase the amount of water stored or harvested on their properties than respondents who accepted the winter/spring drying trend as a reality. The results have implications for the targeting of climate change science messages to both rural landholders and communities of practice involved in climate change adaptation planning and implementation.

"Perceptions of Climate Change and the Potential for Adaptation in a Rural Community in Limpopo Province, South Africa","Perceptions of climate change by rural communities are centered on observations of variations in temperature and rainfall patterns supported by observations and projections on climate alterations in the form of increased temperatures and scarce rainfall by scientists worldwide. The present study documented perceptions of climate variation and the community's ability to adapt to climate change hazards threatening the production of subsistence crops. Data were collected through interactions with 100 participants. In the study, climate change is explained as variations in temperature and rainfall patterns which resulted in excessive heat, erratic rainfall patterns and drought negatively impacting on subsistence crop production. Community members have the potential to limit the impacts of climate hazards on subsistence crop production. The negative impacts of climate hazards are limited by community members' indigenous knowledge of rainfall prediction, the seasons, crop diversification and mixed cropping. Mulching and the application of kraal manure improve the soil structure and fertility to reduce crop failure. These adaptation measures are resilient to the negative impact of climate hazards and may be helpful in the development of adaptation policies to assist rural communities vulnerable to climate change hazards.",0.873528060392957,0.31365960435235174,0.08383243497268501,0.5531433404038129,0.06722038100574969,0.018045947584361927,0.04824925409147619
Enhancing rural food security through improved beekeeping in Northern Tanzania,"The study was conducted to assess the potential of improved honey bee production in addressing food security and poverty challenges at household level within some selected villages of Arumeru district in Northern Tanzania. Socio-economic interviews, field surveys and participant observations were used to collect required information from the study area. It was revealed that majority of local people at Arumeru have already experienced food scarcity and the threat is likely to escalate if appropriate measures will not be addressed immediately. The main causes of this shortage have been reported to associate with poor institutional arrangements, low household income and climate change impacts. Adoption of beekeeping was realized to be appropriate adaptation measures following the fact that it improved livelihood of local people and enhanced sustainable conservation of the natural environment. However, this eco-technology was reported to be less exploited in Arumeru district despite of various existing potentials such as market availability, high abundance of bee forages and its compatibility with traditional farming systems. It was further noted that presence of many bee colonies at Arumeru could be useful to enhance food security through improved crop pollination and generation of extra household income from sales of bee products. The study also determined several factors that have been barriers to wider adoption of beekeeping at Arumeru. These include lack of appropriate beekeeping skills among local people, financial constraints and environmental factors. To promote and sustain beekeeping among rural communities at Arumeru, improvement of extension services, tree planting campaign and microfinance services have been suggested in this study.",0.8661846365008938,0.2652484741959189,0.08911798620384183,0.5735136817276648,0.033809799824675336,0.04044095655408475,0.0800859831561086
Managing Environmental Risk in Presence of Climate Change: The Role of Adaptation in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia,"This study investigates the impact of climate change adaptation on farm households' downside risk exposure in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia. The analysis relies on a moment-based specification of the stochastic production function. We use an empirical strategy that accounts for the heterogeneity in the decision on whether to adapt or not, and for unobservable characteristics of farmers and their farm. We find that past adaptation to climate change (i) reduces current downside risk exposure, and so the risk of crop failure; (ii) would have been more beneficial to the non-adapters if they adapted, in terms of reduction in downside risk exposure; and (iii) is a successful risk management strategy that makes the adapters more resilient to climatic conditions.",0.8155256756080742,0.2665403310392633,0.09257809044816749,0.3368536910462576,0.030317909370734017,0.050844254130015316,0.05639821846884732

Participatory Mapping of Local Disaster Risk Reduction Knowledge: An Example from Switzerland,"This article is based on comparative anthropological fieldwork conducted in the Alpine region of Switzerland on sustainable environmental knowledge about natural hazards related to climate change. It examines ways to complement the normative and technological practices of risk management by using local knowledge to improve the resilience of affected communities against climate-related risks. The study shows how agricultural practices and knowledge may contribute to sustainable behavior towards nature and the environment. It explores how local environmental knowledge, perceptions, and handling strategies of climate-related risks may be integrated within a renewed concept of environmental sustainability. Participatory GIS mapping (PGIS) is the primary research method used. Based on applied visual anthropological methods, PGIS is a cartographical approach that integrates local perceptions and strategies of action drawn from interviews and participant observation. This approach enables improved communication of local knowledge and contributes to interdisciplinary cooperation between different academic fields, such as social anthropology, geography, and civil-engineering in the context of technological risk management. The approach encourages the active participation of local people in the process of sustainable risk management through the integration of cultural meanings and local knowledge about the sustainable management of sensitive natural environments.",0.46161896713017986,0.3818671187049911,0.12209805875755876,0.3646244931652131,0.12230805693484786,0.07231347924681182,0.1533820343186744
"An assessment by subsistence farmers of the risks to food security attributable to climate change in Makwanpur, Nepal","The potential impacts of climate change on the food security of subsistence farmers is a serious concern. This article explores the food security situations of two categories of subsistence farm households, vegetable- and cereal-based farming systems, in the Makwanpur district of Nepal in the context of climate change. Local climate data for the past 30 years were analyzed. Interviews with local farmers and key informants, and focus group discussions were carried out to collect the primary data. Empirical data showed that changes in climate variables for the study period were in line with farmers' perceptions and that farming communities were negatively impacted. Perceived impacts were erratic rainfall, increased frequency of floods and droughts, soil degradation and insect pests, weeds and diseases. Farmers have modified traditional cropping patterns and calendar, changed crop varieties and increased fertilizer and pesticide applications in order to maintain crop yields. They have also sought off-farm employment. However, agricultural productivity in the area is declining and only one third of all households in the area were food secure. Household food insecurity was at mild to moderate levels, but vegetable-based households were more secure than cereal-based ones. At the household level, locally successful adaptive measures, such as rainwater harvesting, mulching, planting date adjustments, off-farm opportunities, including infrastructure and extension support, could increase production and contribute to reversing the impact of increased risk attributed to climate change.",0.99234214617547,0.15473548349988195,0.0462112176663768,0.6730295984027833,0.020098017679765847,0.009392360319802522,0.04187771944522926
Are traditional coping mechanisms effective in managing the risk against extreme events? Evidences from flood-prone region in rural India,"Livelihoods of rural poor in developing countries like India are exposed to risks due to natural disasters like floods. Although these risks are covariate, households are affected in varying degrees due to their location and their relative capacity to cope with them. These in turn are household-specific and are decisive in defining the efficacy of coping mechanisms adopted by households to hedge against the impact of floods. The paper attempts to study the nature of risks faced by households in a major flood-prone region of rural India and examine the effectiveness of coping mechanisms adopted. Findings suggest that (i) floods significantly reduce the consumption of households, (ii) traditional coping mechanisms used to manage the impacts are ineffective in safeguarding the risks to their livelihood and (iii) designing comprehensive coping measures, targeting vulnerable groups and combining informal insurance with safety nets will be useful.",0.6146772254591527,0.29802548877088175,0.09561277373291077,0.6078285768437077,0.06598018343259891,0.09126911774732585,0.24525444402573277
Health coping strategies of the people vulnerable to climate change in a resource-poor rural setting in Bangladesh,"Background: Among the many challenges faced by the people of Bangladesh, the effects of climate change are discernibly threatening, impacting on human settlement, agricultural production, economic development, and human health. Bangladesh is a low-income country with limited resources; its vulnerability to climate change has influenced individuals to seek out health coping strategies. The objectives of the study were to explore the different strategies/measures people employ to cope with climate sensitive diseases and sickness. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 450 households from Rajshahi and Khulna districts of Bangladesh selected through multi-stage sampling techniques, using a semi-structured questionnaire supplemented by 12 focus group discussions and 15 key informant interviews. Results: Respondents applied 22 types of primary health coping strategies to prevent climate related diseases and sickness. To cope with health problems, 80.8% used personal treatment experiences and 99.3% sought any treatments available at village level. The percentage of respondents that visited unqualified health providers to cope with climate induced health problems was quite high, namely 92.7% visited village doctors, 75.9% drug stores, and 67.3% self-medicated. Ninety per cent of the respondents took treatment from unqualified providers as their first choice. Public health facilities were the first choice of treatment for only 11.0% of respondents. On average, every household spent Bangladesh Currency Taka 9,323 per year for the treatment of climate sensitive diseases and sickness. Only 46% of health expenditure was managed from their savings. The rest, 54% expenditure, was supported by using 24 different sources, such as social capital and the selling of family assets. The rate of out-of-pocket payment was almost 100%. Conclusion: People are concerned about climate induced diseases and sickness and sought preventive as well as curative measures to cope with health problems. The most common and widely used climate health coping strategies among the respondents included self-medicating and seeking the health service of unqualified private health care providers. Per family spending to cope with such health problems is expensive and completely based on out of pocket payment. There is no fund pooling, community funding or health insurance program in rural areas to support the health coping of the people. Policies are needed to reduce out-of-pocket payment, to improve the quality of the unqualified providers and to extend public health services at rural areas and support climate related health coping. Collection of such knowledge on climate related health coping strategies can allow researchers to study any specific issue on health coping, and policy makers to initiate effective climate related health coping strategies for climate vulnerable people.",0.27218040338134214,0.5265612449876631,0.07266362282176295,0.4464403508161121,0.02602100234878288,0.13889094755556367,0.03361071253188576
Beyond Threshold Approaches to Extreme Heat: Repositioning Adaptation as Everyday Practice,"One of climate change's most certain impacts is increasingly frequent and extreme heat. Heat management and climate adaptation policies generally utilize temperature and humidity thresholds to identify what constitute extreme conditions. In the workplace, such thresholds can be used to trigger reductions in work intensity and/or duration. In regions that routinely exceed proposed thresholds, however, this approach can be deeply problematic and raises critical questions about how frequently exposed populations already manage and mitigate the effects of extreme heat. Drawing on social practice theories, this paper repositions everyday engagements with extreme heat in terms of practices of work. It finds that bodies absorb and produce heat through practices, challenging the view that extreme heat is an external risk to which bodies are exposed. This theoretical starting point also challenges the utility of threshold-based adaptation strategies by demonstrating how heat is actively coproduced by living, performing bodies in weather. This argument is exemplified through a case study of outdoor, manual workers in Australia's monsoon tropics, where work practices were adapted to reduce thermal load. More specifically, we find that workers weather work and work the weather to enable work to be done in extreme conditions. Our analysis of everyday heat adaptation draws attention to the generative capacities of bodies and unsettles two established separations: 1) that between climatic exposure and sensitivity, calling for a more embodied, experiential, and performed perspective and 2) that between climatic impacts and (mal)adaptation, calling for an understanding of climate adaptation, as located in everyday practices, in the management of bodies in weather.",0.22569113352736328,0.4385199272276077,0.07828330808625385,0.17709191022329088,0.04137813434543257,0.2023042294138294,0.05802661260616108
"Climate change and rural communities in Ghana: Social vulnerability, impacts, adaptations and policy implications","This study assessed social vulnerability level, impacts and adaptation strategies to climate change in rural communities in four ecological zones in Ghana. Primary data were collected through questionnaires and interviews from 196 households in 14 rural communities. Using six demographic, social and economic indicators in assessing social vulnerability to climate change, the Sudan and Guinea Savanna zones were ranked the most vulnerable to climate change with SVI of 0.552 and 0.550, respectively. Social vulnerability factors such as high illiteracy level, heavy dependence on climate sensitive occupation, less diversified sources of income and limited access to climate change information contributed to the high vulnerability level of the zones. Frequently experienced climate change impacts in the four ecological zones were erratic rainfall, reduction in crop yield, prolonged drought and shift in cropping season. Most engaged adaptation strategies included crop diversification, engagement in non-farm secondary jobs, rural-urban migration and increasing farm size. The results highlight the importance of local-level climate change vulnerability assessment and demonstrate the need for local area-specific actions/policies to reducing vulnerability and enhancing adaptation in rural communities. The study approach and findings are useful for policymakers in developing countries in identifying avenues to building local communities' resilience to climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"A framework to investigate drivers of adaptation decisions in marine fishing: Evidence from urban, semi-urban and rural communities","Traditional fishing livelihoods need to adapt to changing fish catch/populations, led by numerous anthropogenic, environmental and climatic stressors. The decision to adapt can be influenced by a variety of socio-economic and perceptual factors. However, adaptation decision-making in fishing communities has rarely been studied. Based on previous literature and focus group discussions with community, this study identifies few prominent adaptation responses inmarine fishing and proposes credible factors driving decisions to adopt them. Further, a household survey is conducted, and the association of these drivers with various adaptation strategies is examined among fisherfolk of Maharashtra (India). This statistical analysis is based on 601 responses collected across three regional fishing groups: urban, semi-urban and rural. Regional segregation is done to understand variability in decision-making among groups which might be having different socio-economic and perceptual attributes. The survey reveals that only few urban fishing households have been able to diversify into other livelihoods. While having economic capital increases the likelihood of adaptation among urban and semi-urban communities, rural fishermen are significantly driven by social capital. Perception of climate change affecting fish catch drives adoption of mechanized boats solely in urban region. But increasing number of extreme events affects decisions of semi-urban and rural fishermen. Further, rising pollution and trade competition is associated with adaptation responses in the urban and semi-urban community. Higher education might help fishermen choose convenient forms of adaptation. Also, cooperative membership and subsidies are critical in adaptation decisions. The framework and insights of the study suggest the importance of acknowledging differential decision-making of individuals and communities, for designing effective adaptation and capacity-building policies.

Limits to Resilience from Livelihood Diversification and Social Capital in Lake Social-Ecological Systems,"Diversity of both social networks and livelihood sources plays a central role in determining the sustainability of natural resource use and resilience of social-ecological systems, not least in resource-dependent economies. Yet the types of social capital and characteristics of diversity are not well understood. Here we examine social capital and livelihood diversification strategies in dynamic lakeshore social-ecological systems in Uganda adapting to climate variability and change. Water and land use data are used to explain lake system variations and lakeshore people's livelihood responses in terms of adaptive cycles and examine how system resilience changes over time in response to climatic and other stresses. Interview and household survey data are used to explain household adaptations to climate variability based on livelihood diversification and social capital and to determine which adaptations were dominant during different stages of adaptive cycles. Results show that households adapt to climate variability using concurrent, spatial, and temporal diversification of livelihoods and by drawing on social capital, but these sources of resilience are not sufficient in all circumstances. The availability of adaptation options varies according to the different stages in the adaptive cycle of the lakeshore's dynamic, coupled human-ecological system; to the degree and nature of the climatic stress; and to differences in household access to assets and adaptation options. This implies a need to maintain multiple sources of resilience for use in times of system collapse or crisis.",0.8420705109496366,0.3593342519088265,0.1585023604622181,0.614705159624886,0.0682421378035023,0.02856660391053836,0.11168289044388176
The role of environmental perceptions in migration decision-making: evidence from both migrants and non-migrants in five developing countries,"Research has demonstrated that, in a variety of settings, environmental factors influence migration. Yet much of the existing work examines objective indicators of environmental conditions as opposed to the environmental perceptions of potential migrants. This paper examines migration decision-making and individual perceptions of different types of environmental change (sudden vs. gradual environmental events) with a focus on five developing countries: Vietnam, Cambodia, Uganda, Nicaragua, and Peru. The survey data include both migrants and non-migrants, with the results suggesting that individual perceptions of long-term (gradual) environmental events, such as droughts, lower the likelihood of internal migration. However, sudden-onset events, such as floods, increase movement. These findings substantially improve our understanding of perceptions as related to internal migration and also suggest that a more differentiated perspective is needed on environmental migration as a form of adaptation.",0.31507870941961535,0.39249705526808015,0.09661703746207377,0.5,0.10751119237866645,0.0437670967829893,0.15199702809410068
Coping measures not enough to avoid loss and damage from drought in the North Bank Region of The Gambia,"In 2011 the North Bank Region of The Gambia experienced its most severe drought in 20 years. This article looks at how this drought affected households in the region, the coping measures they adopted, and residual loss and damage. In this study, 'loss and damage' is defined as adverse effects of climatic stressors that people have not been able to avoid through coping and adaptation (from Warner et al., 2012). Data were collected through a questionnaire survey (N = 373), 60 focus group discussions and six expert interviews. Almost all respondents reported that the 2011 drought had affected their household, particularly through crop failure, livestock losses and high food prices. Most households tried to cope by seeking non-farm income or selling livestock to buy food. Others relied on food aid or social networks. However, for almost two thirds of the households, these measures were not sufficient or had adverse effects.",0.8915778959852028,0.2764433474424052,0.05509760890183035,0.6159556109676062,0.02973587793360052,0.04092573975473349,0.07378594036927921
Inter-city travel behaviour adaptation to extreme weather events,"Increased attention has been paid to travel behaviour in circumstances of extreme weather conditions that are expected with climate change, and the analyses usually address intra-city travel. There is lack of assessments on inter-city travel which has less redundancy and is more exposed to extreme weather threats. In addition, much of the research has been carried out in developed countries. This paper provides new perspectives by investigating how people adapt their inter-city travel behaviour to flooding impacts in Bangladesh. With an orthogonal design of three flooding scenarios, questionnaire data were collected in 14 coastal and inland areas. Results of the statistical analyses identify the significant impacts of flooding on people's inter-city travel and reveal significant differences in attitudes and responses to flooding and extreme weather in coastal compared to inland locations. The main factors significantly affecting travel behaviour choice are road disruption, isolation by flood water, and flood frequency. These factors are felt differently in coastal and inland locations. The most common responses are cancelling trips or changing destinations. It is recommended that when making flooding adaptation decisions, it is important to protect road infrastructure and guarantee accessible routes in coastal areas, while offering more flood adaptation education to the inland people.

Migrating to tackle climate variability and change? Insights from coastal fishing communities in Bangladesh,"There is an on-going debate about climate-induced migration but little empirical evidence. We examine how climate-induced migration has impacted vulnerability and adaptation of a coastal fishing community in Bangladesh. We used household surveys, interviews and focus group discussions to compare fishery dependent households who migrated from Kutubdia Island to mainland with those who stayed behind. Our results suggest that the resettled households are less exposed to floods, sea-level-rise and land erosion than those who stayed behind. They also have more livelihood assets, higher incomes and better access to water supply, health and educational services, technology and markets. In our case study migration has thus been a viable strategy to respond to climate variability and change.",0.3481311015550036,0.40619651748584357,0.11056190212505504,0.4833206472045187,0.19868650796301768,0.10623935526072455,0.1239242129128761

"Weather Shocks, Coping Strategies, and Consumption Dynamics in Rural Ethiopia","Rural households adopt a broad range of strategies to cope with adverse weather shocks. Previous studies have examined the effectiveness of individual coping strategies in mitigating the impact of adverse weather shocks, but no study to date has presented a comprehensive evaluation of alternative coping strategies. We employ household panel data spanning 15 years to estimate the impact of weather shocks on consumption and poverty dynamics in rural Ethiopia, along with the effectiveness of household coping strategies in alleviating the impact of shocks. We find that rainfall increases are positively associated with per adult equivalent consumption, while high temperatures are negatively associated with consumption. In terms of household coping strategies, formal social safety net transfers mitigate the impact of adverse rainfall shocks on consumption and off-farm employment mitigates the impact of high-temperature shocks. Simulations suggest that rainfall shocks and formal social safety net transfers significantly influence household poverty dynamics. By contrast, high-temperature shocks and off-farm employment have less impact on poverty dynamics. The results highlight the need for social protection programs that support existing household coping strategies and that can rapidly respond to weather shocks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Male migrants and women farmers in Gorakhpur: Climate adaptation and changing gender relations,"Research on gender and climate change mostly focuses on the negative impacts on women and children, where men are portrayed as somewhat irresponsible, migrating to the cities and leaving behind helpless women to face multiple adversities. Based on data from the peri-urban Gorakhpur city in Uttar Pradesh, a nuanced approach is argued for instead, distinguishing between adaptation strategies of the landed and landless households, investigating the compulsions and decision-making processes behind male migration, and the coping strategies of the women left behind. Male migration, coupled with the women farming and dealing with markets directly, has changed gender relations in the region. New forms of patriarchy and resistance to the same are emerging even as men face crises of masculinity. © 2018 Economic and Political Weekly.

Community perceptions and responses to climate variability and change in the Himalayas,"Himalayan communities live in marginal environments. They are dependent on ecosystem services and thus highly exposed to climate variability and change. This study aimed to help understand how mountain communities perceive change, how change impacts their livelihoods, and how they respond to change. Forty focus group discussions and 144 in-depth interviews at the household level were conducted in 20 villages in northwest India and across Nepal. Perceptions of change were compared with actual climate records where available. Respondents considered rainfall patterns to be less predictable and had experienced an overall reduction in water availability, severely affecting their harvests. Increased temperatures were also reported, particularly at higher elevations. People responded to the changing conditions with a wide range of coping and adaptation mechanisms. However, many of these mechanisms will not be sustainable in view of the likely magnitude of future climate change, and they are also restricted to social groups with appropriate assets. The poor, lower caste families, women, and other marginalized groups are particularly vulnerable and less able to adapt. Targeted efforts are required to move from coping to adapting and to avoid inequalities between social groups increasing due to the different adaptive capacities.",0.6993219871288583,0.34736063076881657,0.12110948515321471,0.5392390004382326,0.07072129609603323,0.04002982419162943,0.12335542376011394
Future resilience of cultural heritage buildings - how do residents make sense of public authorities' sustainability measures?,"Purpose - This paper aims to analyze climate resilience and adaptation of cultural heritage buildings from the perspectives of both public authorities and residents. From a user-oriented domestication perspective, it investigates what barriers the residents meet when trying to make their homes more sustainable and resilient to climate impacts.& para;& para;Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on a qualitative case study: an apartment building from 1890 in an area with protected heritage buildings in Oslo, Norway. The building is in need of renovation to withstand the impacts of climate strain. Expert interviews with public authorities, and interviews/focus groups with residents in the case study, form the empirical basis of the results.& para;& para;Findings - The findings reveal that the residents find the public authorities' sustainability measures confusing and lack information on what to do. The residents have domesticated an environmentally friendly lifestyle, but they are not very concerned about the cultural heritage status of their building. On the contrary, the protection clause is experienced as a barrier against renovation, and the windows are a special concern.& para;& para;Practical implications - Better cooperation between actors representing public authorities could result in easier access to information and less confusing advices for sustainability in cultural heritage buildings.& para;& para;Originality/value - This paper gives new insights on how information from public authorities is perceived by residents, and thus indicates how policy measures for cultural heritage and sustainability should be communicated to achieve public understanding.",0.23158383747636604,0.3872743590237963,0.11457109660123925,0.27487368055329064,0.0798899832074436,0.4341065157241684,0.20424532960863498
Migration as adaptation strategy to cope with climate change A study of farmers' migration in rural India,"Purpose - This study aims to evaluate the link between climate/weather change and farmer migration in Bihar, India. The influence of cognitive conditions and climate-related stress on farmer migration decisions and the socioeconomic characteristics of migrating and non-migrating farm households are analysed. The focus is the role of migration in access to climate and agricultural extension services and the contribution of migration to enhanced farmer coping capacity. Design/methodology/approach - A primary survey was conducted of farm households in seven districts of Bihar, India. Farmer perceptions of climate change were analysed using the mental map technique. The role of socioeconomic characteristics in farm household migration was evaluated using binary logistic regression, and the influence of migration on access to climate and agricultural extension services and the adaptive capacity of migrating households was investigated using descriptive statistics. Findings - Climate-induced livelihood risk factors are one of the major drivers of farmer's migration. The farmers' perception on climate change influences migration along with the socioeconomic characteristics. There is a significant difference between migrating and non-migrating farm households in the utilization of instructions, knowledge and technology based climate and agriculture extension services. Benefits from receipt of remittance, knowledge and social networks from the host region enhances migrating households' adaptive capacity. Originality/value - This study provides micro-evidence of the contribution of migration to farmer adaptive capacity and access to climate and agricultural extension services, which will benefit analyses of climate-induced migration in other developing countries with higher agricultural dependence. In addition, valuable insights are delivered on policy requirements to reduce farmer vulnerability to climate change.",0.8654392872152129,0.4053648193628815,0.07747067612789627,0.6420628027876456,0.05102720215650748,0.01953919972206086,0.027997631924093488
Migration as an Adaptation Strategy and its Gendered Implications A Case Study From the Upper Indus Basin,"Natural resource-dependent isolated mountain communities are highly vulnerable to climatic and environmental stresses, and migration is often the most important livelihood diversification strategy for insuring a household against shocks. In this paper, we present some key results from a study conducted in the West Karakoram region of Pakistan to assess the influence of environmental shocks on migration and the effect of remittances on the adaptive capacity of recipient households and on gender relations. Primary data were collected at community and household level through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and quantitative questionnaires covering 210 households in 6 villages of the West Karakoram. Our findings suggest that migration is adopted as a core response to environmental pressure, both as an ex ante form of household risk mitigation against decreased and uncertain agricultural production, and as an ex post coping mechanism in the wake of environmental shocks. Gender structures migration; only men participate in circular labor migration to urban areas, while women are left behind to take care of the agricultural work and the household. Despite women's increased role in farming activities, no significant changes were noted in the decision-making power of women as a result of male outmigration. Gender positive transformative processes are more likely to be intergenerational and driven by increased access to education for girls.",0.625173922857696,0.3744194563277417,0.05966841240101608,0.832660013050866,0.08963532933060159,0.022059065679908407,0.05184235804178846

Thermal Adaptation Methods of Urban Plaza Users in Asia's Hot-Humid Regions: A Taiwan Case Study,"Thermal adaptation studies provide researchers great insight to help understand how people respond to thermal discomfort. This research aims to assess outdoor urban plaza conditions in hot and humid regions of Asia by conducting an evaluation of thermal adaptation. We also propose that questionnaire items are appropriate for determining thermal adaptation strategies adopted by urban plaza users. A literature review was conducted and first hand data collected by field observations and interviews used to collect information on thermal adaptation strategies. Item analysisExploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)were applied to refine the questionnaire items and determine the reliability of the questionnaire evaluation procedure. The reliability and validity of items and constructing process were also analyzed. Then, researchers facilitated an evaluation procedure for assessing the thermal adaptation strategies of urban plaza users in hot and humid regions of Asia and formulated a questionnaire survey that was distributed in Taichung's Municipal Plaza in Taiwan. Results showed that most users responded with behavioral adaptation when experiencing thermal discomfort. However, if the thermal discomfort could not be alleviated, they then adopted psychological strategies. In conclusion, the evaluation procedure for assessing thermal adaptation strategies and the questionnaire developed in this study can be applied to future research on thermal adaptation strategies adopted by urban plaza users in hot and humid regions of Asia.",0.4830576118320264,0.3499484930066198,0.09970331699083824,0.38247046132657936,0.05475363442439436,0.2945519678682808,0.08154882601038428
Seasonal drought thresholds and internal migration for adaptation: Lessons from northern Bangladesh,"It is widely accepted that human mobility caused by environmental change will take place internally within the affected countries rather than across borders. This research examines the link between environmental vulnerability and human migration in various socioeconomic contexts. Previous studies have examined population mobility in response to vulnerability driven by sudden natural hazards like cyclone, flood and earthquake. However, little is known about the dynamics of human mobility in response to slow-onset hazards like drought. This study included comprehensive fieldwork with socioeconomically disadvantaged migrants in northern rural areas of Bangladesh who are exposed to seasonal drought. The study focused on a better understanding of how affected individuals and families make decisions to either stay or to migrate internally in response to seasonal drought and other socioeconomic vulnerabilities. By adopting a case study approach, rural-to- urban migrants and their family members in the northern highland area of the country, known as the Barind Tract, were interviewed. The results suggest that migration decisions are consolidated by a variety of stressors including both environmental and nonenvironmental components. The research found that some interventions implemented by the government and nongovernment organisations are posing long-lasting impacts on the sustainability of rural livelihood with a propensity to increase, not reduce, outward migration. These interventions have been questions and recommendations are made to address this emerging and complex livelihood problem. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",0.4021864704853499,0.5137486890988713,0.07682855941511756,0.5126481137888098,0.17380433984195667,0.06896128959401165,0.096115919642382
"Urban adaptation to climate sensitive health effect: Evaluation of coping strategies for dengue in Delhi, India","In absence of adaptation initiative, residents resort to coping strategies to manage climate-related health risks. Delhi, the capital city of India, is highly endemic to the climate sensitive vector-borne disease of dengue. The weeks of a year with risk of dengue occurrence due to weather patterns are identified by using Poisson regression which uses data for climate variables and reported dengue cases. The coping strategies adopted by household are then evaluated using survey data of 559 households. An economic evaluation of coping strategies to serve as an important decision tool in developing adaptive capacity was carried out using household health production function approach. The econometric tools of Negative Binomial Regression and probit regression have been used for evaluation. The methodological framework provides a novel approach by linking climatic variability, health impact and economic evaluation of adaptation strategies. The results reveal that the dengue risk is mainly addressed by coping strategies at the household level and intervention measures are ineffective due to inappropriate timing and selective approach. The annual economic benefit of adopting coping strategies is estimated as US$ 65 per household. The benefits of coping strategies in reducing dengue risk contribute to the planning of adaptation strategies at city level.",0.3737838217711117,0.2882749700841216,0.07816209050183981,0.6683785123731071,0.037803794368595614,0.15719950608740343,0.07087305239103409
"Weather Shocks, Agricultural Production and Migration: Evidence from Tanzania","We analyse whether Tanzanian rural households engage in internal migration as a response to weather-related shocks. We hypothesise that, when exposed to such shocks and a consecutive crop yield reduction, rural households use migration as a risk management strategy. Our findings confirm that for an average household, a 1 per cent reduction in agricultural income induced by weather shock increases the probability of migration by 13 percentage points on average within the following year. However, this effect is significant only for households in the middle of wealth distribution, suggesting that the choice of migration as an adaptation strategy depends on initial endowment. What is more, the proposed mechanism applies to households whose income is highly dependent on agriculture, but is not important for diversified livelihoods.",0.5837490143983637,0.2964090628410055,0.05951094786442616,0.7050264546706072,0.04516656313528313,0.0377024877348448,0.057807036618513254
How small communities respond to environmental change: patterns from tropical to polar ecosystems,"Local communities throughout the world are experiencing extensive social, cultural, economic, environmental, and climatic changes. Rather than passively accepting the effects of such changes, many communities are responding in various ways to take advantage of opportunities and to minimize negative impacts. We review examples from 13 cases around the world to identify patterns in how communities have been able to respond to change. Communities are able to respond by making changes in the time and location of activities, by using different species, by developing or using new technologies, and by organizing themselves internally or in networks. The possible responses a community can make on its own constitute the autonomous response space. When communities work with others to respond, they are in the collaborative response space. These findings suggest that assessments concerning climate and other forms of change should include local responses as a foundation for policy recommendations, recognizing that both autonomous and collaborative responses can contribute to adaptation. Policies designed to achieve adaptation or sustainability should consider ways to expand the autonomous response space, thus freeing local initiative, while also making the collaborative response space more cooperative, thus providing support to communities rather than imposing limitations.",0.38354670253976725,0.4251446732555354,0.13538412109465722,0.4316401775438297,0.130910652620868,0.08050275164179835,0.13045007965899386
Factors of subjective heat stress of urban citizens in contexts of everyday life,"Heat waves and the consequent heat stress of urban populations have a growing relevance in urban risk management and strategies of urban adaptation to climate change. In this context, social science studies on subjective experiencing of heat as stress by urban citizens are a new emerging field. To contribute to the understanding of self-reported subjective heat stress and its major determinants in a daily life perspective, we conducted a questionnaire survey with 323 respondents in Karlsruhe, Germany, after heat waves in July and August 2013. Statistical data analysis showed that subjective heat stress is an issue permeating everyday activities. Subjective heat stress at home was lower than at work and in general. Subjective heat stress in general, at home, and at work was determined by the health impairments experienced during the heat and the feeling of being helplessly exposed to the heat. For subjective heat stress at home, characteristics of the residential building and the built environment additionally played a role. Although the rate of implemented coping measures was rather high, coping measures showed no uniform effect for the subjective heat stress. We conclude that in terms of urban adaptation strategies, further research is needed to understand how various processes of daily social (work) life enable or limit individual coping and that communication strategies are important for building capacities to better cope with future heat waves.",0.09606120386111718,0.5778271274089959,0.06767602653511617,0.20052468825784908,0.03573680108357447,0.3904184769282712,0.04003066749718886
Climatic and environmental change in the Karakoram: making sense of community perceptions and adaptation strategies,"In this paper, we investigate how mountain communities perceive and adapt to climatic and environmental change. Primary data were collected at community and household level through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and quantitative questionnaires covering 210 households in six villages of the West Karakoram (Hundur and Darkut in the Yasin Valley; Hussainabad, Altit, Gulmit, and Shiskat in the Hunza valley of Gilgit-Baltistan). The relevance of the area with respect to our scopes is manifold. First, this is one of the most extreme and remote mountainous areas of the world, characterized by complex and fragile institutional and social fabrics. Second, this region is one of the focal points of research for the hydro-meteo-climatological scientific community, because of its relevance in terms of storage and variability of water resources for the whole Indus basin, and for the presence of conflicting signals of climate change with respect to the neighboring regions. Third, the extreme hardships due to a changing environment, as well as to the volatility of the social and economic conditions are putting great stress on the local population. As isolating climate change as a single driver is often not possible, community perceptions of change are analyzed in the livelihood context and confronted with multi-drivers scenarios affecting the lives of mountain people. We compare the collected perceptions with the available hydro-climatological data, trying to answer some key questions such as: how are communities perceiving, coping with, and adapting to climatic and environmental change? Which are the most resorted adaptation strategies? How is their perception of change influencing the decision to undertake certain adaptive measures?.",0.5650021896418922,0.3363098140370315,0.16825753804857635,0.48318572796372866,0.0475184345358003,0.047709310170690716,0.15747531570396242
How Can Urban Policies Improve Air Quality and Help Mitigate Global Climate Change: a Systematic Mapping Review,"Tackling climate change at the global level is central to a growing field of scientific research on topics such as environmental health, disease burden, and its resulting economic impacts. At the local level, cities constitute an important hub of atmospheric pollution due to the large amount of pollutants that they emit. As the world population shifts to urban centers, cities will increasingly concentrate more exposed populations. Yet, there is still significant progress to be made in understanding the contribution of urban pollutants other than CO2, such as vehicle emissions, to global climate change. It is therefore particularly important to study how local governments are managing urban air pollution. This paper presents an overview of local air pollution control policies and programs that aim to reduce air pollution levels in megacities. It also presents evidence measuring their efficacy. The paper argues that local air pollution policies are not only beneficial for cities but are also important for mitigating and adapting to global climate change. The results systematize several policy approaches used around the world and suggest the need for more in-depth cross-city studies with the potential to highlight best practices both locally and globally. Finally, it calls for the inclusion of a more human rights-based approach as a mean of guaranteeing of clean air for all and reducing factors that exacerbate climate change.",0.1413353884309426,0.41435748861294663,0.09502800475490883,0.23384779942911688,0.044044649238441015,0.48395551075176657,0.15268087807030967
Rainfall Patterns and US Migration from Rural Mexico,"In many rural regions of developing countries, natural resource dependency means changes in climate patterns hold tremendous potential to impact livelihoods. When environmentally-based livelihood options are constrained, migration can become an important adaptive strategy. Using data from the Mexican Migration Project, we model U.S. emigration from rural communities as related to community, household and climate factors. The results suggest that households subjected to very recent drought conditions are less likely to send a U.S. migrant, but in communities with drought two years prior and with strong migration histories, emigration is much more likely. In regions lacking such social networks, rainfall deficits actually reduce migration propensities, perhaps reflecting constraints in the ability to engage in migration as a coping strategy. Policy implications emphasize diversification of rural Mexican livelihoods in the face of contemporary climate change.",0.6542190638368804,0.4602078189025795,0.08252421202905617,0.6915967339617985,0.05998860813763674,0.02849893276656315,0.06442486620114982
Adapting to climate change: Reflections of peasant farmers in Mashonaland West Province of Zimbabwe,"Climate change is projected to have negative impacts on agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa and this is likely to continue for decades, unless adaptation measures are implemented. The changing climate is a global challenge to sustainable livelihoods and economic development. Peasant farmers in Zimbabwe depend entirely on rain-fed agriculture, a situation that makes agriculture and rural livelihoods vulnerable to climate change. This paper discusses the findings of the study carried out in the Zvimba District amongst peasant farmers on their knowledge of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies. Semi-structured interviews, observations and document analysis were used as methodologies for data collection for the study. Purposeful sampling technique was applied to 40 peasant farmers. Qualitative data from interviews and focus group discussion were analysed using context analysis. Households acknowledged that rainfall amount has decreased over the last 30 years. Such changes have reduced agricultural productivity, and in response, communities have developed multiple adaptation strategies such as harnessing social capital, crop and livelihood diversification, engaging in small businesses and water harvesting for livestock keeping. The study concludes that there is a need to recognise the validity of indigenous knowledge and an inventory should be created for future use. The paper notes that diversification of adaptive strategies is vital for sustainable livelihood in a changing climate.",0.9784073271749207,0.2713738873802671,0.1033090429268367,0.6692423100604722,0.034994209633049445,0.015343817728758808,0.039546097103116996
Use of traditional medicines to cope with climate-sensitive diseases in a resource poor setting in Bangladesh,"Background: This study aims to explore the use of traditional medicines to cope with climate sensitive diseases in areas vulnerable to climate change. We assessed the extent to which traditional or alternative medicines were used for the treatment of the climate sensitive diseases by villagers as part of their health-coping strategies. Methods: The study deployed a mixed-method research design to know the health-coping strategies of the people in a resource-poor setting. A cross sectional study was conducted from September 2010 to March 2011 among 450 households selected randomly in the districts of Rajshahi and Khulna, Bangladesh. The elder males or females of each household were interviewed. For qualitative methods, twelve focus group discussions (six with females and six with males) and fifteen key informant interviews were conducted by the research team, using interview guidelines on the use of traditional medicine. Results: Univariate analysis showed that the use of traditional medicines has increased among community members of all socio-economic and demographic backgrounds. Due to the increased incidence of disease and sickness respondents had to increase the use of their cultural means to cope with adverse health situations. Conclusions: A systematic collection of knowledge on the use of traditional medicines to cope with climate-sensitive diseases can help the adaptation of communities vulnerable to climate change. In addition it can be instrumental in creating a directory of traditional medicine components used for specific diseases and highlight the effectiveness and relevance of traditional medicines as health-coping strategies. This may be useful for policymakers, researchers, and development partners to adapt existing health care policy in resource-limited contexts. It may also encourage WHO, national and international institutions, such as pharmaceutical companies, to carry out research investigating the effectiveness of these traditional medicines and integrate them with modern medicine. Overall, it could increase the health coping capacity of people in a resource-poor setting and contribute to their adaptation capabilities.",0.5637913223061446,0.44518040796474184,0.07525570863596469,0.4487471920535128,0.08427848587879773,0.09399787492402914,0.05670651265151677
Climate change perception and choice of adaptation strategies Empirical evidence from smallholder farmers in east Ethiopia,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze smallholder farmers' perceptions of climate change and its adverse effects, identify major adaptation strategies used by farmers and analyze the factors that influence the choice of adaptation strategy by smallholder farmers in eastern Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach - The study was based on a cross-sectional survey of 296 sample households selected from three districts in east Ethiopia. Data were collected with the aid of a semi-structured questionnaire and review of literature, documents and databases. Findings - The study provides empirical evidence that majority of farmers in the study area are aware of climate change patterns and their adverse effect on income, food security, diversity, forest resources, food prices and crop and livestock diseases. In response to these adverse effects, major adaptation strategies used by farmers include cultivating different crops, planting different crop varieties, changing planting dates, use of soil and water conservation techniques, conservation agriculture practices and engaging in non-farm income activities. Choice of adaptation strategies are influenced by gender of household head, household size, farm size, distance from market and number of farm plots. Practical implications - The study suggests that developing more effective climate change adaptation strategies need support from the government. Such an effort needs provision of the necessary resources such as credit, information and extension services on climate change adaptation strategies and technologies, and investing in climate smart and resilient projects. Originality/value - The study adopts multivariate probit model that models farmers' simultaneous adaptation choice behavior which has been rarely addressed by previous researches.",0.9923920080806461,0.14892695347636165,0.07520257651232076,0.6876929902399752,0.021338229695128164,0.009527502075058841,0.013178288423132557
"Condemned to live with one's feet in water? A case study of community based strategies and urban maladaptation in flood prone Pikine/Dakar, Senegal","Purpose - The number of poor and informal urban settlers in the world is rapidly growing, and they are increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of a changing climate. Therefore, understanding the nature and sustainability of locally adopted coping and adaptation strategies are key, yet still under-researched areas. Design/methodology/approach - Based on ethnographic research conducted in two poor, flood-prone municipalities in Pikine/Dakar, this paper identifies such coping and adaptation strategies and examines their prospects for maladaptation. Findings - The paper shows that poor urban dwellers are not mere passive spectators of climate change. With the very limited resources they have at their disposal, it is found that local actors respond to perennial flooding with very diverse strategies, which have varying degrees of success and sustainability. A key finding is that local coping and adaptation strategies are mainly maladaptive because they divert risks and impacts in time and space and have detrimental effects on the most vulnerable. Unless there is a broad assimilation of all groups in decision-making processes locally, individual and even collective coping and adaptation strategies may easily put the most vulnerable households at greater risk. The findings reveal that community-based adaptation is not a panacea per se, as it may not, by itself, compensate for the lack of basic services and infrastructure that is forcing the urban poor to cope with disproportionate levels of risk. Originality/value - The paper, hence, contributes to address a central question in scholarly debates on climate adaptation, vulnerability and disaster risk management: Are local coping strategies a stepping stone towards adaptation or are they on the contrary likely to lead to maladaptation?",0.26930005222996567,0.3543158336486324,0.07623496110985604,0.5360503535120361,0.09378759749549065,0.4239655562374824,0.18243540424293916
Farmers' Options to Address Water Scarcity in a Changing Climate: Case Studies from two Basins in Mediterranean Chile,"Irrigated agriculture in Mediterranean areas faces tremendous challenges because of its exposure to hydroclimatic variability, increasing competition for water from different sectors, and the possibility of a climatic change. In this context, efficient management of water resources emerges as a critical issue. This requires the adoption of technological innovations, investment in infrastructure, adequate institutional arrangements, and informed decision makers. To understand farmers' perceptions and their implementation of climate change adaptation strategies with regards to water management, primary information was captured in the Limari and Maule river basins in Chile. Farmers identified stressors for agriculture; climate change, droughts, and lack of water appeared as the most relevant stressors compared to others productive, economic, and institutional factors; revealing a rising relevance of climate related factors. While most producers perceived climate changes in recent years (92.9 %), a significant proportion (61.1 %) claim to have experienced drought, whereas only a fraction (31.9 %) have implemented a strategy to deal with this situation. Identified actions were classified in four groups: investments for water accumulation, modernization of irrigation systems, rationalization of water use, and partnership activities. Using a multinomial logit model these strategies were related to socioeconomic and productive characteristics. Results show that gender and farm size are relevant for investments, implementation and improvement of irrigation systems. For all the strategies described, access to weather information was a relevant element. The study provides empirical evidence of a recent increase in the importance assigned to climate factors by producers and adaptation options that can be supported by agricultural policy.",0.8712105079565231,0.16776980367192493,0.14190240252782524,0.25970577649334803,0.03759056647457775,0.05267547834397491,0.47775914576706907
Using Government Resettlement Projects as a Sustainable Adaptation Strategy for Climate Change,"Given that increasing migration has been addressed as a major consequence of climate change, a growing number of scholars suggest that the planned relocation of people or Government Resettlement Projects (GRPs) should be included in climate change adaptation. This paper reviews the status of climate change and environmentally induced migration in China, and then presents an empirical case study in Shangnan County in northwest China, where a specific GRP called the Massive Southern Shaanxi Migration Program' (MSSMP) has been initiated in response to climate change-related impacts. The results showed that the MSSMP helped local residents to adapt better climate change by reducing exposures to risk, enabling mobility, providing financial incentives, raising living standards, and improving emotional status. Furthermore, the MSSMP added additional benefits for migrants compared with traditional GRPs by respecting voluntary participation, preparing for future risks, and reducing social isolation via a short relocation distance. However, GRPs could also be seen as a maladaptation to climate change because they disproportionately increase the burden on the most vulnerable community members, such as those who are financially disadvantaged, new migrants, and people who are left behind. The paper further suggests that the GRPs should be designed by involving multiple adaptation strategies as supplements for GRPs, and broadening the political schemes to consider the special needs of vulnerable groups. This study contributes to an understanding of the roles of GRPs in sustainable climate change adaptation, thereby facilitating the design, organization, and implication of future similar programs.",0.31551541097680497,0.39743570453995736,0.07776389829126502,0.3650024255491698,0.06399717473187899,0.17676428293144167,0.08316384877569857

"Rainfall variability, food security and human mobility in the Janjgir-Champa district of Chhattisgarh state, India","The impacts of rainfall variability are threatening food production systems, leading to losses of livelihood and food insecurity. The frequency and intensity of floods and drought are likely to be higher as a result of climate change. This case study presents an empirical account of the impacts of rainfall variability on agriculture, food security, livelihoods and human mobility in the Janjigir-Champa district of Chhattisgarh. The research tests the hypothesis that human migration is a major coping mechanism against climate variability. The findings confirm that a coordination mechanism exists between rainfall changes (i.e. erratic rainfall patterns in terms of delayed monsoons, seasonal shifts, drought and floods) and livelihood and food security of a number of farmers and farm labourers in the research site. Because there is only a single annual harvest of paddy rice (practiced as monoculture) in the research site, which is partly due to the non-availability of water for a second crop, marginal farmers and farm labourers are left with very few options in finding sufficient employment in and around their villages. Some people cope with the situation by seeking assistance from their relatives, friends and the government. However, seasonal and permanent migrations are the most opted-for coping strategies in the study area.",0.933968913164677,0.2119144460138174,0.07360847441492198,0.6772911675061707,0.028846972939178706,0.013413465929580787,0.0741465571601372
The role of ad hoc networks in supporting climate change adaptation: a case study from the Southeastern United States,"To examine the factors that support adaptation within a regional and sectoral context, this article explores five climate-sensitive sectors in North and South Carolina (Forestry, Government Administration, Tourism, Water Management, and Wildlife Management) and the role of partnerships, collaborations, and networks in facilitating climate adaptation and related activities. Drawing from 117 online questionnaires and interviews with sector leaders across the Carolinas, the article highlights several key functions of networks in regard to supporting adaptation-intra-sector information sharing; monitoring, data collection, and research; and education and outreach. Furthermore, the analysis examines how climate networks in the region have facilitated the development of bonding, bridging, and linking social capital while also noting factors that have constrained the growth and success of both intra- and cross-sector collaboration. Although no formal, or discrete, state or regional cross-sector climate change network exists in the Carolinas, climate adaptations and capacity-building efforts have been supported by ad hoc and decentralized networks, emerging collegial partnerships within and across sectors, and collaborative efforts to pool expertise and resources. The role of different forms of social capital within these networks is discussed in the context of a contentious political environment where support for activities designed to address climate change is limited. These findings enhance our understanding of the social factors and relational processes that shape and influence capacity to adapt to climate change.",0.1845352043621466,0.5244538288198649,0.20038774982593796,0.3092049071214593,0.2186364255755045,0.1570765870723436,0.1725948681352836
"Linking agricultural adaptation strategies, food security and vulnerability: evidence from West Africa","Adaptation strategies to reduce smallholder farmers' vulnerability to climate variability and seasonality are needed given the frequency of extreme weather events predicted to increase during the next decades in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in West Africa. We explored the linkages between selected agricultural adaptation strategies (crop diversity, soil and water conservation, trees on farm, small ruminants, improved crop varieties, fertilizers), food security, farm household characteristics and farm productivity in three contrasting agro-ecological sites in West Africa (Burkina Faso, Ghana and Senegal). Differences in land area per capita and land productivity largely explained the variation in food security across sites. Based on land size and market orientation, four household types were distinguished (subsistence, diversified, extensive, intensified), with contrasting levels of food security and agricultural adaptation strategies. Income increased steadily with land size, and both income and land productivity increased with degree of market orientation. The adoption of agricultural adaptation strategies was widespread, although the intensity of practice varied across household types. Adaptation strategies improve the food security status of some households, but not all. Some strategies had a significant positive impact on land productivity, while others reduced vulnerability resulting in a more stable cash flow throughout the year. Our results show that for different household types, different adaptation strategies may be 'climate-smart'. The typology developed in this study gives a good entry point to analyse which practices should be targeted to which type of smallholder farmers, and quantifies the effect of adaptation options on household food security. Subsequently, it will be crucial to empower farmers to access, test and modify these adaptation options, if they were to achieve higher levels of food security.",0.9878742926536052,0.16598003964338282,0.07062178508625959,0.6987114197083215,0.017200509510061832,0.012602457469767549,0.010234299770869822
Learning from our older people: Pilot study findings on responding to heat,"AimsWith the advent of climate change, it is important that strategies be put in place to minimise the effects of heat. These impacts can be compounded by other factors such as location and age. This exploratory pilot study focuses on older people in a rural Victorian community that regularly experiences hot weather. MethodMixed methods - including a focus group, household interviews, daily diaries and collection of meteorological data. ResultsThe community is generally well adapted to heat with all having modified their homes and behaviours to cope with extreme heat. There was, however, little understanding or planning regarding the potential health impacts of heat. ConclusionsThere is a clear need for community-directed adaptation to best meet the needs of older people, particularly those living in urban areas, and for targeted public health campaigns to increase awareness of heat-health risks and disseminate the strategies identified in this community.",0.11943916578664206,0.6251717522253529,0.08589694561026356,0.20916641245378698,0.031215359001141894,0.2599907481142062,0.0325689499052382
Women and Climate Stress: Role Reversal from Beneficiaries to Expert Participants,"Women, especially in the marginalized communities of the high-risk regions prone to flood and drought are considered most vulnerable to climate change risks. They play a very important role in household nutrition management and resource management in terms of labor, off-farm products, and small savings. In the absence of help from formal and informal R and D and technology institutions, their knowledge and resources' exchange system has to be very robust to cope with the seasonal shortages arising due to climate fluctuations. The study found that these exchanges, spilling over caste or class boundaries, serve as valuable informal safety nets and contribute to household resilience. Researchers seeking to strengthen community coping strategies should pursue such polices and institutional interventions which strengthen women's resource exchange and exploitation mechanisms. We offer in the end a 4-E model involving exchange, expertise, ethics, and environmental consciousness which describes how these empower women and help in articulation of their unique coping strength at intra- and inert community levels. Lateral learning among community members sustains and enhances over time collective and household coping strategies with climate risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The contribution of assets to adaptation to extreme temperatures among older adults,"Background Climate change and extreme temperatures pose increasing challenges to individuals and their health with older adults being one of the most vulnerable groups. The aim of this paper is to better understand the roles that tangible assets (e.g., physical or financial) and intangible assets (e.g., human or social) play in the way older adults adapt to extreme temperatures, the types of adaptive responses they implement, limits and constraints, as well opportunities for better adaptation. Rather than focusing exclusively on extremes of heat, or considering each type of asset in isolation, the important and novel contribution of this paper is to take an integrated and multi-seasonal qualitative and quantitative approach, that conjointly investigates all categories of assets in relation to the adaptations that independently-living older adults make to both extreme heat and extreme cold. Methods and findings The paper examines the contribution of assets to adaptation to extreme temperatures among older adults living independently in their homes. An innovative mixed methods study with an inter-seasonal approach was implemented in Lisbon, Portugal with interviews and surveys during summer for extreme heat and winter for extreme cold. The ability of participants to adapt to extreme temperatures was found to be dependent on asset context and diversity, and the dynamics through which extreme temperatures enhanced or reduced the stock of assets available. As a result, participants engaged in activities of assets replacement, exchange or substitutions. Despite this, many participants recognised many constraints and limits to their ability to adapt and protect their health and well-being ranging from reduced income, high energy costs and lack of social networks. Opportunities for improving older adults' adaptation were found to exist and strategies, action and investment have been identified by older adults which included life-long education, incentives to improve insulation and local activities. Conclusions The paper suggests that the implementation of the proposed asset-based approach linking assets and adaptation to extreme temperatures, illustrates the key pathway that individuals, their families and carers, governments, policymakers, researchers and practitioners can follow to ensure effective adaptation and promote health and well-being. Supporting older adults' adaptation to extreme temperatures is possible and can be complemented with efforts to reduce older adults' vulnerability and building resilience to extreme temperatures. These findings pose concrete implications for policy and practice, including for example the need for implementation of measures and actions to reduce poverty, reduce energy costs, improve the quality of the housing stock and improve older adults' social networks.",0.17237176437360605,0.5156500217435467,0.08912020797918231,0.2896736273493091,0.06779432742818432,0.18584445522745993,0.039448120054706506
Impacts of decline harvest of country food on nutrient intake among Inuit in Arctic Canada: impact of climate change and possible adaptation plan,"Background. The pervasive food insecurity and the diet transition away from local, nutrient-rich country foods present a public health challenge among Inuit living in the Canadian Arctic. While environmental factors such as climate change decreased the accessibility and availability of many country food species, new species were introduced into regions where they were previously unavailable. An adaptation such as turning to alternate country food species can be a viable solution to substitute for the nutrients provided by the declined food species. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact on nutrient intake using hypothetical scenarios that current commonly harvested country foods were reduced by 50%, and were replaced with alternate or new species. Methods. Data collected during the 2007 - 2008 Inuit Health Survey from 36 Canadian Arctic communities spanning Nunavut, the Inuvialuit Settlement Region and Nunatsiavut were used. Results. A 50% decline in consumption of fish, whale, ringed seals and birds ( the food that was reported to be in decline) resulted in a significant decrease in essential nutrient intake. Possible substitute foods were identified but some nutrients such as zinc and especially vitamin D were most often found lacking in the alternative diet. Conclusions. If the alternative species are not available or feasible, more expensive and less nutritionally dense store-bought foods may be sought. Given the superior quality of country foods and their association with food security, and Inuit cultural health and personal identity, developing skills and awareness for adaptation, promoting regional sharing networks, forming a co-management agency and continuing nutritional monitoring may potentially preserve the nutritional integrity of Inuit diet, and in turn their health and cultural survival.",0.615875223225365,0.3973545745274554,0.1025184284061057,0.3756129581623053,0.06054357781552753,0.04945718019745807,0.030917978822522167
Transformation of rural communities: lessons from a local self-initiative for building resilience in the Solomon Islands,"Solomon Islands is vulnerable to negative impacts from climate change, where people's livelihoods and their well-being are threatened, especially the viability of isolated communities. Realising the increasing risks from climate change on communities, government, in partnership with aid-donor partners, has invested millions of dollars in climate change projects, through mitigation and adaptation strategies. As a form of adaptation, the government invests in programmes aimed at increasing the adaptive capacity of the vulnerable communities through landscape and seascape projects across the rural communities. Focusing on the ""transformation concept"" as a long-term adaptation strategy and enlargement of climate engineering and ecological resilience concepts, the paper discusses why building resilience from transformation of rural communities, as well as from landscape and seascape projects, would benefit communities and relevant authorities. This paper describes the findings of a study on two rural villages, Keigold and Mondo, from Ranogha Islands, Western Province, in Solomon Islands, where 80% of households decided to relocate from their old village ""Mondo"" to their new home ""Keigold"" after an earthquake in 2007, as part of a self-initiative. The reallocation process can be seen as a case of pro-active community transformation that provides valuable lessons to other rural communities that may be forced to move due to impacts from natural catastrophes, including those explained by climate change risks. Lessons from this experience suggest that policy-makers and non-government organisations should consider and empower local transformation initiatives as a way to building long-term adaptation to climate change.",0.470214621417674,0.44346087207037793,0.10277330563200385,0.5104828554624115,0.0858817012849601,0.09057945357057484,0.20327275931782043
"Comparing perceived effects of climate-related environmental change and adaptation strategies for the Pacific small island states of Tuvalu, Samoa, and Tonga","Inhabitants of Pacific small island states are facing multiple socio-ecological pressures, with climate change being one of the most prominent. Nevertheless, the agency of local stakeholders in decisions on how to adapt to climate-related environmental change has been largely underappreciated in the climate change sciences as well as in policy decisions. We, therefore, conducted a survey study in Tuvalu, Samoa, and Tonga, asking specifically how residents perceive their situation regarding climate-related challenges, what adaptation strategies they have devised and implemented, and what they expect of governmental and nongovernmental organisations in these efforts. In contrast to the common perception that Pacific small island states are primarily threatened by rising sea levels, residents' perceptions indicate that drought, cyclones and other flood-related problems pose a far more imminent danger. Our results suggest that further research on those perceived environmental changes is advisable to provide reliable data for scientific models and policy decisions.",0.2778022904345038,0.41532732115480014,0.10673127426782857,0.2911933213509635,0.22890468051407142,0.11382606631470221,0.14638066179548226
"Adapting to the Changing Climate: An Assessment of Local Health Department Preparations for Climate Change-Related Health Threats, 2008-2012","Background Climate change poses a major public health threat. A survey of U.S. local health department directors in 2008 found widespread recognition of the threat, but limited adaptive capacity, due to perceived lack of expertise and other resources. Methods We assessed changes between 2008 and 2012 in local public health departments' preparedness for the public health threats of climate change, in light of increasing national polarization on the issue, and widespread funding cutbacks for public health. A geographically representative online survey of directors of local public health departments was conducted in 2011-2012 (N = 174; response rate = 50%), and compared to the 2008 telephone survey results (N = 133; response rate = 61%). Results Significant polarization had occurred: more respondents in 2012 were certain that the threat of local climate change impacts does/does not exist, and fewer were unsure. Roughly 10% said it is not a threat, compared to 1% in 2008. Adaptation capacity decreased in several areas: perceived departmental expertise in climate change risk assessment; departmental prioritization of adaptation; and the number of adaptation-related programs and services departments provided. In 2008, directors' perceptions of local impacts predicted the number of adaptation-related programs and services their departments offered, but in 2012, funding predicted programming and directors' impact perceptions did not. This suggests that budgets were constraining directors' ability to respond to local climate change-related health threats. Results also suggest that departmental expertise may mitigate funding constraints. Strategies for overcoming these obstacles to local public health departments' preparations for climate change are discussed.",0.2881750516769634,0.5172810833620761,0.08815047764780286,0.18358725540901305,0.049950222981075425,0.12879505714151193,0.06771518301633996
Mapping the pastoral migratory patterns under land appropriation in East Sudan: the case of the Lahaween Ethnic Group,"The loss of about 4 million ha of land in East Sudan to mechanised rain-fed agriculture severely restricts pastoral mobility, as much of this land is the traditional rangeland for different transhumant pastoralists and smallholder farmers in the area. The aim of this paper is to map the current transformations of the migration patterns of transhumant pastoralists in East Sudan as a result of the land appropriation, by taking the Lahaween ethic group as an example. The paper followed a mixed approach of mapping, geo-coded field trips using GPS device, focus group discussion and key informant interviews. The findings showed that the annual movement of the Lahaween covers approximately 350 km. They spend 77% of their annual cycle in the summer areas. Frequent and rapid herd movement is a principal strategy in the process of coping with land appropriation. Other coping and adaptation mechanisms taken by the Lahaween included separation of animal types; separation of herds from households; fragmentation of households; use of vehicles and mobile phones in managing herds; entering the national game park; and crossing the international border. The need to promote and facilitate livestock mobility is a longstanding claim in the region. However, the continued neglect of livestock movement territories by state planners is a contested issue which might add a new dilemma of conflict to the country. The mapping exercise presented in this paper is expected to offer a technical guide for solving the problem of congested mobility. It also provides decision-makers with the current territories of pastoralists' movements.",0.727793675873302,0.3199606577626773,0.11028376453672185,0.5506694951020035,0.03273503614306314,0.039505848157937895,0.044679337487365536
"Autonomous adaptation to riverine flooding in Satkhira District, Bangladesh: implications for adaptation planning","Systematic understanding of adaptation measures utilised by households in developing countries is needed to identify the constraints they face, and the external interventions or adaptation planning needed to overcome them. Understanding of autonomous household adaptation patterns remains underdeveloped. In particular, little is known regarding whether households are implementing incremental or transformational adaptation measures as well as the implications of this for adaptation planning. We demonstrate the suitability of the risk hazard approach for understanding autonomous household adaptation patterns and discuss the implications for planned adaptation. To achieve this, we use an in-depth village case study from an area of Bangladesh particularly vulnerable to climate change, using qualitative semi-structured household interviews as primary material. We find that the risk hazard approach is ideal for exploring autonomous adaptations because of its capacity for understanding how households respond to livelihood risk, and what resources are required for it to be most effective. However, the risk hazard approach overlooks equity and fairness considerations need to be integrated due to the insufficient emphasis on these concerns.",0.3076798560231154,0.37872303172284044,0.13219567000892682,0.3750175445016331,0.10217145505798167,0.1571290233009868,0.15139000174119155
Arctic Tourism and Sustainable Adaptation: Community Perspectives to Vulnerability and Climate Change,"The role of tourism in local development, combined with globalisation and climate change, are generating both opportunities and threats across Arctic communities. The impacts of climate change are felt more intensely in communities that are dependent on natural resources. This is increasingly occurring through Arctic tourism, which is often based on nature, and is the foundation of the economy of many small Arctic communities. The interplay between tourism and community-based adaptation represents a significant focus in Arctic tourism studies and can bring invaluable information to governments about the local level climate change impacts on livelihoods and on the potential future challenges. The results from a vulnerability study conducted in two case study communities in Finnish Lapland indicate that both external and internal stresses, combined with the impacts of climate change, force the communities to reconsider their current development paths. The communities are still able to absorb the changes taking place in weather patterns, but the current development paths do not fully support the idea of sustainable adaptation, with its concepts of environmental integrity, social justice and participation. Though several adaptation strategies are deployed, future vulnerability may increase due to ineffective adaptation mechanisms and the increasing role of nature in tourism development.",0.24270183488920408,0.5132302397500569,0.14991447500824548,0.3997220294559293,0.26038403592048454,0.06064774452999992,0.07151136946215328
Farmers' perceptions of and responses to environmental change in southwest coastal Bangladesh,"Coastal Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to climate change and salinisation; hence, farm-level adaptation is critically important. Farmers' perceptions of and responses to environmental change were investigated in two villages in Khulna District. Perceived environmental trends included increases in temperature, extreme weather events, soil toxicity, erratic rainfall and scarcity of water for irrigation. Perceptions of climate trends were consistent with measured trends in Khulna. On-farm adaptation strategies included adjusting planting dates, excavating trenches in rice-fields, adopting new crops, salinity-reducing technologies, livestock-rearing and home-yard cropping. Non-farm adaptation strategies included wage employment, short-term migration and self-employment. Adaptation was facilitated by income-earning opportunities, training, and credit, and impeded by lack of access to water, markets, capital, and extension services. Farmers suggested policy support for dissemination of stress-tolerant cultivars, access to irrigation, and price stabilisation or crop insurance to assist adaptation. While the study shows an impressive degree of awareness and adaptation, external support is needed to increase adaptive capacity.",0.9330558709390212,0.21062251161023673,0.06001780647079728,0.49262729525717774,0.047503270270255485,0.02122202166089692,0.0911755388730792
Gender Differences in Climate Change Adaptation Strategies and Participation in Group-based Approaches: An Intra-household Analysis From Rural Kenya,"Existing studies on adaptation to climate change mainly focus on a comparison of male-headed and female-headed households. Aiming at a more nuanced gender analysis, this study examines how husbands and wives within the same household perceive climate risks and use group-based approaches as coping strategies. The data stem from a unique intra-household survey involving 156 couples in rural Kenya. The findings indicate that options for adapting to climate change closely interplay with husbands' and wives' roles and responsibilities, social norms, risk perceptions and access to resources. A higher percentage of wives were found to adopt crop-related strategies, whereas husbands employ livestock- and agroforestry-related strategies. Besides, there are gender-specific climate information needs, trust in information and preferred channels of information dissemination. Further, it turned out that group-based approaches benefit husbands and wives differently. Policy interventions that rely on group-based approaches should reflect the gender reality on the ground in order to amplify men's and women's specific abilities to manage risks and improve well-being outcomes in the face of accelerating climate change.

Social production of vulnerability to climate change in the rural middle hills of Nepal,"This paper explores the social roots of rural communities' vulnerability to climate change, based on a field study conducted from 2012 to 2015 in the Panchkhal region of the Kavre district in the middle hills of Nepal. Drawing upon Bourdieu's concept 'field of practice', we identify three themes that are helpful to generate insights into the way vulnerability is socially produced in the hamlets of this region: social isolation, financial authority, and knowledge based supremacy exercised by the community elites and public officials. These factors operate to sustain social hierarchies and consequently constrain the long-term adaptability of marginalised groups. Three emergent adaptive strategies are also identified: human mobility, collective action, and occupational change. We conclude that vulnerability to the effects of climate change continues to be a largely socially produced phenomenon, shaped by complex interactions between social, cultural, economic and political processes happening in different places at different time scales.

Perceptions of climate variability and livelihood adaptations relating to gender and wealth among the Adi community of the Eastern Indian Himalayas,"The impacts of extreme weather events and climate variability on natural resource dependent farmers will further increase their vulnerability. This study describes how Adi farmers in Arunachal Pradesh (India) perceive and adapt to climate variability, and how this is influenced by gender and wealth. A total of 65 male and 71 female Adi farmers were interviewed or participated in focus group discussions. Both men and women have noticed there are fewer rainy days, longer summers, shorter winters and more erratic rainfall. However, some perceptions of change were gender and/or wealth class specific. Adi women noticed changes across areas they control including collecting forest foods, crop harvesting, and fermenting and storing of food. Men noted climate variability had made hunting wild game and marketing agricultural produce more difficult. Wealthy people were better placed to adapt to climate variability than poorer people because they could intensify their production systems. They switched to rainfed maize with improved varieties and horticultural cash crops which need more costly inputs. Wealthy people, particularly men, also received more advice and training than poorer people. Poorer farmers, particularly poor women, adapted predominantly by diversifying activities, such as using drought tolerant oil seeds and subsistence horticultural crops, accessing forest-based resources, rearing pigs and poultry, increasing fishing and the making of handicrafts. Storage, exchange and pooling of local resources were further strategies of the poor. This deeper understanding of Adi livelihood adaptation strategies will help increase their resilience by improving targeting of location specific extension services and adaptation policies.

People's experience and facts of changing climate: impacts and responses,"Purpose - This paper aims to explore the local knowledge on climate change, its impacts and the responses they are making at the household or community level to deal with the changes on the basis of their experiences and perceptions. Design/methodology/approach - The study was based on household survey conducted with one male and one female respondent in 202 households. Alongside, series of focused group discussions were conducted with local people to capture the perception on about climate change, its impacts and adaptation strategies applied to enhance their resilience capacity to changing climate. Rainfall and temperature data were collected from Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) for seven and four different stations, respectively, within Kathmandu Valley and analyzed to understand the climatic trend. Findings - The perception of most of the local people on changes in temperature was almost in line with the recorded long-term climatic trend both showing an increasing trend, whereas the perception of decreasing both monsoon and non-monsoon rainfall did not match with the recorded data as the rainfall data analysis did not reflect any clear long-term pattern. People have been facing several impacts such as decrease in water sources, decrease in agricultural crop production, increase in new crop pest and weeds in agricultural crops. Local people are responding to these impacts as per their own skills and traditional knowledge.

Rural Households in a Changing Climate,"This paper argues that climate change poses two distinct, if related, sets of challenges for poor rural households: challenges related to the increasing frequency and severity of weather shocks and challenges related to long-term shifts in temperature, rainfall patterns, water availability, and other environmental factors. Within this framework, we examine evidence from existing empirical literature to compose an initial picture of household-level strategies for adapting to climate change in rural settings. We find that although households possess numerous strategies for managing climate shocks and shifts, their adaptive capacity is insufficient for the task of maintainingulet alone improvinguhousehold welfare. We describe the role of public policy in fortifying the ability of rural households to adapt to a changing climate.",0.5471728496671481,0.3465066028785025,0.10976582204740513,0.5615209036390251,0.03945853479047587,0.06218535107836653,0.17787954969888636
"Factors Influencing Farmers' Climate Change Adaptation in Northern Ghana: Evidence From Subsistence Farmers in Sissala West, Ghana","Most African countries are vulnerable to climate change as a result of poverty, weather extremes, and insufficient governmental agricultural support. Using the case of Sissala West District factors influencing farmers' adaptation to climate change and strategies used to avert climate change impact were determined. A total of 330 small-scale farmers were sampled and their views were analysed using logistic regression model, weighted average index, and frequency table. Weighted average index was used to rank opinions of 150 key informants in focus group discussions. Utilizing the logistic regression model, the study indicated irregular rainfall, high temperature, weather information, and high evaporation as the factors compelling farmers to adapt to climate change. Weighted Average Index used to measure weather extremes revealed that drought and temperature had the highest level of occurrence. Furthermore, climate change adaptation strategies assessed in the study showed that agroforestry practices, drought-resistant crops, and mulching were the most preferred methods. The study concluded that farmers' ability to adapt to climate change can be improved if Environmental Protection Agency and Ministry of Food and Agriculture intensify climate adaptation campaigns, increase access to weather information, and training farmers on adaptable strategies including, but not limited to, alternative sources of livelihood.",0.9679228694710164,0.1814000848975472,0.05517932304024647,0.7148926495240054,0.023514374234964525,0.018384952929243577,0.022085887494437833
Smallholder Response to Hurricane Dean: Creating New Human Ecologies through Charcoal Production,"Natural hazards challenge rural communities' livelihoods, but they may also serve as windows of opportunity for the rural poor in the form of new livelihood strategies. In 2007, Hurricane Dean devastated subsistence and commercial agriculture in the Calakmul municipality of Campeche, Mexico. Charcoal production's importance seems to have increased as a result of Mexican forestry policy decisions related to Dean. Household interviews were carried out to determine the livelihood effects of the storm, and results indicate that while many respondents did not acknowledge the hurricane as a driver, a notable production increase was observed subsequent to the event. This research portrays a shift from hybrid swidden and intensive agriculture to that of an alternative forest strategy, situating it as an example of the adaptive capacity to natural hazards experienced by rural people in the developing world.",0.6794176544810975,0.3651905269257911,0.12448780916678251,0.5177657821654345,0.05995021728339246,0.06044573467664362,0.12479791424227406
Gendered vulnerabilities and grassroots adaptation initiatives in home gardens and small orchards in Northwest Mexico,"With the retreat of the state under neoliberalism, the lack of (or negligible) government and non-governmental support reasserts grassroots initiatives as a global-change strategy. A feminist political ecology approach and the concept of adverse inclusion were used to facilitate an analysis of social differences shaping local-level adaptive responses. Adaptive responses of small farmers in the border village of San Ignacio, Sonora, Mexico, who are increasingly vulnerable to climate change, water scarcity, and changing labor markets were studied. Gender differences in production sites translate into diverse vulnerabilities and adaptive strategies. Local capacities and initiatives should be a focus of research and policy to avoid viewing women and men as passive in the face of global change. The dynamic strategies of San Ignacio women and men in home gardens and small orchards hold lessons for other regions particularly related to adaptation to climate change via agrobiodiversity, water resource management, and diversified agricultural livelihoods.",0.7778042584989369,0.32171339599634285,0.11804868081503396,0.4821192418168307,0.05666285821873808,0.0470118604087354,0.1434782052072179
Climate change adaptation in the Morogoro Region of Tanzania: women's decision-making participation in small-scale farm households,"This article estimates factors influencing the adoption of 18 household and individual-level adaptation practices among small-scale farmers in the Morogoro Region of Tanzania. Using a unique dataset of 343 married women, logistic regression analysis is used to examine adaptation practices ranging from agricultural to coping and livelihood diversification strategies. Specifically, we investigate the role of wives' intrahousehold decision-making participation in adaptation decisions. Drawing on the literatures of intrahousehold bargaining and agricultural technology adoption, we argue that although extrahousehold factors are important determinants of households' adaptation behaviour, adaptation outcomes can also be different when decided by husbands or by wives. We find that when wives are more involved in intrahousehold adaptation decision-making, they are also more likely to choose to be engaged in non-farm income-earning activities, and their households are more likely to plant cover crops and drought-resistant crops. We argue that in general Tanzanian smallholders' adaptation options are limited and their intrahousehold bargaining sets relatively narrow, leaving little room for differing intrahousehold adaptation preferences, especially in the case of quasi-public household goods.",0.8912755297282059,0.23679749544954368,0.08715300647369531,0.5578723254821732,0.0482510080650642,0.031889607532230684,0.035454149807309224
Building urban climate resilience through community-driven approaches to development Experiences from Asia,"Purpose - This paper aims to explore how the implementation of community-driven approaches to improve the living conditions of the urban poor can also have positive co-benefits for resilience to climate change, by addressing the underlying drivers of physical, social and economic vulnerability. Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies a case study approach, drawing from the documented experiences of organised urban poor groups in Asian countries already actively participating in collective settlement upgrading, building networks and financial resources for further action. Findings - The findings show that while certain actions might not be taken with climate change adaptation specifically in mind, these development activities also contribute to broader resilience to climate change, by reducing exposure to risk and addressing other drivers of vulnerability. The findings also show that partnerships between low income communities and other urban stakeholders, including local government, and innovative financial mechanisms managed by communities, can lead to scaled-up action to address development and adaptation deficits. This can lead the way for transformation in socio-political systems. Practical implications - The approaches applied by organised urban poor groups in Asia show that community-level actions can make a positive contribution to building their resilience to climate change, and with local government support and partnership, it could lead to scaled-up actions, through a bottom-up approach to multi-level governance. Originality/value - This paper considers how community-driven actions can build resilience to climate change, and it argues that adaptation and development should be considered together.",0.17147536376542827,0.41298097625811003,0.10621845250200802,0.30500796222413934,0.16988096593182866,0.4373015889154934,0.17573394160445213
Flood vulnerability among rural households in the Red River Delta of Vietnam: implications for future climate change risk and adaptation,"The Red River Delta (RRD) of Vietnam, one of the world's most densely populated deltas, is already vulnerable to flooding events, and climate change forecasts project increased exposure to flood risk in coming decades due to changes in rainfall, storm intensity and frequency, and sea-level rise. However, there is a relative neglect of this region in the literature on natural hazards and climate change, particularly on how floods in the RRD might affect poor people and different livelihood sectors, how flood risk is understood and acted on, and how flood impacts experienced by households influence local adaptation choices. This article presents research undertaken in 2009-2010 to understand the impacts of flooding in a typical rural zone (Thai Binh Province) of the RRD to assess overall vulnerability, particularly the relationship between poverty, livelihoods, and flood impacts, as well as to assess the range of adaptation and flood risk reduction options currently used. Our findings indicate that while poor households do not appear to be more exposed to floods than others, their incomes are more sensitive to relative impacts from floods. Yet poverty alone did not explain flood vulnerability, as age of household and livelihood sector involvement showed stronger relationships to flood impacts. Flood risk perceptions were also uneven, but poor people did not seem to take less proactive flood risk reduction measures than others. There are few long-term adaptation actions to flooding being taken by households of any income class, and there is a need for better community and government aid after flood events to help households cope with increased flood risks in the RRD, rather than relying on improvements in hard infrastructure, as is currently the dominant approach in the region, particularly given future forecasts of increased rainfall for northern Vietnam under climate change.",0.15384904989404224,0.3469772441202769,0.11621304808677968,0.28465946854047475,0.16312134021303282,0.5983758075826462,0.8909207264289374
"Indigenous Adaptation Practices for the Development of Climate Resilient Ecosystems in the Hail Haor, Bangladesh","Human communities inhabiting remote and geomorphically fragile flood plain areas are particularly vulnerable to climate change-related hazards and hydrometeorological extremes. This study presents the community livelihood structure, perception of climate change, and indigenous coping strategies adopted by the local communities in the flood plain areas especially at the Hail haor. Field observations reveal that there have been several recent phenomena that are identified and reported on the manifestations of climate change by the respondent community members. These phenomena includes the following: loss of income (90 %), reduced fish availability (80 %), reduced fish diversity (70 %), reduced migratory bird's availability (70 %), decreased crop production (70 %), food crisis (70 %), reduced aquatic plants availability (60 %), sudden flood (60 %), increased storm (60 %), decreased water-retaining capacity of beels and haor (60 %), increased drought (50 %), temperature rise (50 %), drying of water supply canal (50 %), scattered rainfall patterns (40 %), increased fish diseases during winter season (40 %), increased human viral diseases (20 %), and introduction of unknown paddy diseases (red coloration of plant, 20 %). The indigenous adaptation and coping strategies were identified. The correlations between coping strategies and physical, human, financial, natural, and social assets were significant. From the present field observation, it is evident that livestock rearing, homestead vegetable gardening, increased fishing time, and change in livelihood options found as most effective options to cope with the adverse effect of climate change. By identifying localized climate change disasters with intensity of impacts and analyzing indigenous coping mechanisms, this study attempts to address the community-based adaptation practices in climate change challenges.",0.7866336866412458,0.36043071363868806,0.11457884677968949,0.5,0.06871056283760164,0.046066256852869206,0.20235045387422035
Women’s Perception of Climate Change and Coping Strategies in Pakistan: An Empirical Evidence,"This paper examines the women’s perception about climate change and coping strategies in response to climate-related shocks in Pakistan. It is among the ten countries that have been affected most by climate change. There is no denying the fact that climate change is bringing miseries for the vulnerable population particularly for the rural women. The study used the Treatment Effect Model to evaluate the determinants of women’s perception and adoption of coping strategies using data from Climate Change Impact Survey (PIDE 2013). Secondary data of 3298 rural households in Punjab, Sindh and KPK as provided by Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (2013) were utilized to conduct this research. The results of this study demonstrate that age, education, farming experience, land rights, women empowerment, livestock ownership and change in rainfall are crucial factors for women’s coping strategies to avoid the adverse effect of climate change. There is dire need to raise awareness about climate change in women and provide credit facilities for undertaking adaptation measures, encourage informal social networks and enhance women capacity to climate change. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",0.7046278771487271,0.2847980689217419,0.06824893531922455,0.6714954111253697,0.05081939656069809,0.026130100839765275,0.10655119681859809
A gender approach to understanding the differentiated impact of barriers to adaptation: responses to climate change in rural Ethiopia,"While adaptation has received a fair amount of attention in the climate change debate, barriers to adaptation are the focus of a more specific, recent discussion. In this discussion, such barriers are generally treated as having a uniform, negative impact on all actors. However, we argue that the precise nature and impact of such barriers on different actors has so far been largely overlooked. Our study of two drought-prone communities in rural Ethiopia sets out to examine how female- and male-headed households adapt to climate change, particularly focusing on how a variety of barriers influence the choice of adaptation measures to varying extents. To this purpose, we built a conceptual framework based on the Sustainable Livelihood Approach. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with male- and female-headed households, community leaders and local extension workers. Our findings suggest that gender-based differences in the choice of adaptation measures at the household level are driven by cultural, social, financial and institutional barriers. Barriers to adaptation-particularly when interacting-have a differentiated impact upon different actors. This outcome hints at the need for donors and policymakers to develop intervention strategies that are sensitive to this fact.",0.6631635684366175,0.28552382492814904,0.1097491599650407,0.5483941279595042,0.06310750973937751,0.0946307023746875,0.15942306069572668
Gendered agrobiodiversity management and adaptation to climate change: differentiated strategies in two marginal rural areas of India,"Social and cultural contexts influence power dynamics and shape gender perceptions, roles, and decisions regarding the management of agrobiodiversity for dealing with and adapting to climate change. Based on a feminist political ecology framework and a mixed method approach, this research performs an empirical analysis of two case studies in the northern of India, one in the Himalayan Mountains and another in the Indian-Gangetic plains. It explores context-specific (i) influence of gender roles and responsibilities on on-farm agrobiodiversity management (ii) gendered expertise and knowledge related to agrobiodiversity and (iii) gendered preferences for practices and institutional arrangements for agrobiodiversity conservation linked to adaptation to climate change. In the Himalayan mountains women actively participate in crop and seed management decisions and tasks, and maintain informal institutions for seed and services exchanges in the case of crisis, which simultaneously favours high levels of agrobiodiversity and enhances women's social status. By contrast, in the Indio-Gangetic plains, where women from better-off households are socially secluded and women from poorer households work mainly as labourer to respond to high out-migration of men, they exercise less public control over agrobiodiversity, with their role being mainly invisible at the homestead and related to post-production tasks. We finally discuss as improved understanding of the links between gendered spaces, crops, tasks, social status, and agrobiodiversity management can facilitate the design of gender-sensitive policy interventions for conservation and adaptation to climate change.",0.6671481259537846,0.37880370464486185,0.1595683875259222,0.5705403360790772,0.06020917289504715,0.05038190829131008,0.13295999630363986
Sleeper cells for urban green infrastructure: Harnessing latent competence in greening Dhaka's slums,"The aim of this article is to examine urban green infrastructure (UGI) as a strategy for adaptation to a nexus of challenges facing slum dwellers in Dhaka, Bangladesh. In Bangladesh and elsewhere in the global South urban slum dwellers are often wells of knowledge on sustainable practices through their prior competence developed in rural areas. Due to poverty and frequent natural hazards many rural people take shelter within informal settlements in cities. One of the prime challenges for urban slum dwellers is to harness and distribute their competence within the context of their changed circumstances and in regards to the materials available to them and meanings around which they shape their lives. Pertinent issues such as land insecurity, space constraints, unemployment, crime, corruption and cultural exclusion to name a handful, have created strains on slum dwellers' lives and livelihoods. One important aspect that can enhance slum dwellers' capacity to cope is the harvesting of latent competence as one facet of their overall social practices. The contribution draws upon semi-structured in-depth interviews with slum dwellers in Korail slum, Dhaka and ethnographic observation. In the empirical data, we explore how latent competence in UGI serves as a source of community resilience and 'trickle-up' development action in precarious urban settings through user participation.",0.22035780730510424,0.42935041711605215,0.11386300652550992,0.3942209864429302,0.07584510050694035,0.27712009131224635,0.08290769849383152
"Climate Change, Migration, and Adaptation in the MENA Region","Climate change is a major source of concern in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, and migration is often understood as one of several strategies used by households to respond to changes in climate and environmental conditions, including extreme weather events. Other coping and adaptation strategies include changing the household's sources of livelihood, and selling assets or taking other emergency measures in cases of losses due to extreme weather events. Yet while there is a burgeoning literature on climate change and migration and other adaptation strategies worldwide, the evidence available for the MENA region remains limited, in part because of a lack of survey and other data. This chapter is based in large part on new data collected in 2011 in Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen. Household surveys were implemented in two climate-affected areas in each country. In addition, qualitative focus groups were also implemented in both urban and rural areas. Finally, complementary work was completed using existing data sources for Morocco and the Republic of Yemen. The chapter provides a summary of some of the main findings from these various sources of data, focusing on household perceptions about climate change and extreme weather events, migration, other household coping and adaptation strategies, and government and community responses. Overall, households do perceive important changes in the climate, and many have been affected by extreme weather events with resulting losses in income, crops, livestock, or fish catchment. The coping and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with shocks are diverse but limited, as are the community and government programs which could help households better cope with and adapt to climate change. In terms of migration, in the areas affected by climate change and weather shocks, the analysis suggests that climate factors may account for between one tenth and one fifth of the overall level of migration observed today, but this is likely to increase as climatic conditions continue to deteriorate. While migrants appreciate the opportunities that migration offer, their living conditions and ability to be well integrated in their areas of destination is far from being guaranteed.",0.5623337571669339,0.33921082262200275,0.08667116372965,0.5821001505634437,0.05049890548262946,0.029260169799984415,0.16274469310372128
Local and participatory approaches to building resilience in informal settlements in Uganda,"Many of the people who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change live in low-income and informal settlements in and around urban centres in Africa, Asia and Latin America. While there is a growing recognition of the importance of urban resilience, there is little documented evidence of how collective actions undertaken by residents of these communities can contribute to this. This paper describes the processes adopted by the National Slum Dwellers Federation of Uganda for responding to a variety of challenges - and explains how these not only address the immediate needs of these communities but also contribute to building resilience at the scale of the individual, household, community and city. It links the experiences of manufacturing matoke briquettes, developing new construction materials for low-income housing, and improving drainage and freshwater supplies to some of the key features of an urban resilience agenda, and makes the case for broader international support and funding to these local responses to climate change.",0.15481776184235946,0.4359320333333348,0.11398068990072907,0.36122133011304275,0.1318756498727456,0.3959228979305251,0.20255698275489048
"Poverties and Wealth: Perceptions, Empowerment, and Agency in Sustainable Land Management","This section describes the development processes undertaken by small-scale farmers in the Suid Bokkeveld community in the Northern Cape province of South Africa to manage their land-based resources in a more sustainable manner so as to escape a poverty trap. The development of the Heiveld Cooperative as a local development institution is described, and the ways in which it has supported these processes by providing global market access to members for their organic and Fairtrade-certified rooibos and supported their efforts to adapt more effectively to climatic impacts and to conserve land and other natural resources. Drawing on their common heritage, these farmers have strengthened their sense of identity and found more holistic ways to meet their human needs. Empowerment, enhanced agency, and perceptions of ability to succeed in changing people's circumstances have been crucial in improving their situation and adopting more sustainable land use practices. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Can social capital influence smallholder farmers' climate-change adaptation decisions? Evidence from three semi-arid communities in Burkina Faso, West Africa","This study examines the influence of farmers' social capital on their decisions to deal with climate change and climate variability in Burkina Faso. The study is based on a household survey conducted among 450 households, randomly selected from three communities in Burkina Faso. Two indexes were constructed to capture farmers' structural and cognitive social capital; and using generalized Poisson regression (GPR) and a multivariate probit model, the study probes the effect of farmers' social capital on their choice of adaptation alternatives, the number of adaptation practices used, and the extent to which adaptation measures were applied. The results indicated that the effect of social capital depends on the type of indicator used and on the type of adaptation strategies necessary. Farmers' cognitive social capital was significantly and positively related to their choice of soil and water conservation techniques (SWCT), and techniques such as agroforestry and irrigation. Structural social capital, on the other hand, was positively associated with the adoption of new varieties and conservation tillage strategies and negatively associated with the use of a crop-diversification strategy. The results also highlighted that socio-economic, institutional and agro-ecological variables determine farmers' decisions to adapt to climate change. © 2018 by the authors.",0.9528926236599753,0.24292573478019033,0.08669281812778197,0.6433350512587113,0.05987003416559595,0.023861910067254202,0.0704036884780237
"Coping with climate change: households' response strategies to drought and hailstorm in Lijiang, China","This paper documents rural households' perceptions of and responses to hailstorms and drought, which have been increasingly common in southwest China. This is important as the current coping behaviour serves as a starting point for future adaptations. Primary data were collected from 162 households by a questionnaire survey in three villages in Lijiang, Yunnan province. The results indicate that the majority of households have perceived an increasing occurrence of hailstorm and drought till present. Hailstorms were generally perceived to have more drastic impacts than drought. The most common coping strategy for both was to seek alternative income sources via sideline activities. In addition, there were hazard-specific coping strategies. Migrant work and assets depletion were important to cope with hailstorms while multiple strategies to solve water shortage were deployed during drought. Differences were also found across villages regarding the degree of perceived sensitivity and responses despite similar exposure to climate extremes. These differences are partly related to the nature of events and varied socio-economic characteristics of households, which influence their vulnerability and ability to cope. The study suggests initiatives which could facilitate coping. In addition to providing disaster relief and strengthening technical coping capacity, more efforts could be directed at spreading risk and revitalising livelihoods.",0.7528495130502381,0.23783221683669145,0.056348641300270445,0.6046858875363021,0.05619861140345993,0.048364934869877016,0.309792613032872
Who is responsible for climate change adaptation?,"The mixture of socio-economic classes, ethnicities, and cultures that characterizes many cosmopolitan urban areas can contribute to unequally perceived impacts of extreme weather events and, hence, need and responsibility for adaptation. Awareness of these differences is, as we argue, decisive for effective adaptation. This study explores the relationship between person-specific, socio-economic characteristics that are frequently associated with social vulnerability and the perception of current affectedness by extreme weather events, future impact severity as well as adaptation need and adaptation responsibility. Weuse a large online questionnaire survey from New York City studying two extreme weather events, heatwaves and heavy rainstorms. Wefind that previous harm is the most important factor across all tested models for both weather events. However, previous harm and affectedness do not well explain the perception of future impacts, whereas they correspond to views about adaptation responsibility; respondents who felt significantly more affected in the past perceive the community to be in charge of adaptation. Women (during both weather events) and the elderly (during heatwaves) state largest affectedness during past events, and see the community as being responsible for future adaptation. Hispanic and African American respondents, on the other hand, were identified to perceive adaptation to be more of an individual task-potentially related to previous experience with (a lack of) local government services in their areas. Our findings evoke equity questions, and can aid urban decision makers aiming to implement effective and just adaptation measures, targeting vulnerable socio-economic groups in New York City and potentially other cosmopolitan areas.",0.2639937609844536,0.4022546327737637,0.07136708685758156,0.24322985325990862,0.06943937016820483,0.2591282258397803,0.31238360283590183
"Integrating a ""preventive ethic"" in the post-disaster recovery process: resilience, adaptations and ""preventive reconstruction""","Post-disaster recovery, understood as the set of measures allowing to restore an acceptable functioning of the territory, is a concept which has appeared relatively recently in the scientific and geographical literature of risks. It can be, yet not automatically, addressed by collective and individual, planned and spontaneous coping strategies, which the objectives may vary according to the interests. The anticipation of reconstruction is a major challenge to optimize the integration of a ""preventive ethic"" and, more generally, to facilitate decision-making in the post-disaster period. The study of the phases of the process through medium- and long-term feedback allows us to identify rules, and to define constraining factors and pitfalls in the one hand, and favourable conditions and means of action in the other hand, regarding the Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation to pursue Sustainable Development objectives. This method combines the social science surveys, documentary analysis and GIS, and is carried out several years after the disaster. To illustrate the reasoning and clarify the links between adaptations and resilience, we rely on the analysis of two post-disaster reconstructions in the French metropolitan area: the Aude department after the floods of 12 and 13 November 1999, and the Dracenie area (Var department) following the floods of 15 and 16 June 2010. They are also completed by an analysis of the evolution of risk and disaster management perceptions, and an analysis of long-term memory in the municipality of Cuxac-d'Aude. Examples of adaptations have been integrated into the reconstruction but opportunistically without a real overall strategy. It appears that the catastrophic event alone cannot be the trigger for an increase of resilience and a real strategy of adaptation to risk. Henceforth, the implementation of a preventive reconstruction cannot be improvised: the anticipation effort is as necessary as necessarily limited by the need for ad hoc adjustment of recovery strategies.",0.2404071211562484,0.3565207949891068,0.13305534856527954,0.3366055142179304,0.07987374260586545,0.13233322871934486,0.2735375195862007
Migrants' remittances A complementary source of financing adaptation to climate change at the local level in Ghana,"Purpose - The much-trumpeted Green Climate Fund and several other official financial mechanisms for financing adaptation to climate change under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change have fallen short in meeting adaptation needs. Many poorer people are still grappling with the scourge of climate change impacts. Consequently, there has been a dominant research focus on climate change financing emanating from official development assistance (ODA), Adaptation Fund, public expenditure and private sector support. However, there has been little attempt to examine how migrants' remittances can close adaptation financing gaps at the local level, ostensibly creating a large research gap. This paper aims to argue that migrants' remittances provide a unique complementary opportunity for financing adaptation and have a wider impact on those who are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is aligned to the qualitative research approach. Both secondary and primary data acquired through interviews and focus group discussions were used for the study. Multiple samplingmethods were also used to select the respondents. Findings - The findings show that remittances are used to finance both incremental costs of households' infrastructure and consumption needs, as well as additional investment needs to be occasioned by ongoing or expected changes in climate. Originality/value - In the wake of dwindling government/public revenue, ODA and poor commitment of Annex II countries to fulfil their financial obligations, the study makes the following recommendations: First, the financial infrastructure underpinning money transfers in both sending and recipient countries should be improved to make transfers attractive. Second, significant steps should be taken to reduce the fees on remittance services, especially for the small transfers typically made by poor migrants. Finally, adequate climatic information should be made available to local people to ensure that remittances are applied to the right adaptation option to avoid maladaptation.",0.3230252601492952,0.37915306325250375,0.09643748434491546,0.408856905135961,0.06053382247249316,0.16984324187396524,0.08197473578181713
"How do households respond to coastal hazards? A framework for accommodating strategies using the example of Semarang Bay, Indonesia","Responding to coastal hazards is a daily challenge for populations in low-lying coastal areas all over the globe. How local communities develop accommodating strategies for these hazards remains largely under-emphasized. Filling this knowledge gap is vital to connect the big picture science of sea-level rise with the adaptation needs and capabilities of affected communities. This paper contributes new understanding by presenting the results of original, mixed-methods research (a household survey and focus group discussions) that documents the accommodating strategies of communities and households in the Semarang Bay on northern Java. We find that participatory capacity and self-organization are key factors in enabling communities to live in unstable environments. Coastal hazards have become a normal element of live and are not perceived as severe risks. Rather than retreating or gaining permanent protection, people found ways to accommodate to and hence live with floods. This result adds an important dimension to contemporary theorization of responding to coastal hazards. Although the IPCC (2014) acknowledges 'accommodating' as one form of adaptation alongside 'retreating' and `protecting', it tends to be overlooked as temporary and insubstantial compared with the latter responses. This research finds that accommodating strategies, such as informal loans, are effective means for people to maintain their livelihoods in hazard-affected coastal areas on a more substantial basis than recognized in much of the literature. We therefore argue that accommodating should be distinguished from both long-term adaptation and short-term coping and deserves elevated consideration by researchers examining hazard response modes among coastal populations.",0.20105575109477797,0.4605619129792829,0.08268967066499039,0.3671871022678321,0.5855313822858946,0.33414590542452705,0.20916522554855155
"The impact of climate change on tribal communities in the US: displacement, relocation, and human rights","Tribal communities in the United States, particularly in coastal areas, are being forced to relocate due to accelerated rates of sea level rise, land erosion, and/or permafrost thaw brought on by climate change. Forced relocation and inadequate governance mechanisms and budgets to address climate change and support adaptation strategies may cause loss of community and culture, health impacts, and economic decline, further exacerbating tribal impoverishment and injustice. Sovereign tribal communities around the US, however, are using creative strategies to counter these losses. Taking a human rights approach, this article looks at communities' advocacy efforts and strategies in dealing with climate change, displacement, and relocation.

How rural land use management facilitates drought risk adaptation in a changing climate - A case study in arid northern China,"Under a warming climate, frequent drought and water scarcity in northern China have severely disrupted agricultural production and posed a substantial threat to farmers' livelihoods. Based on first-hand data collected through in-depth interviews with local managers and farmer households, this study evaluated the effectiveness of rural land use management in mitigating drought risk, ensuring food security and improving farmers' livelihoods. Our findings indicate that a) reforestation on low-yield cropland not only can improve the ecoenvironment but can also prominently mitigate the production risk to local farmers; b) replacing the traditional border irrigation with sprinkler irrigation has substantially curbed agricultural water usage and increased the per unit of output; and c) in recent years, instead of planting water-intensive grain crops, local farmers cultivated more forage crops to raise animals, which greatly diversified their income sources and reduced the drought risk of agricultural production. By performing an empirical case study in drought-prone Inner Mongolia, this study provides decision-makers with insights into how to strategically adapt to drought risk and reduce rural poverty within the broader context of climate change.

Traditional gender inequalities limit pastoral women's opportunities for adaptation to climate change: Evidence from the Afar pastoralists of Ethiopia,"Climate change affects different demographic groups differently. Pastoral women, being among the poorest of the poor, are expected to be highly vulnerable to climate change. However, empirical evidence on gender-differentiated vulnerability and adaptive capacity is limited. A triangulation of different techniques including focused group discussions, individual interviews, case studies and structured observations was used to see if there is a difference in factors that determine the level of vulnerability and adaptive capacity between Afar men and women. Gender inequality inherent in the Afar customary tradition (Adda) acts as a risk multiplying factor, resulting in women being more vulnerable than men to climate change-induced food insecurity and related risks. Moreover, men have better scores in different variables determining vulnerability and adaptive capacity, including wealth ownership, wealth inheritance, household-level decision power, opportunities for community-level participation, household burdens and health or body mass index (BMI). Despite their limited scores in many of these factors, Afar pastoral women make higher contributions to household-level adaptation to recurrent drought and weather variability. A gendered approach that recognizes the difference in potentials, limitations and vulnerabilities of pastoral women and men is required for successful implementation of adaptation measures.",0.6529877825542474,0.36709212328220225,0.10970921320136064,0.6100009562396753,0.1104300213937809,0.04544087831536025,0.1576918027396286
"Changes in agricultural system as farmers adapt to economic-social and climatic changes in the min upriver rural areas in western Sichuan, southwestern China","Rapid economic growth in China has brought about great economic-social changes in rural areas, having considerable impact on the society in economy and environment. With a per capita possession of about 0.08 ha of cropland, Chinese farmers in rural areas adopt various ways in response to these changes in a bit to maintain their livelihood, wherein the agricultural system is facing one more options possible. To understand how rural communities have used different mechanisms to adapt to the economic and natural changes, we joined a survey in dry valleys of the Min upriver area under Maoxian county of western Sichuan province, southwestern China and visited the local people. Changes in the main crop cultivation have shown up an important means to keep up their household income. Farm households start seeking economic growth through diversified cultivating of cereal and economic crops in five lines, namely cereal, apple monoculture, apple and vegetables, plum and vegetables, mixed fruits and vegetables. These new lines mirror farmers' flexibility to cope with today's economic-social and climatic changes. The farming operation has changed all the more from a subsistence on grain to special agricultural products. Economic reforms in the early 1980s motivated the progress first in conversion of production from grain to fruits, and the desire to increase family income turned out to be an impetus for the subsequent events. At present, more farmers moving out of the rural areas, uneasy availability of labor force, increased opportunity cost of labors and their wages, increased farm size, and the urgent demand for the agricultural labor force, all these combine into the trend of the agricultural system of China on facing further economic-social reforms and reconstruction of the countryside across China.",0.9386500557860148,0.2776640651174604,0.0745357965847665,0.6286201477180626,0.03613740190193374,0.021320191630967572,0.05395466249597699

How Do Capital Asset Interactions Affect Livelihood Sensitivity to Climatic Stresses? Insights From the Northeastern Floodplains of Bangladesh,"This paper offers a novel methodological approach for better understanding how different capital assets can be organized, transformed, and used in different combinations to reduce livelihood sensitivity to climatic stresses - an area that requires greater research attention in the context of adaptation policy. Research was conducted in the northeastern floodplain communities of Bangladesh, regarded as one of the most climate sensitive, resource poor, and highly understudied areas of the country. This wetland-dominated ecosystem is home to diverse resources user groups (e.g., farmer and fisher) who are subjected to regular seasonal flooding, excessive rainfall, drought, and flash floods. Working in 12 adjacent villages of two significant wetlands (Hakaluki haor and Tanguar haor), qualitative and quantitative data were collected through 15 focus groups (n = 15), 35 key informant interviews, and 356 household surveys to better understand how community members adapt in response to their livelihood sensitivity to the climatic stresses. Results indicate that community members organize and transform capital assets in diverse ways to escape climate-induced ""poverty traps"". Findings also reveal that interventions from external agencies (e.g., government, non-governmental organizations and market institutions) are an important key to livelihood sustainability for many households.",0.5344492610329704,0.397728742323181,0.10934743626883224,0.5837220311488414,0.07234486655838512,0.06847874417083565,0.1176343873193482
Land-based adaptation to global change: What drives soil and water conservation in western Africa?,"Conservation of land resources is a promising strategy for sustainable agricultural intensification in order to adapt dryland farming systems to climate, market and other stresses. At a local level, factors that drive the adoption of conservation measures operate and interact in specific ways. Linking our knowledge of the local specifications of these drivers to regional and global patterns of vulnerability can significantly enhance our understanding of land-based adaptation to global change. However, the factors that influence the adoption of conservation practices remain actively debated. Therefore, this study presents a meta-analysis of case studies that investigate the adoption of soil and water conservation measures, as an important approach to resource conservation. Synthesising 63 adoption cases in the drylands of western Africa, this meta-analysis reveals a multitude of factors that drive the adoption of soil and water conservation practices. The drivers differ strongly between particular practices and methods of analysis used in the case studies. Contributing to the broader debate on resource conservation, the findings highlight the adoption of soil and water conservation measures as an emergent property of farming systems. They demonstrate the need to better understand the socio-ecological foundation of adoption and the pathways along which adoption evolves in space and time. This study concludes with methodological principles to advance future research on the factors that drive the adoption of soil and water conservation measures as a pre-requisite of improving land-based adaptation efforts.

HOW DO AFRICAN FARM HOUSEHOLDS RESPOND TO CHANGES IN CURRENT AND PAST WEATHER PATTERNS? A STRUCTURAL PANEL DATA ANALYSIS FROM MALAWI,"We use three waves of nationally representative household-level panel data from Malawi to estimate a structural model characterizing the response of smallholder farm households to current and past weather patterns, and the subsequent impacts on household net income. We also quantify heterogeneity among households along the wealth spectrum regarding their ability to adapt to evolving weather patterns. This approach yields two key findings. First, adverse weather history prompts households to devote more time to maize cultivation on their own farms, to the detriment of other, possibly more remunerative income sources. Households also reduce application of productivity-enhancing inputs, such as fertilizer and improved maize varieties, in response to adverse weather history. Our results are robust to different clustering structures and falsification tests aimed at ruling out alternative explanations to observed trends. Second, we find that, by maintaining a more diversified income structure, wealthier households are better able to adapt to adverse weather history. Consequently, adverse changes in past weather may be regressive in nature, creating a ""climate-induced"" poverty trap that locks poor smallholder households into low-value maize cultivation from season to season. This finding suggests that developing more weather-resilient maize varieties and promoting smallholder livelihood diversification strategies may help mitigate the effects of adverse weather on the most vulnerable households.",0.840806720165658,0.2645997043535238,0.07489857759584384,0.5938441883867949,0.035475229707774336,0.03561105984444154,0.032749802222167654
Multiple shocks and risk management strategies among rural households in Zambia's Mazabuka District,"The objective of this study was to document the kinds of shocks or set-backs and events that commonly cause households to become poorer or destitute and the kinds of risk management strategies they utilize in order to prevent, mitigate or cope with the shocks. The study was conducted in Magobbo area which is located in Mazabuka District in Zambia's Southern Province using qualitative research methods and techniques. The results show that the majority Magobbo households face multiple covariant and idiosyncratic shocks which have led to downward economic mobility or increased poverty. Some of the shocks include market access challenges caused by market liberalization policies; increased morbidity and mortality due to the HIV and AIDS pandemic and other diseases; adverse consequences of climate change and deterioration of the natural resources; adverse consequences of family breakdown caused by spousal abandonment, divorce and widowhood. The study results also show that the households practice several coping mechanisms to address shocks and set-backs that affect them. These coping mechanisms include a range of prevention, mitigation and coping strategies. © 2014 by the author(s).",0.6652404383089693,0.29649267378892397,0.09137487900019929,0.5643675001101768,0.05872755190552392,0.03655798806886041,0.06452291047847866
"Impact of Climate Change in Eastern Madhya Pradesh, India","This paper reports case studies in eastern Madhya Pradesh - a central Indian province - on community adaptation strategies for sustainable livelihood options. With about 90% of the region being rain-fed, erratic rainfalls in the last fifteen years have caused up to a 60% decrease in crop yields, directly impacting the food security of the region. The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and horticultural expansion are adaptation measures for tackling climate change. The expansion of kitchen gardens from subsistence-level to commercial-level is another significant development in the region. Meanwhile, increased pressure on common lands has caused fuelwood scarcity for households and decreased livestock fodder. While output of most non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has reduced drastically due to unsustainable extraction, production of mahua (Madhuca indica) has not suffered as much, thanks to a community-managed user regime. Community-based institutions have the potential to support the ecosystem-based livelihoods of forest-dependent communities.",0.8713998510905819,0.25185183493426694,0.14612489912820284,0.48928738508425723,0.08632051790584544,0.02456330094603595,0.07375561232254113
Development projects for small rural communities in the Brazilian Amazon region as potential strategies and practices of climate change adaptation,"Climate scenarios for the Amazon region (Brazil) indicate an increase in temperature and a precipitation decrease, affecting society and economic activities, particularly small-scale rural communities. The research aims to identify, describe and evaluate factors present in sustainable development projects for small rural communities (Type- A Demonstration Projects - PDA and Alternatives to Deforestation and Burnt Projects - PADEQ), already implemented, for recognizing its potential use as strategies for adaptation to climate change for small rural communities in the Amazon region. The researches, concerning fifteen projects in Rondonia, Para and Mato Grosso States, were developed through document analysis, technical visits, and interviews with stakeholders of three projects about the community perception, vulnerability and adaptation capacity. The analysis of documents regarding the potential success of the projects highlights their short history, important in the local context, prospects for continuity, and community participation in decision making. Few activities developed in projects could be associated with climate change adaptation practices. Two strategies and practices are the most important: the social organization and the process of awareness and training of the community, and the diversification of the types and forms of agricultural production. The interviews indicate that adaptation is implemented in projects, but without considering the pressures of climate variability and change. While these projects were not planned in the context of climate change, the greatest role of the projects relates to the strengthening of the already existing adaptation capacity, creating good conditions for incorporation of new strategies and adaptation measures, now clearly associated to the objective to reduce the vulnerability to climate change and variability impacts.",0.7543174126551907,0.39953152683387216,0.14187889493825595,0.42850914953041297,0.21854615191565768,0.054917185048752606,0.14292871987497385
"Country, climate change adaptation and colonisation: insights from an Indigenous adaptation planning process, Australia","Indigenous peoples are going to be disproportionately affected by climate change. Developing tailored, place based, and culturally appropriate solutions will be necessary. Yet finding cultural and institutional 'fit' within and between competing values-based climate and environmental management governance regimes remains an ongoing challenge. This paper reports on a collaborative research project with the Arabana people of central Australia, that resulted in the production of the first Indigenous community-based climate change adaptation strategy in Australia. We aimed to try and understand what conditions are needed to support Indigenous driven adaptation initiatives, if there are any cultural differences that need accounting for and how, once developed they be integrated into existing governance arrangements. Our analysis found that climate change adaptation is based on the centrality of the connection to 'country' (traditional land), it needs to be aligned with cultural values, and focus on the building of adaptive capacity. We find that the development of climate change adaptation initiatives cannot be divorced from the historical context of how the Arabana experienced and collectively remember colonisation. We argue that in developing culturally responsive climate governance for and with Indigenous peoples, that that the history of colonisation and the ongoing dominance of entrenched Western governance regimes needs acknowledging and redressing into contemporary environmental/climate management.",0.30863942293651286,0.4384982889930449,0.22162303571214964,0.321164059940726,0.15106354045900228,0.12497733747762646,0.17772316288481957
Combination of community-based vulnerability and adaptation to storm surges in coastal regions of Bangladesh,"Bangladesh has been identified as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change and rising sea-level. This is because it is located at the northern end of the funnel-shaped Bay of Bengal, and as a consequence it has experienced a number of severe storm surges in the last three decades. The inhabitants of the coastal region are very poor, and the surges have pushed them to a ""tipping-point""; that is, the point of desperation which is exacerbating the socio-economic threats to their existence. The study reported here aimed to explore the perceptions of coastal communities with regard to vulnerability and adaptation (V & A) strategies in four different areas of Bangladesh in order to reduce their vulnerability to future storm surges. After reviewing the impact assessment guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), United States Country Studies Program (USCSP) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the researchers applied the Participatory Rapid Appraisal (PRA) method (a behavioural environmental decision-making tool) to survey 160 participants in four case-study areas, with 20 participants in two sessions in each case. The evaluation of V & A was implemented and prioritised in this study by a measuring scale, called the ""weighted matrix index"". This study not only considered the integrated assessment of V & A but it also classified the levels of vulnerability and adaptation in different categories. Additionally, it provides a comparative picture of the vulnerabilities for similar risks in different types of communities. These key aspects demonstrate and emphasise that adaptation policy needs to be implemented immediately in Bangladesh in order to reduce and manage future vulnerability in the coastal region under the potential climate change regimes. © 2014 Imperial College Press.",0.2650150032603161,0.4083433162842393,0.11444646893265749,0.32843725377587485,0.4422999520756253,0.313125134271808,0.10712853264173632
Limitations and opportunities of social capital for adaptation to climate change: a case study on the Isles of Scilly,"Small islands are among regions most affected by the impacts of global climate change. They are regarded as particularly vulnerable, but from a different point of view, island societies also feature a particular sociocultural resilience, which distinguishes them from continental societies. How do social structures increase the adaptive capacity of small islands towards sea-level rise? I consider the concept of social capital as applicable in order to understand the role of communities and collective action in a context of vulnerability and resilience. In this paper, I present results from a case study on the Isles of Scilly, UK. A mixed methods qualitative approach has been applied to analyse the various roles of social capital for the adaptation to climate change impacts on this small archipelago, which is representative of European small islands in an economically advanced, but isolated context. The Isles of Scilly are among the most vulnerable island regions in Europe. The results of the research contribute to the general discussion on social capital and the relevance of collective action for the adaptation to global climate change. How useful is the concept? And how relevant is it for small islands, such as the Isles of Scilly?",0.45571688199427557,0.4923821571745017,0.1229019911633595,0.4546003905166686,0.2623053258125522,0.18981967224269772,0.2422789922983028
Sustainable adaptation for resolving climate displacement issues of south eastern islands in Bangladesh,"Purpose - Climate change is affecting people displacement in Bangladesh by both sudden environmental events and gradual environmental change. This paper aims to assess the sustainable adaptation measures for resolving the displacement problem induced by climate change considering the socioeconomic differences between the past and the present location of living places for island dwellers of the south-eastern coast of Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach - Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were adopted for conducting the study. The main tool of the household survey was a questionnaire survey. In addition to the estimate of displacement, the authors have used hazard impact analysis, weightage analysis and sustainable adaptation analysis with various ranking. Meaningful data were analyzed through SPSS software and presented through statistical techniques. Findings - Climate change-induced different natural disasters, such as cyclone, tidal surge, tidal flood and coastal erosion, were frequent in the study areas and responsible for mass displacement. After displacement, people lost not only their identity but also social and cultural harmony and faced different economic and environmental crises. However, nearly 20 types of adaptation options were identified for protection from the displacement of coastal people. Practical implications - The study prescribed 11 specific criteria and 4 principles of sustainable adaptation options for resolving the climate displacement problem. Moreover, seven adaptation practices showed high sustainability, ten showed medium sustainability and five showed low sustainability in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and implementation ability. Originality/value - The study would help to establish sustainable adaptation measures through the combination of environment, economic and social harmony with regard to the Sustainable Development Goals.",0.49417783789398523,0.3582811701887991,0.09620228382333769,0.34553822127251865,0.2136182337484569,0.22714491845228743,0.10012464693465124
"Vulnerability to climate change and residents' adaptations in coastal areas of Soc Trang Province, Vietnam","Many climate-sensitive areas and communities are insufficiently prepared for climate change induced natural disasters due to a mismatch of perceptions and the risks and economic limitations associated with these disasters. The Mekong Delta of Vietnam, which is home to a growing population that currently stands at 17.2 million people, has been experiencing more frequent and severe flooding, especially in Soc Trang Province. Historical and present-day images obtained using an uncrewed aerial vehicle and satellites showed rapid erosion of coastal areas and damage to infrastructure for flood control. A perception survey on more than a thousand residents conducted in 2014 showed that the adaptations pursued at the community level were limited by economic factors and education level. Finally, multiple strategies harmonised with local ecosystems and livelihoods were proposed to protect the area against climate change induced events.",0.2771220395247788,0.3515724547103122,0.1489639384725063,0.3218346744573238,0.16066336460367414,0.2904585497953331,0.37692211996866265
Characterizing behavioral adaptation to climate change in temperate forests,"The potential impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems are well recognized, and a wide variety of adaptation measures have been proposed. However, little is known about whether and how adaptation is occurring among people in these ecosystems. Understanding adaptation at the level of individuals, including members of households and extended families, is especially important because it is the level at which people most directly experience climate change impacts and engage in behavioral change. I offer a framework for characterizing the responses of individual landowners to climate change impacts in terms of adaptation behavior, and distinguishing adaptation from coping. The framework expands existing typologies of adaptation behavior to include a hierarchy of three analytical units of behavior: activities, practices, and strategies. I illustrate the framework by applying it to landowners' responses to climate change impacts in temperate forests, a biome that is undergoing dramatic change. Individuals own and rely on large proportions of land in many temperate forest countries and are therefore exposed and sensitive to climate change impacts. Through management, they also influence how forests and their own well-being are affected by climate change. By improving characterizations of behavioral responses to climate change, the framework I propose can help researchers and practitioners evaluate progress toward adaptation with greater rigor.",0.3099966266205042,0.3497401143969365,0.2409598558186849,0.27302126741676225,0.06608128642696079,0.1113171645702589,0.08677219729736739
Adaptation to climate change in glaciated mountain regions,"Understanding of the human dimensions of climate change (HDCC) in glaciated mountain regions is limited by a deficit in systematically collated information on where, to what stressors, by whom, at what scale, and with what effect adaptation is occurring. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the recent English language peer-reviewed scholarship on adaptation in glaciated mountain regions. 4050 potentially relevant articles were examined, with 36 included for full review. Results indicate that scholarly investigation into adaptation in glaciated mountains is presently limited to only 40 % of countries with alpine glaciation. Seventy-four discrete adaptation initiatives were identified, with most occurring in Peru (28 %), Nepal (22 %) and India (17 %). Many documented adaptations were initiated in response to intersecting stressors related to cryospheric change and socioeconomic development; were autonomous and initiated in reaction to experienced climatic stimuli; and were carried out at the individual, family, or community scale. The study contributes to an emerging literature tracking on-the-ground adaptation processes and outcomes, and identifies a need to raise the profile of human adaptation in glaciated mountain regions within the HDCC scholarship.

"Vulnerability of Subsistence Systems Due to Social and Environmental Change: A Case Study in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska","Arctic Indigenous communities have been classified as highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The remoteness of Arctic communities, their dependence upon local species and habitats, and the historical marginalization of Indigenous peoples enhances this characterization of vulnerability. However, vulnerability is a result of diverse historical, social, economic, political, cultural, institutional, natural resource, and environmental conditions and processes and is not easily reduced to a single metric. Furthermore, despite the widespread characterization of vulnerability, Arctic Indigenous communities are extremely resilient as evidenced by subsistence institutions that have been developed over thousands of years. We explored the vulnerability of subsistence systems in the Cup'ik village of Chevak and Yup'ik village of Kotlik through the lens of the strong seasonal dimensions of resource availability. In the context of subsistence harvesting in Alaska Native villages, vulnerability may be determined by analyzing the exposure of subsistence resources to climate change impacts, the sensitivity of a community to those impacts, and the capacity of subsistence institutions to absorb these impacts. Subsistence resources, their seasonality, and perceived impacts to these resources were investigated via semi-structured interviews and participatory mapping-calendar workshops. Results suggest that while these communities are experiencing disproportionate impacts of climate change, Indigenous ingenuity and adaptability provide an avenue for culturally appropriate adaptation strategies. However, despite this capacity for resiliency, rapid socio-cultural changes have the potential to be a barrier to community adaptation and the recent, ongoing shifts in seasonal weather patterns may make seasonally specific subsistence adaptations to landscape particularly vulnerable.",0.5639794689940721,0.46646470774966986,0.2072290026640713,0.5,0.15663117641657245,0.06133185031369675,0.0863130010173569
"Mountain inhabitants' perspectives on climate change, and its impacts and adaptation based on temporal and spatial characteristics analysis: a case study of Mt. Yulong Snow, Southeastern Tibetan Plateau","Based on the results of questionnaires issued to 202 local residents in the Mount Yulong Snow region, southeastern Tibetan Plateau, this study analyzes mountain residents' perspectives on climate change and its impacts, their strategies to adapt to climate change impacts, including their willingness or otherwise to become ecological migrants, and some of the factors that influence their perceptions. Overall, local perception of climate change and its impacts corresponds to the patterns of observed climate change revealed by climate records. The intensity of climate change perception shows a highly significant correlation with residents' age and villages' elevation gradient. Most respondents did not believe that climate change affected crop growing and their yields, but the number of crop insect pests was thought to be increasing slightly and the crop growth period to be extending. Nearly all respondents believed that climate change seriously affects the mountain tourism economy, and their way of life and spiritual world. Persistent drought in recent years has forced mountain dwellers to adjust industrial structure, save water in the agricultural economy, participate in mountain tourism and work outside the home in order to adapt to climate change impacts and supplement their meager farm incomes.

Agricultural Biodiversity in Climate Change Adaptation Planning,"Climate change is one of the biggest threats to food production worldwide. Recently, an increasing number of initiatives have embraced the concept of climate smart agriculture to respond to climate change adaptation and mitigation challenges. A central component of this approach is the use of agricultural biodiversity at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels for increasing productivity, adaptability and resilience of agricultural production systems. This paper analyses the extent to which the use of agricultural biodiversity is included in the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) developed by 50 least developed countries to guide their actions in relation to climate adaptation. The results of the analyses indicate that in the majority of the NAPAs, agricultural biodiversity has not been incorporated in a comprehensive manner and that increased efforts can be done at national and international levels for effectively making agricultural biodiversity work for most vulnerable countries' adaptation to climate change.",0.7031418457988995,0.24936656632582044,0.179797739917136,0.31514118305705136,0.08860521786732552,0.07469184619117343,0.044273499145988604
"Conservation agriculture and gendered livelihoods in Northwestern Cambodia: decision-making, space and access","Smallholder farmers in Rattanakmondol District, Battambang Province, Cambodia face challenges related to soil erosion, declining yields, climate change, and unsustainable tillage-based farming practices in their efforts to increase food production within maize-based systems. In 2010, research for development programs began introducing agricultural production systems based on conservation agriculture (CA) to smallholder farmers located in four communities within Rattanakmondol District as a pathway for addressing these issues. Understanding gendered practices and perspectives is integral to adapting CA technologies to the needs of local communities. This research identifies how gender differences regarding farmers' access to assets, practices, and engagement in intra-household negotiations could constrain or facilitate the dissemination of CA. Our mixed-methods approach includes focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, famer field visits, and a household survey. Gender differences in access to key productive assets may affect men's and women's individual ability to adapt CA. Farmers perceive the practices and technologies of CA as labor-saving, with the potential to reduce men's and women's labor burden in land-preparation activities. However, when considered in relation to the full array of productive and reproductive livelihood activities, CA can disproportionately affect men's and women's labor. Decisions about agricultural livelihoods were not always made jointly, with socio-cultural norms and responsibilities structuring an individual's ability to participate in intra-household negotiations. While gender differences in power relations affect intra-household decision-making, men and women household members collectively negotiate the transition to CA-based production systems.",0.9601516489679293,0.24780595308881972,0.08040085633321783,0.6552726488397818,0.03303234765715375,0.00836338569996697,0.051266393419640205
Connecting climate social adaptation and land use change in internationally adjoining protected areas,"The development of climate adaptation strategies to address social problems derived from climate change is pressing. Yet, in addition to providing means to minimise the impact of climate variability and change on livelihoods, climate adaptation strategies might exacerbate environmental change and cause negative social impacts. Systematic research has not addressed the impacts of adaptation on environmental change. In this paper, I focus on land use change as a specific type of environmental change and on three adaptation strategies: diversification, pooling and out-migration. I analyse the influence of adaptation strategies on land use change by drawing on interviews with the managers of 56 internationally adjoining protected areas in 18 countries in the Americas. The findings indicate that the impact of adaptation depends on the adaptation strategy people choose. When people out-migrate, land use change increases. Community elite control for decision-making, shorter distances between communities and markets and more communities in and around the protected areas also increase land use change. These findings show that adaptation can be a driver of further environmental change, and thus further study is needed to understand the likely impacts of adaptation on conservation.",0.5350033780672228,0.38311612503083964,0.17383946843995673,0.48282636219753233,0.2021663330393867,0.06665537552877987,0.05077513261696673
"Autonomous adaptation to global environmental change in peri-urban settlements: Evidence of a growing culture of innovation and revitalisation in Mathare Valley Slums, Nairobi","The growth of pen-urban areas is increasingly recognised as a dominant planning and urban design challenge for the 21st century. In burgeoning poor urban settlements growing on city margins, autonomous adaptation strategies are often the only measures to respond to increasing climatic and compounding stressors. Yet, in both research and practice there remains lack of understanding regarding the dynamics of adaptation and risk reduction at the level of the community. In this paper, we argue urban slums are ideal places to consider adaptation because they offer examples of more extreme social-ecological stress than one finds in more established communities - the kind we can anticipate more broadly in the face of climate change. A framework for identifying local adaptation processes is presented and applied to analyse the case of Mathare Valley Slums in Nairobi, Kenya - a densely populated suburb, where residents are regularly exposed to flooding from heavy rainfall. Findings reveal that slums, often viewed as illegitimate, makeshift, and temporary settlements, are places experienced by many residents as permanent communities characterised by rapid environmental change. Processes of adaptation in Mathare have become institutionalised through time, as anew generation of people imagine themselves staying and (re)organise to achieve a higher level of functioning through various strategies to reduce risk. Innovative and revitalising adaptation occurs as residents shift from employing more generic and expected coping strategies, such as evacuating homes or economic diversification, to creating ""gated"" communities and savings schemes to maintain and improve the settlement, despite uncertain tenure. Both formal and informal institutions, such as youth groups, play an important role in governing such heterogeneous localities, incrementally upgrading the slum and providing critical public services. Long-term residents' increasing recognition of the permanence of the slum community and its stressful conditions appears to lead to more collective action toward adaptation pathways. However, this is in marked contrast to the dominant non-local perspective of Mathare's status as both impermanent and illegal, which prevails among government officials. As such, strategies are generally not incorporated into planned interventions. While progressive policies designed to reduce risk exist, they remain nascent in their establishment and fail to benefit slumdwellers. The case illustrates the need to incorporate the wealth of knowledge, techniques, and experience extant at the community level in the development of adaptation planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Climate change awareness, coping mechanisms and adaptation in poor rural coastal communities, Ben Tre Province, Vietnam","Ben Tre Province in Vietnam is ranked among the most vulnerable places in Asia to climate change events. We conducted a study to evaluate community knowledge, awareness, perception severity, coping mechanism and adaptation to climate change in Ben Tre Province. Community members were aware of changing climatic conditions. About 90% of respondents suffered losses from salt water intrusion. Households adopted coping mechanisms to deal with these changes. Age, education and previous affliction with climate change events influence knowledge, awareness, perception of severity and preparedness to manage climate change events. Local governments proposed adaptation strategies such as building of dikes to prevent salt water intrusion and developing of irrigation systems. Of the two adaptation strategies evaluated to losses from climate change, the sea dike system protected more land but the irrigating system was more cost effective in mitigating losses from climate change.",0.6859372523305536,0.3534084314729229,0.1356203701265286,0.37628158702067027,0.0889363096849326,0.05570734688911158,0.21174235585965656
Determinants of perceptions of climate change and adaptation among Turkana pastoralists in northwestern Kenya,"There is a growing concern that climate variability and change, combined with other environmental, social and political pressures, may overwhelm resilience of pastoral systems if local adaptation strategies are not strengthened. Understanding pastoralists' perception of and response to climatic change is necessary for sustainable adaptation strategies. Systematic and purposive sampling techniques were used to select 302 households in Turkana County of northwestern Kenya. Descriptive statistics and Heckman probit model were used to analyse the data obtained from the household's interviews. The results show that majority of households' perceive rise in temperatures and rainfall variability over the past three decades. Pastoralists' perception of climate change was significantly (p<.05) associated with gender of the household head, livestock ownership, herd size and access to extension services. Heckman's sample selectivity probit model revealed that factors influencing pastoralist's choices of climate change adaptation include gender and education level of the household head, household size, wealth in terms of livestock ownership, distance to markets, access to credit and extension services. We conclude that as a prerequisite for long-term commitment to household's climate resilience, policies and programmes should aim at improving these factors.",0.8588953223512458,0.2523039299361499,0.1042716538562835,0.7011123892088463,0.026566966809014127,0.02644909364721944,0.02691318502589472
"Smallholder farmers’ resilience in rural-ecological crises: Case studies from West Java, Indonesia","Recent studies on the resilience of rural farmers in developing regions revealed a close connection between vulnerability, adapted livelihood mechanisms/strategies, and livelihood resilience. Resilience is reflected by the smallholder farmers’ capacity for survival. This paper tries to understand the nexus between the ecological vulnerability of a rural agricultural community suffering from detrimental effects of climate variability and farmers’ ways of adapting to the changing environment. Drawn from empirical research carried out in several ecologically critical agricultural regions of Indonesia, the study notes several adaptive livelihood mechanisms that reflect the way rural people withstand crises. By adapting to crises, these people constructively build resilience. Three adaptive mechanisms that increase livelihood resilience are economic adaptive mechanisms, ecological adaptive mechanisms, and social adaptive mechanisms. Farmers adopt a set of strategies to survive such as crop diversification, utilizing available natural resources, selling assets, asking for help, borrowing money, and creating and using social-network-based collective action to guarantee social security. The study used qualitative and quantitative methodologies to gain data and information. The study proposes that livelihood resilience develops as a response to ecological vulnerability. The authors conclude that rural livelihood resilience is the result of a set of continual adaptations that smallholder farmers employ to respond to crises and vulnerabilities. © Common Ground Publishing, Arya Hadi Dharmawan, Eka Intan Kumala Putri, and Dyah Ita Mardiyaningsih, All Rights Reserved.",0.9099146864394948,0.32127601665560507,0.11199363342051415,0.7200696156316624,0.031295603461042744,0.019126436769196883,0.06191317271803129
Responses to climate and economic risks and opportunities across national and ecological boundaries: changing household strategies on the Mongolian plateau,"Climate changes on the Mongolian Plateau are creating new challenges for the households and communities of the region. Much of the existing research on household choices in response to climate variability and change focuses on environmental risks and stresses. In contrast, our analysis highlights the importance of taking into account environmental and economic opportunities in explaining household adaptation choices. We surveyed over 750 households arrayed along an ecological gradient and matched across the national border in Mongolia and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, asking what changes in livelihoods strategies households made over the last ten years, and analyzed these choices in two broad categories of options: diversification and livestock management. We combined these data with remotely sensed information about vegetation growth and self-reported exposure to price fluctuations. Our statistical results showed that households experiencing lower ecological and economic variability, higher average levels of vegetation growth, and with greater levels of material wealth, were often those that undertook more actions to improve their conditions in the face of variability. The findings have implications both for how interventions aimed at supporting ongoing choices might be targeted and for theory construction related to social adaptation.",0.6688246341075008,0.29539993950826016,0.09462818683338618,0.6106120104059221,0.09351540161917421,0.051065820650685094,0.08004583557209788
"The Politics of Adaptation: Subsistence Livelihoods and Vulnerability to Climate Change in the Koyukon Athabascan Village of Ruby, Alaska","The concepts of vulnerability and adaptation have contributed to understanding human responses to climate change. However, analysis of the implications of the broader political context on adaptation has largely been absent. Through a case study of the subsistence livelihoods of Koyukon Athabascan people of Ruby Village, this paper examines the implications of adaptation to the social changes precipitated by colonization for the articulation of current responses to climate change. Semi-structured interviews, seasonal rounds, and land-use mapping conducted with 20 community experts indicate that subsistence livelihoods are of continued importance to the people of Ruby in spite of the dramatic social change. While adaptive responses demonstrate resilience, adaptation to one form of change can increase vulnerability to other kinds of perturbations.

What is Autonomous Adaption? Resource Scarcity and Smallholder Agency in Thailand,"The concept of autonomous adaptation is widely used to describe spontaneous acts of reducing risks posed by resource scarcity and, increasingly, climate change. Critics, however, have claimed it is unproven, or simplifies the agency by which smallholders respond to risk. This paper presents empirical research in eight Karen villages in Thailand to identify how resource scarcity is linked to adaptive responses including livelihood diversification. The paper argues that autonomous adaptation is driven by how environmental change and scarcity present livelihood risks, rather than physical risks alone. Adaptation planning therefore should acknowledge different experiences of risk, and socio-economic barriers to adaptation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding climate change impacts on water buffalo production through farmers' perceptions,"Climate variability and change will increasingly harm crop and livestock systems worldwide. Evidence of climate change impacts are largely documented for crops with much less information for livestock. In this study we assessed smallholders' risk perceptions of climate change impacts on water buffalo production systems in Nueva Ecija, Philippines. Results from a household survey with 310 water buffalo farmers revealed that they are highly aware of climate change to which they ascribed to an increasing frequency of extreme events such as extreme rainfall, floods, typhoons and extreme heat. Perceptions of climate change risks strongly depended on the level of exposure and vulnerability to these extreme events. Feed availability and animal health were identified as the production aspects most severely affected by the multiple weather extremes, posing productivity risks and compelling farmers to adapt. Adaptation measures in the study area have been spontaneous and based on economic drivers rather than planned. These measures included biophysical and farm operational adjustments such as relocation of animals, adjusting forage planting times, use of crop residues, and shifting from rice cropping to buffalo dairying after recurring rice harvest failures. We suggest that there is a need for development of specific and longer-term adaptation measures that are planned to fit the water buffalo sector.",0.9074140492432546,0.1945596094805868,0.09770210806212383,0.2929258941694836,0.021125731923635406,0.052937190962624725,0.14822688240365117
Climate change adaptation and the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF): Qualitative insights from policy implementation in the Asia-Pacific,"Least developed countries often lack the requisite capacity to implement climate change adaptation projects. The Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) is a scheme where industrialized countries have (as of early 2016) disbursed $934.5 million in voluntary contributions, raised more than four times that amount in co-financing, and supported 213 adaptation projects across 51 least developed countries. But what sorts of challenges have arisen during implementation? Based on extensive field research in five least developed countries-Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, the Maldives, and Vanuatu-and original data collected from almost 150 research interviews, this article qualitatively explores both the benefits and challenges of LDCF projects in the Asia-Pacific. It finds that while LDCF projects do contribute to enhancing multiple types of infrastructural, institutional, and community-based adaptive capacity, they also suffer from uncertainty, a convoluted management structure, and an inability to fully respond to climate risks. Based on these findings, the study concludes that adaptation must be pursued as a multidimensional process; and that LDCF activities have tended to promote marginal rather than more radical or systematic transformations.",0.30924225257958166,0.38611718596402295,0.14511069458934456,0.38620682273778817,0.10942418954600086,0.0824890981614815,0.1596080905827339
Women's differentiated vulnerability and adaptations to climate-related agricultural water scarcity in rural Central Vietnam,"This field-based study applies a mixed methods approach that combines both qualitative and quantitative analyses to investigate the differences in women's vulnerability and adaptations to climate-related agricultural water scarcity in Ky Nam commune, Central Vietnam. The study highlights the heterogeneity of women as a group and their intersectional dynamics as they adapt to increasing agricultural water scarcity on their rural livelihoods. The findings show that social differences including gender, class, household headship, age and stage of life shape women's differentiated experiences in vulnerability in access to water, to forestland and credit; in turn mark their adaptation differentiation to climate-related agricultural water scarcity. It also stresses that existing development policies can cause inequality in resource access in practice, running the risk of further marginalizing certain groups of women, especially female heads of household. Meanwhile, the current National Target Program to Respond to Climate Change of Vietnam is blind to issues of women's differentiated vulnerability and adaptive capacity. This study suggests that if these current development and adaptation measures do not pay proper attention to differentiated gender experience, it is likely to exacerbate the vulnerabilities of those affected, particularly female heads of household, rather than help them. In addition, these development and climate programmes have to be redesigned to accommodate more context-specific policies instead of one-size-fits-all packages that will effectively address women's (and men's) differential needs and unequal relations and circumstances.",0.7251703449732314,0.3298149123165099,0.09439370191396779,0.5461565447201413,0.05177405562004887,0.06221391755239571,0.31722832321148914
The Dynamic Multiscale Nature of Climate Change Vulnerability: An Inuit Harvesting Example,"This article advances a vulnerability framework to understand how climatic risks and change are experienced and responded to by Inuit harvesters using a case study from Iqaluit, Nunavut. The article makes important contributions to methodological design in vulnerability studies, emphasizing the importance of longitudinal study design, real-time observations of human-environment interactions, community-based monitoring, and mixed methods. Fieldwork spanned five years, during which sixty-four semistructured interviews were conducted and historical records examined to develop an understanding of the processes and conditions affecting vulnerability. A local land use monitoring team was established, collecting approximate to 22,000km of land use Global Positioning System (GPS) data and engaging in biweekly interviews (more than 100) on exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. This was complemented by analysis of instrumental data on sea ice and climate conditions. Results indicate that sea ice conditions are changing rapidly and affecting trail conditions, safety, and access to harvesting grounds. GPS data and biweekly interviews document real-time adaptations, with traditional knowledge and land-based skills, resource use flexibility, and mobility underpinning significant adaptability, including utilizing new areas, modifying trail routes, and taking advantage of an extended open water season. Sociospatial reorganization following resettlement in the 1950s and 1960s, however, has created dependency on external conditions, has reduced the flexibility of harvesting activities, and has affected knowledge systems. Within the context of these slow variables, current responses that are effective in moderating vulnerability could undermine adaptive capacity in the long term, representing overspecialized adaptations, creating the potential for further loss of response diversity and flexibility, and engendering potential downstream effects, creating trajectories of maladaptation. These findings challenge previous research that has argued that current resilience of the Inuit socioecological system is indicative of high adaptive capacity to future change and indicates that climate change might pose more serious risks to the harvesting sector than previously assumed.",0.6456340185426307,0.40243924802727715,0.19804016369860294,0.3984304924565832,0.09057252118395474,0.053641931389873235,0.12809925935473312
Is rainfall gradient a factor of livelihood diversification? Empirical evidence from around climatic hotspots in Indo-Gangetic Plains,"Farmers in the Indo-Gangetic Plains are constantly seeking ways to adapt to changing circumstances and opportunities that include new technologies, institutions, policies, socio-economic and cultural shifts, as well as a changing climate. The relationship between rainfall and local livelihoods is important to devise policies to improve adaptive capacity of farmers to different drivers of changes. The present study investigates whether the spatial variations in rainfall have prompted the location-specific livelihood diversification by using data from 2660 farm families in the climatic risk areas in India, Nepal and Bangladesh. The results show a higher on-farm livelihood diversification in the areas with high rainfall (1500-2100 mm) compared to medium (900-1500 mm) and very high rainfall regimes (> 2100 mm). Based on this study, the optimal range of rainfall for better agricultural livelihood in the context of changing environmental circumstances is from 1500 to 2100 mm. In terms of farm practices changed (proxy of adaptability), farmers responded more frequently to the market-related drivers than climatic stressors. Farmers in climate vulnerable areas (Bihar and coastal Bangladesh for instance) responded more to climatic stressors than those living in relatively less vulnerable areas (Terai for instance). The results imply that livelihood strategies should be tailor-made along the climatic resources such as rainfall, considering other biophysical and socio-economic variations at the spatial scale. Identifying household and farm-level coping strategies along the rainfall gradient can also be useful in targeting interventions to build resilience to shocks.",0.9039360862241799,0.25383208286553405,0.08498733778699963,0.6383507646590172,0.05300513546591522,0.015729601344303807,0.03135688601240883
Climate change perceptions and local adaptation strategies of hazard-prone rural households in Bangladesh,"Adaptation is a key strategy that can alleviate the severity of climate change impacts on agriculture and food production. Adaptation strategies are unlikely to be effective without an understanding of the farmers' perceptions of climate change. This paper explores the local knowledge of adaptation in response to the perceived impacts of climate change and climatic hazards using a survey of 380 resource-poor riverbank erosion-prone households in Bangladesh. The results indicate that the respondents' perceptions of changes in the climate and of extreme climatic events are similar to the observed climate data. Households have recognized the impacts on their livelihood and resources, resulting in an increased sense of vulnerability. To build resilience, households have undertaken a range of farming and non-farming adaptation strategies, which vary significantly among the farming groups. The important adaptation strategies include adopting new crop varieties, changing planting time, homestead gardening, planting trees and migration. Improved access to finance and to information about appropriate strategies appears to be crucial to support adaptation processes locally and thus to enhance the resilience of vulnerable households.

"Community-responsive adaptation to flooding in Kibera, Kenya","Much of the world's existing and future population will live in slums, where the twin trajectories of rapid urbanisation and increased flooding driven by climate change collide. Few spatial planning policies currently address this issue in practice. Poorly planned relocation from slum areas has caused conflict and insecurity, while large-scale infrastructural solutions for reducing flood risk are prohibitively expensive. There is a need to consider how local adaptation measures for increasing resilience to flooding can complement other structural and policy measures. This paper describes and evaluates autonomous, market-based and public-policy-driven structural and non-structural adaptation approaches to flooding in Kibera, the largest informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. The analysis employs a novel survey data set from 963 households in Kibera and extensive community and institutional stakeholder consultation. Results of the consultation demonstrate how autonomous adaptation at the household level is disincentivised by insecure housing tenure, while public-policy-driven approaches are constrained by the lack of effective community engagement. Combining the lessons from this analysis with 10 years of experience in developing public space and infrastructure projects in Kibera, the paper builds the case for an approach to 'community-responsive adaptation' to urban flooding that negotiates these limitations.",0.13813215091567901,0.38593759697180113,0.10695714230473034,0.3098310766355766,0.12027879429434096,0.5205565098797108,0.4531653587482476

"Pro-poor adaptation for the urban extreme poor in the context of climate change: A study on Dhaka City, Bangladesh","Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine pro-poor urban asset adaptation to climate variability and change. It constructs a conceptual framework that explores the appropriate asset adaptation strategies for extreme poor households as well as the process of supporting these households and groups in accumulating these assets. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative data are obtained from life histories, key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus-group discussions (FGDs). These data are collected, coded and themed. Findings This research identifies that households among the urban extreme poor do their best to adapt to perceived climate changes; however, in the absence of savings, and access to credit and insurance, they are forced to adopt adverse coping strategies. Individual adaptation practices yield minimal results and are short lived and even harmful because the urban extreme poor are excluded from formal policies and institutions as they lack formal rights and entitlements. For the poorest, the process of facilitating and maintaining patron-client relationships is a central coping strategy. Social policy approaches are found to be effective in facilitating asset adaptation for the urban extreme poor because they contribute to greater resilience to climate change. Originality/value This study analyses the empirical evidence through the lens of a pro-poor asset-adaptation framework. It shows that the asset-transfer approach is an effective in building household-adaptation strategies. Equally important is the capacity to participate in and influence the institutions from which these people have previously been excluded.",0.4860687211771109,0.3336443961332101,0.04741639174051706,0.6381939035754243,0.0586217636874202,0.2630865821733144,0.10501323645286831
"Climate change and declining levels of green structures: Life in informal settlements of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania","Impacts of climate change are often acute for those who live in informal settlements, the places where poverty, inequality and deprivation are concentrated in cities across the developing world. To broaden the strategies to address this issue, many cities are now embracing ecosystem-based adaptation and resilience. But, in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) the approach is yet to make much headway. This paper examines how climate change impacts on poor urban people via one component of urban ecosystem - urban green structures (UGS) - in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It examines: the UGS of importance to the city's informal dwellers and the range of derived services; changes over time to these UGS and derived services; and emerging adaptation practices. Using qualitative methods, the study has three key findings. First, cultural ecosystem services are of greatest importance to informal dwellers, although they do harness a range of other services. Second, the city's UGS have undergone dramatic changes due to both climatic and non-climatic factors. This has resulted in a gradual decline in the quantity and quality of UGS-derived services for the urban poor. Third, in responding to these changes, informal settlement dwellers have relied mostly on their personal, and sometimes on their collective, resources and capabilities. There are some innovative practices that draw on external institutions, but access to external support for informal communities has remained consistently low. City authorities should approach and plan greening 'for' (not 'in') informal settlements as a targeted environmental improvement endeavour - referred to here as 'creative urban planning'.",0.17068122696399435,0.35114545327812535,0.09804132322038425,0.3324811526918918,0.06358073110318878,0.5891808394415146,0.0967639156585963
"TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER IN CHIAPAS, MEXICO: RURAL WOMEN'S APPROACHES TO CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION","Climate change is a global phenomenon with effects that reverberate throughout the world at individual, local, and national scales. Individuals, communities, organizations, states, nations, and regions often have different capacities and strategies to adapt to changing environmental realities, and those nuanced experiences can contribute to a global conversation about climate change. Through semi-structured interviews with women in 2 local development organizations, La Red de Productores y Cosumidores Responsables Comida Sana y Cercana and Mujeres y Maiz, in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico, this paper analyzes local development programs and their contribution to climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies for members. I argue that the missions, visions, and practices of each organization are rooted in experience and knowledge of the past and present and alternative visions for the future. Specifically, the paper situates pathways to development created by local organizations into their socioeconomic context, discussing niche markets created by EZLN solidarity tourism, the implementation of NAFTA, and the cultural significance of both maize and the milpa.",0.3174801279671693,0.40637308449148285,0.1816954496961158,0.31971458352351134,0.05949774421952299,0.06096811055309647,0.10380916282709554
"Bamboo Beating Bandits: Conflict, Inequality, and Vulnerability in the Political Ecology of Climate Change Adaptation in Bangladesh","Bangladesh contributes little to global greenhouse gas emissions, yet it is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Based on semi-structured research interviews as a conduit to a literature review, this paper shows how the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment impede the vitality of its climate change adaptation efforts. Enclosure refers to when adaptation projects transfer public assets into private hands or expand the roles of private actors into the public sphere. Exclusion refers to when adaptation projects limit access to resources or marginalize particular stakeholders in decision-making activities. Encroachment refers to when adaptation projects intrude on bio-diversity areas or contribute to other forms of environmental degradation. Entrenchment refers to when adaptation projects aggravate the disempowerment of women and minorities, or worsen concentrations of wealth and income inequality within a community. In the case of Bangladeshi, climate change policies implemented under the country's National Adaptation Program of Action have enabled elites to capture land through public servants, the military, and even gangs carrying bamboo sticks. Exclusionary forms of adaptation planning exist at both the national and local scales. Climate protection measures have encroached upon village property, char (public) land, forests, farms, and other public commons. Most egregiously, community coping strategies for climate change have entrenched class and ethnic hierarchies ultimately trapping the poor, powerless, and displaced into a predatory patronage system that can aggravate human insecurity and intensify violent conflict. Planners and practitioners of adaptation need to become more cognizant of the potential for projects to harm others, or admit complicity in the processes of enclosure, exclusion, encroachment, and entrenchment, if they are ever to be eliminated.

"Perceptions of climate change impacts, adaptation and limits to adaption in the Australian Alps: the ski-tourism industry and key stakeholders","This paper explores perceptions of ski-tourism representatives and other regional stake-holders about climate change impacts, limits to tourism development and adaptation strategies in the Australian Alps. This area faces rising temperatures, declining rain and snow falls, and shorter skiing seasons. Open-ended interviews examined the perceptions, plans and attitudes of the ski industry and those of conservation managers, local government officials and Australian researchers into tourism and/or climate change effects in the Australian Alps. All interviewees accepted climate change was a reality; several, however, questioned the worst-case scenarios. The major tourism-related adaptation strategies were snowmaking and diversifying to year-round tourism; the success of these strategies will vary according to individual resorts' snowmaking capacity and potential summer tourism revenue. Currently non-snow-based tourism revenue is worth only approximately 30% of winter revenue. Social resistance to increased water and electricity use for snowmaking emerged as an important issue. Competition for water, including the needs of ecosystems, agriculture and fire protection in this summer-fire-prone region, and fire management issues, is a key concern. Current conflicts between the ski industry and other stakeholders over climate change adaptation call for a collaborative adaptation and change policy within the Australian Alps.",0.33404655126776145,0.3098416755511576,0.2224500973438024,0.35271634472162305,0.04880730538088769,0.055282011876578344,0.11018565265505884
Beyond local climate: rainfall variability as a determinant of household nonfarm activities in contemporary rural Burkina Faso,"At the household level, nonfarm activities are thought to help rural poor households buffer against agricultural risks related to local climate variability by providing them with cash to buy food in the case of harvest shortfalls. Over the recent decades, households in rural Sub-Sahara have been found less dependent on land and subsistence agriculture and an increasing number of households here derive their income from nonfarm activities. This study tests the hypothesis that rural households in Burkina Faso have diversified to the extent that they no longer rely on nonfarm activities as a safety net against adverse local rainfall events. Results show that household decisions to participate in the nonfarm economy could not be directly linked with local rainfall events during the study period in the mid-2000s. However, household participation was determined by adverse rainfall conditions in the major staple food production zone of the country, presumably because these caused a rise in food prices. Results also suggested that Burkinabe households adopted a flexible approach to nonfarm participation in terms of locality and plurality, depending on short-term rainfall conditions.",0.8975220282090455,0.27017059069616695,0.05514325791956247,0.6798474059202866,0.05080899569178773,0.02753447804458414,0.07562502829511035
Conflicts in adaptation: case studies from Nepal and the Maldives,"Purpose Adaptation appears to be regarded as a panacea in policy circles to reduce the risk of impending crises resulting from contemporary changes, including but not restricted to climate change. Such conceptions can be problematic, generally assuming adaptation as an entirely positive and non-conflictual process. The purpose of this paper is to challenge such uncritical views, drawing attention to the conflictual nature of adaptation, and propose a theoretical framework facilitating the identification and analysis of conflicts in adaptation. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on case study research using first-hand narratives of adaptation in Nepal and the Maldives collected using qualitative interviews, participant observation and document analysis. Findings The findings identify conflicts between actors in, and around, communities that are adapting to changes. These conflicts can be categorized along three dimensions: qualitative differences in the type of conflict, the relative position of conflicting actors and the degree of manifestation of the conflict. Originality/value The three-dimensional Adaptation Conflict Framework facilitate analysis of conflicts in adaptation, allowing for a critical examination of subjectivities inherent in the adaptation discourses embedded in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation research and policy.

Climate change knowledge and organizational adaptation: a destination management organization case study,"This paper reports on an exploratory empirical study that examined the extent of organizational adaptation of a destination to climate change. Utilizing a case study of a UK island destination, the paper focuses specifically on the way the destination management organization (DMO) acquires climate change knowledge and how it translates this knowledge into organizational learning and destination adaptation. The study identified a number of challenges facing the destination management organization, particularly in relation to leadership and destination governance. Further, although the DMO was engaged in few climate-related adaptation measures, it was evident that greater emphasis was placed on mitigation strategies.",0.3819593408080455,0.36868022470541223,0.13055508539239685,0.30685838604089566,0.09692377764818105,0.13520190851584044,0.13055287548946876
Farmers' Adaptation Strategies to Climate Change and Their Implications in the Zou Department of South Benin,"Climate change is a global phenomenon. Its impact on agricultural activities in developing countries has increased dramatically. Understanding how farmers perceive climate change and how they adapt to it is very important to the implementation of adequate policies for agricultural and food security. This paper aims to contribute to an understanding of farmers' adaptation choices, determinants of the adaptation choices and the long-term implications of the adaptation choices. Data were collected from 120 respondents in the Zou Department of Benin. A binary logit model was used to analyze the factors influencing household decisions to adapt to climate change. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was estimated to analyze the factors influencing households' choice of adaptation strategies to climate change. The results show that farmers have a developed perception of climate change. These changes are translated by rainfall disturbances (rainfall delays, early cessation, bad rainfall distribution etc.), shortening of the small dry season, increasing of temperature and sometimes, violent winds. The survey reveals that Benin farmers adopt many strategies in response to climate change. These strategies include ""Crop-livestock diversification and other good practices (mulching, organic fertilizer),"" ""Use of improved varieties, chemical fertilizers and pesticides,"" ""Agroforestry and perennial plantation and Diversification of income-generating activities."" The findings also reveal that most of the respondents use these strategies in combination. From the binary logit model, we know that farming experience and ""educational level of household head"" positively influence adaptation decisions. The result of the multinomial logit analysis shows that farming experience, educational level, farm size and gender have a significant impact on climate change adaptation strategies. Based on in-depth analysis of each strategy, we identify crop diversification and agroforestry as being the most promising strategies with benefits for farmers, the environment and future generations.",0.9798552709490405,0.16086112103254613,0.08925262727725394,0.6471622435577309,0.012128715816953932,0.012619112725033386,0.011726742434006576
Building resilience to food insecurity in rural communities: Evidence from traditional institutions in Zimbabwe,"Many rural communities that depend on smallholder farming face food insecurity induced by climate-related disasters. In response, some communities are taking the initiative to cope and adapt to climate-related disasters. Using case study material from the Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe, this article examines how traditional institutions are enhancing resilience to food insecurity in rural areas. The data were collected through interviews and focus groups involving traditional leaders, ward councillors, village civil protection members and villagers selected in the valley. The findings point to how the Zunde raMambo informal safety net, nhimbe form of collective work and the practice of share-rearing arrangement to access draught power help save lives and alleviate food insecurity induced by flood or drought disasters. The study concludes that the three schemes are evidence of community reorganisation or change in response to food insecurity. They are a form of absorptive capacities enabling the community to cope with food insecurity.",0.6472463337977785,0.43797751042589256,0.08977490159215876,0.5849763967394834,0.10082283826327834,0.06560120915497392,0.21678327042116619
RESILIENCE IN A MOUNTAIN RANGE: THE CASE OF THE TADRART ACACUS (SOUTHWEST LIBYA),"Between 2003-2011, a research programme in southwest Fazzan (Libya) aimed at understanding the resilience of the Kel Tadrart Tuareg, currently inhabiting the Acacus Mts. Using a multi-pronged approach featuring oral interviews, participant observation, mapping of settlements and localisation of natural resources, the Kel Tadrarts' interaction with the landscape was investigated, and traditional (local) ecological knowledge turned out to be a key factor in the successful adaptation of the Kel Tadrart to erratic rainfall and meagre pastures.

"Gender and Adaptation to Climate Change: Perspectives from a Pastoral Community in Gujarat, India","Adaptation of rural communities to climate change has garnered much attention recently. Within this body of knowledge, two omissions are notable: first, while adaptation and coping responses of agricultural communities to climate variability and extremes are discussed extensively in rural planning, pastoral and agro-pastoral communities are neglected, homogenized, or considered ancillary to sedentarized agriculture. The mechanisms used by these communities to confront socio-economic and institutional limitations to climate adaptation remain relatively unexamined. Second, not much is known about pastoral women's perceptions of climate adaptation and coping. This article examines the socially situated perspective of women in the Maldhari pastoral community in Gujarat, Western India. Findings reveal that climate adaptation pathways traditionally utilized by the Maldharis are constrained by the institutional, policy and social context in which the community is placed, with specific impacts on women. The lack of recourse to traditional adaptation pathways in the face of climate vulnerability triggers coping responses for survival, livelihoods and food security, which produce gendered burdens especially in terms of women's work. Local perspectives thus shed light on how constraints to climate adaptation impact women in marginalized pastoral communities.",0.6112442869732315,0.3762862048851832,0.12770284828534612,0.5196312530282736,0.0644355649800156,0.03114030768666413,0.1432142931384597
Household and community responses to impacts of climate change in the rural hills of Nepal,"The research was designed to answer how households and local communities in rural Nepal are responding to the impacts of climate change. Using four villages as case study units, a mixed method approach was adopted in a multi-scaled process carried out at community, district and national levels. The research found that adaptation practices being adopted differ according to household well-being and are largely governed by access to education, information and resources within the community. Responses such as livelihood and income diversification, internal migration, share cropping, taking consumption loans, use of alternative energy and use of bio-pesticides were found to mostly vary according to well-being status of the interviewees. Development of adaptation plans, strategies and support mechanisms should take account of the different adaptation practices and needs of households. If such individual situations are not considered, adaptation responses may be ineffective or even be maladaptive and increase vulnerability. The research also found that the autonomous, unplanned and reactive nature of adaptation practices chosen by rural communities can contribute to further inequity and unequal power relations. The knowledge generated from this research contributes to understanding of how climate change contributes to vulnerability, but also how local practices and lack of an effective climate policy or response measures may magnify the effects of many existing drivers of vulnerability in terms of maladaptation and increasing social inequalities.",0.49295841970736537,0.46756717192941716,0.1123252402339522,0.5,0.11128061906563218,0.07103148480150479,0.0747895818982753
"Climate change knowledge, concerns, and behaviors among Caribbean fishers","The Caribbean, as a collection of Small Island Developing States, has been a hotspot for climate change research. Many studies have examined the consequences of climate change. However, few studies have examined the ways in which marginalized groups in the Caribbean view climate change. What are the levels of knowledge, concerns, and behavioral practices among marginalized groups in the Caribbean? This paper begins to explore this question using Caribbean fishers as a case study. The survey study of 241 fishers is done in one of the largest fish-landing sites in Jamaica. Fishers are asked about levels of knowledge about causes of climate change, concerns and the consequences, and actual adaptation behaviors. Using descriptive and inferential statistical tests, the paper explores the actual levels of knowledge, concerns, and specific strategies used to adapt. However, its goes further by examining the factors that drive the aforementioned variables. This study begins to not only contribute to the environmental psychological literature on the Caribbean, but it also helps to better understand ways in which marginalized communities might be assisted in the adaptation to climate change. © 2017, AESS.",0.5360554150100074,0.41648175366127027,0.11849542489813114,0.4235009112587162,0.18763568532173663,0.09903890880405658,0.17385152672707152
Heading for the hills: climate-driven community relocations in the Solomon Islands and Alaska provide insight for a 1.5 °C future,"Whilst future air temperature thresholds have become the centrepiece of international climate negotiations, even the most ambitious target of 1.5 °C will result in significant sea-level rise and associated impacts on human populations globally. Of additional concern in Arctic regions is declining sea ice and warming permafrost which can increasingly expose coastal areas to erosion particularly through exposure to wave action due to storm activity. Regional variability over the past two decades provides insight into the coastal and human responses to anticipated future rates of sea-level rise under 1.5 °C scenarios. Exceeding 1.5 °C will generate sea-level rise scenarios beyond that currently experienced and substantially increase the proportion of the global population impacted. Despite these dire challenges, there has been limited analysis of how, where and why communities will relocate inland in response. Here, we present case studies of local responses to coastal erosion driven by sea-level rise and warming in remote indigenous communities of the Solomon Islands and Alaska, USA, respectively. In both the Solomon Islands and the USA, there is no national government agency that has the organisational and technical capacity and resources to facilitate a community-wide relocation. In the Solomon Islands, communities have been able to draw on flexible land tenure regimes to rapidly adapt to coastal erosion through relocations. These relocations have led to ad hoc fragmentation of communities into smaller hamlets. Government-supported relocation initiatives in both countries have been less successful in the short term due to limitations of land tenure, lacking relocation governance framework, financial support and complex planning processes. These experiences from the Solomon Islands and USA demonstrate the urgent need to create a relocation governance framework that protects people’s human rights. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",0.12253548144251944,0.4621874235903852,0.1109440081151199,0.2566636676031989,0.594068577730131,0.46047424863073083,0.21343044147484444
Assessing adaptive capacity and adaptation: insights from Samoan tourism operators,"Many of the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are known to be very vulnerable to climate change impacts. This is particularly so where national economies are highly dependent on tourism-related revenue. Yet, little is known of the adaptive capacities of tourism providers in SIDS and how they respond to climate variability and change. This research uses a case study of Samoa, a Pacific island nation, that is highly dependent on beach tourism and already vulnerable to a variety of natural hazards. The research examines the adaptive capacity of tourism operators in Samoa and the ways in which Faasamoa (the Samoan way of life) is a fundamental part of how tourism operators plan for and respond to climate variability and extremes. The findings indicate that key components of adaptive capacity for Samoan tourism operators include their past experiences of extreme events, access to resources, social networks, and worldviews. In many cases, Samoan cultural values and socio-cultural governance systems play a critical role in how adaptation takes place. In the Samoan context, this means that an indigenous Samoan tourism operator is rarely one individual, but a part of a wider social network, which influences how a business can or cannot adapt to climate variability and change and hazards.",0.1698373587335143,0.43044176009027835,0.19634734735807816,0.45109496147876366,0.16878478051188267,0.04431557798764569,0.15044561998177047

Marine dependent livelihoods and resilience to environmental change: A case study of Anguilla,"There is increasing concern over the consequences of environmental change for people and communities that depend on already fragile marine resources, given the mounting evidence of sustained over-exploitation and climate change impacts on marine systems. In order to explore the potential social resilience of marine-dependent livelihoods to environmental change, interviews with fishers and marine-based tourism operators in the Caribbean island of Anguilla were undertaken, to identify the impacts of hurricane events on marine livelihoods, the perceptions of resource-users and their potential adaptability to future change. For both sectors of resource-users, there is evidence that they have diversified livelihoods to achieve financial security, which may provide resilience to future climate related impacts or resource variability. In addition, specific behavioural changes that have been developed following previous hurricane events, e.g. removal of fish pots during hurricane months, or bringing boats to shore, indicate fishers' flexibility to changing conditions. However, strong personal and cultural attachment to occupations, particularly among fishers, may hinder resilience. Additionally, the reliance of all of these marine resource-users on the climate-dependent tourism industry may under-mine their capacity to cope with future environmental change. Many of these problems are common throughout the Caribbean, as thousands of marine-dependent livelihoods are vulnerable to marine degradation and climate change impacts. Urgent attention is therefore required to support the development of adaptive, sustainable management of marine resources that may enhance resilience to environmental change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Beyond 1.5 degrees C: vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies for Caribbean Small Island Developing States,"Global warming of 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels and a commensurate increase in global greenhouse gas emissions pose an unprecedented danger to human settlements, livelihoods and the sustainable development of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), yet these challenges present tremendous opportunities to rethink development pathways. The paper has two objectives. One is to critically review present vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies employed by the state, private sector, non-governmental organisations, community-based organisations and households. The other is to discuss vulnerabilities and identify adaptation and resiliency strategies which are considered most applicable beyond the 1.5 degrees C limit. The Caribbean Region is the focus of the paper. A key finding of the paper is that temperature change above the 1.5 degrees C limit set by the Paris Conference of the Parties will make the natural and human systems of SIDS even more highly vulnerable than they are already. Another finding is that Caribbean states have implemented various innovative climate change adaptation strategies, but their relevance should the 1.5 degrees C target be exceeded, requires further exploration. The paper is useful to policymakers, decision-makers and finance agencies in search of practical solutions to avert the implications for Caribbean settlements, economies and ecosystems should the temperature warming exceed 1.5 degrees C.",0.4589811507123662,0.3788214517843258,0.13588889047971692,0.42791992390546363,0.19224184368495004,0.1558431820048295,0.2090294363093459
The Role of Traditional Knowledge in Building Adaptive Capacity for Climate Change: Perspectives from Vanuatu,"There is increasing recognition of traditional knowledge as an important store of information and practices for building adaptive capacity for climate change in the Pacific. However, empirical research and documentation of how Pacific Islanders experience climate change, identify relevant adaptation options, and mobilize their adaptive capacity, including traditional knowledge, remains limited. Given this context, indigenous islander perspectives on traditional knowledge and its role in building their adaptive capacity are examined in this article. The author draws on research with the Nakanamanga-speaking peoples of Tongoa Island, Vanuatu. This research documents traditional knowledge relating to weather and climate observations; resource use and management; social networks; local leadership; and values and beliefs in these indigenous communities and reveals differing perspectives about its potential to enhance local adaptive capacity. It highlights indigenous concerns about self-reliance, cultural continuity, and how the transition to a cash economy, the valorization of Western education and lifestyles, and rural-urban migration have had adverse implications for traditional knowledge and its retention. It further reveals potential trade-offs for indigenous communities on Tongoa Island, where traditional governance, tenure systems, and values enable flexibility and collective action that build adaptive capacity but can also promote conservative attitudes and limit uptake of new information and practices.",0.4895964610356111,0.48884582217424166,0.19814052904343654,0.3674332031398125,0.2550378826772325,0.051039955638279,0.19319365554537365
Disaster management and climate change adaptation: a remote island perspective,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a perspective on disaster management and climate change adaptation often left out of the literature that of a remote outer island in Fiji. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative fieldwork was conducted on a small, remote island in the north of Fiji, during 2012. Interviews with community members on this island looked at their experiences and perceptions of disaster response and aid, and their expectations for the future. The perspectives of government and aid organisations involved in disaster response were compared with the remote community views. Findings - There is a prevalent view in Fiji of communities as having very high expectations of disaster relief aid, and being dependent on it. However, on a remote island where the community counts the wait for help in weeks rather than days, such expectations and dependence must be viewed in a different light. There is much to be learned from the resilience and self-help these communities have no choice but to exhibit. Originality/value - This paper helps to fill a gap in the disaster and climate change adaptation literature, by providing some insight into the experiences and perceptions of a remote outer island community, within the remote small island developing state of Fiji.",0.18390513249273602,0.5360277798367552,0.13763145522593156,0.3970232246054026,0.4790251219604939,0.09450067693553678,0.45050115738918406
Regional organisations and climate change adaptation in small island developing states,"Regional organisations play a central role in coordinating regional climate change adaptation responses across small island developing states, 58 countries that are particularly vulnerable to climate change and its impacts. The effectiveness of these organisations in coordinating adaptation efforts is underexplored in the academic literature, and this paper helps to fill the gap. By developing the Framework for Assessing Regional Organisations Coordinating Climate Change Adaptation, it qualitatively assesses the adaptation-related inputs, projects/programmes and outputs of the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme. This assessment is enriched by data gathered through interviews with national and regional climate change and development officials in the Caribbean and Pacific. It finds that regional organisations are more effective with respect to their adaptation-related inputs and outputs, but are less effective in coordinating adaptation projects/programmes. It recommends that, in addition to differentiating organisational mandates, regional organisations should focus on resolving the major climate-related information deficit issues, helping countries to develop ready to finance investment projects, building national-level capacities to adapt and supporting the creation of an enabling environment for climate change adaptation.",0.27417674815539245,0.4504756255490439,0.25020592721587936,0.3452348448605683,0.22409920833610283,0.11868945204648068,0.1283713993401362
Adapting to climate change at the national level in Caribbean small island developing states,"Small island developing states (SIDS) are distinct from other developing countries: they are particularly and comparatively more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Efforts to understand national-level vulnerability in these countries are limited. This paper helps to fill this gap and has two main aims. First, it identifies trends in national-level climate change adaptation among SIDS in the Caribbean region. Second, it identifies the limits to adaptation at the national level in these countries. In applying a resilience lens, and using summative content analysis techniques and semi-structured interviews with 26 senior policy-makers, this paper finds that Caribbean SIDS are primarily adapting to changes in hurricane, rainfall, and drought patterns. It also finds that most adaptations are being undertaken in the coastal zone and the water and agriculture sectors, and that there are many factors limiting national-level adaptation. The most commonly reported limit is financing, though not all policy-makers agree that financing is a limit. These findings are important for national SIDS governments and international donors and agencies that will be better able to identify and fill gaps in their adaptation actions and financing. This paper's findings also highlight the importance of depoliticising climate change and prioritising good governance, improving SIDS' access to international adaptation financing, and making the road to a climate-resilient future by walking.",0.36326216747474643,0.3852850729461976,0.1552725390497063,0.40120067187264896,0.2734139970496518,0.16104633430024584,0.37919466939075647
Agrarian change and the development of the greenhouse farming sector in Jamaica,"The simultaneous impacts of climatic and economic changes have increased the vulnerability of small-scale farmers in the Caribbean. New technologies to improve the control farmers have over their production milieu have become a central feature of programmes for rural development and strategies devised by farmers themselves. Regionally, greenhouses have become the most distinctive in-novation, introduced to enhance the resilience of farmers to increasingly capricious realities. Greenhouses enable greater efficiency in the management of scarce water resources and allow increased regulation of the conditions under which crops are cultivated. This paper reviews the development of the greenhouse farming industry in Jamaica. The research is based on data collected in 2014 from more than 100 semi-structured interviews with farmers, higglers, extension agents and government officials. The article draws specifically on 30 interviews with members of the Jamaica Greenhouse Grower's Association and consultants who have been engaged in government and donor agency development projects. The public statements of government and aid agency officials,project reports and other official documents are also considered. The introduction of greenhouses into Jamaican farming is changing the production and marketing dynamic and the agro-ecologi-cal dimensions of farming, and has implications for food security and resilience. © 2017 University of the West Indies.

Can Perceptions of Environmental and Climate Change in Island Communities Assist in Adaptation Planning Locally?,"Local perceptions of environmental and climate change, as well as associated adaptations made by local populations, are fundamental for designing comprehensive and inclusive mitigation and adaptation plans both locally and nationally. In this paper, we analyze people's perceptions of environmental and climate-related transformations in communities across the Western Solomon Islands through ethnographic and geospatial methods. Specifically, we documented people's observed changes over the past decades across various environmental domains, and for each change, we asked respondents to identify the causes, timing, and people's adaptive responses. We also incorporated this information into a geographical information system database to produce broad-scale base maps of local perceptions of environmental change. Results suggest that people detected changes that tended to be acute (e.g., water clarity, logging intensity, and agricultural diseases). We inferred from these results that most local observations of and adaptations to change were related to parts of environment/ecosystem that are most directly or indirectly related to harvesting strategies. On the other hand, people were less aware of slower insidious/chronic changes identified by scientific studies. For the Solomon Islands and similar contexts in the insular tropics, a broader anticipatory adaptation planning strategy to climate change should include a mix of local scientific studies and local observations of ongoing ecological changes.",0.5225144823283632,0.3662552828245628,0.17682616829366027,0.347867813152589,0.07182633510126532,0.05819006731344298,0.20515184364544142
"Multiple stressors impacting a small island tourism destination-community: A nested vulnerability assessment of Oistins, Barbados","Small island nations face several challenges, both short-and long-term, in the context of a changing climate and socio-economic environments. Consequently, their communities are vulnerable to multiple sources of stress. This study examines the multiple stressors impacting a tourism community, based on 48 interviews and five focus groups, with local and national stakeholders in Oistins, Barbados. The research identifies mechanisms used by respondents to cope and adapt to change and finds that many are short-term oriented, and so under-estimate the potential of long-term climatic change. Moreover, responses to change are often ineffective. A nested analysis indicates important relationships between factors external to Barbados, those inherent to the island, and then those specific to the community. The paper concludes with the suggestion that sectoral and community-level adaptations are not always consistent and/or appropriate and that local stakeholder adaptation is not fully effective in reducing tourism vulnerability.",0.3100320918877964,0.4386132725851222,0.1617672792185149,0.4585461556958907,0.14071662326294992,0.04328422444432575,0.25426660055751826
"Tropical cyclone perceptions, impacts and adaptation in the Southwest Pacific: an urban perspective from Fiji, Vanuatu and Tonga","The destruction caused by tropical cyclone (TC) Pam in March 2015 is considered one of the worst natural disasters in the history of Vanuatu. It has highlighted the need for a better understanding of TC impacts and adaptation in the Southwest Pacific (SWP) region. Therefore, the key aims of this study are to (i) understand local perceptions of TC activity, (ii) investigate impacts of TC activity and (iii) uncover adaptation strategies used to offset the impacts of TCs. To address these aims, a survey (with 130 participants from urban areas) was conducted across three SWP small island states (SISs): Fiji, Vanuatu and Tonga (FVT). It was found that respondents generally had a high level of risk perception and awareness of TCs and the associated physical impacts, but lacked an understanding of the underlying weather conditions. Responses highlighted that current methods of adaptation generally occur at the local level, immediately prior to a TC event (preparation of property, gathering of food, finding a safe place to shelter). However higher level adaptation measures (such as the modification to building structures) may reduce vulnerability further. Finally, we discuss the potential of utilising weather-related traditional knowledge and non-traditional knowledge of empirical and climate-model-based weather forecasts to improve TC outlooks, which would ultimately reduce vulnerability and increase adaptive capacity. Importantly, lessons learned from this study may result in the modification and/ or development of existing adaptation strategies.",0.5408340439688084,0.417655550838159,0.12114267692521032,0.3453029797031015,0.16958419484489798,0.1379046855489771,0.12510656474903317
"Local perceptions of climate change impacts and migration patterns in Male, Maldives","For the last few decades, Maldives has been seen as being at the forefront of addressing climate change impacts. The low elevation of the islands makes them vulnerable to slow-onset hazards, such as coastal erosion, sea-level rise, salinity intrusion, and change in monsoon patterns and hence rainfall. Consequently, migration has long been discussed as an adaptation strategy for the population. This study covers outcomes from our field research conducted among islanders in Male, the capital of Maldives, in 2013. It contributes empirical evidence toward understanding complex relations among environmental challenges, climate change, and migration. We set up two main research questions. The first question explored islanders' perceptions of impacts of climatic variability in recent years and possible impacts of future climate change. The second question probed whether out-migration from the islands might be considered to be an adaptation strategy and whether the islanders were willing to move outside Maldives due to projected climate change impacts. We conducted our field research in the capital Male and nearby residential islands, using quantitative questionnaires with local respondents (N=347). Our results suggest that, besides a set of actually experienced environmental and climate challenges, slow-onset climate change impacts such as sea-level rise are perceived as being one of the key factors affecting Maldivian society and livelihoods. More than 50% of respondents perceive future sea-level rise to be a serious challenge at the national level and they accept that migration from islands to other countries might be a potential option. Conversely, from the individual perspective, sea-level rise is not perceived by the local population as being one of their own important challenges. The reason is that many other factors - cultural, religious, economic and social - play an important role in decisionmaking about migrating or not.",0.276539060945884,0.4010438805422667,0.09864690587683783,0.3428873866483951,0.37756114192289325,0.198670814866513,0.06517967221089357
Climate adaptation strategies in Fiji: The role of social norms and cultural values,"The Fiji Islands in the South Pacific are highly exposed to climate-induced hazards and have experienced several flood and cyclone events in recent years. Drawing on a series of field studies in the lower Ba River Catchment on Fiji's main island Viti Levu, the objective of this paper is to determine how climate adaptation strategies - employed by indigenous Fijian communities and households - are influenced by socio-cultural values and access to resources, information and power. Our multi-method approach has been conceptually informed by Agrawal and Perrin's (2008) climate adaptation framework and included semi-structured interviews at the household level, and participatory hazard mapping with diverse focus groups at the community level. Our study finds that due to diverse value-based assessments of livelihood opportunities and climate-related risks, communal and household adaptive strategies can differ widely, even in a very localized cultural context. We also show how decisions to relocate from 'risky environments' are influenced by a combination of local power relations, attachment to cultural and social space, and the provision of external assistance. Our findings comment on the need for disaster risk reduction strategies to recognize how different groups and households respond to climate-related events in distinct socially determined ways.

Adaptation to Climate Change in Small Island Developing States: A Systematic Literature Review of Academic Research,"Small Island Developing States (SIDS) share a common vulnerability to climate change. Adaptation to climate change and variability is urgently needed yet, while some is already occurring in SIDS, research on the nature and efficacy of adaptation across SIDS is fragmentary. In this article, we systematically review academic literature to identify where adaptation in SIDS is documented; what type of adaptation strategies are taken, and in response to which climate change impacts; and the extent to which this adaptation has been judged as successful. Our analysis indicates that much adaptation research is concentrated on the Pacific, on independent island states, and on core areas within SIDS. Research documents a wide array of adaptation strategies across SIDS, notably structural or physical and behavioral changes. Yet, evaluation of concrete adaptation interventions is lacking; it thus remains unclear to what extent documented adaptation effectively and sustainably reduces SIDS' vulnerability and increases their resilience.",0.4775559830617476,0.43909318414065646,0.22058261933227932,0.44327082271010315,0.3302880212181872,0.16630611022718875,0.2414348922243774
Adapting to climate change in small island developing states,"Small island developing states (SIDS) are among the first and worst affected by climate change. SIDS are thus also among the first to adapt, and as 'early adaptors' can provide key lessons for adaptation efforts elsewhere. This article reviews the growing literature on climate change, adaptation and small island states. It first discusses migration - which increasingly is seen as part of adaptation rather than a failure to adapt. Mobility has long been part of island life, and remittances can for example fund adaptation measures back home. Yet, adaptation in situ is not as forthcoming as would be necessary. The article identifies different barriers to effective adaptation, and discusses them under three distinct but interrelated categories: perceptions and awareness, institutions, and (lack of) resources. For effective, sustainable and successful adaptation, we need to overcome these barriers, and in particular provide information and resources to the local level. With appropriate information and resources, island communities can take and implement informed decisions and successfully adapt to a changing climate - as they have adjusted to social and environmental changes in the past.",0.3627473925067678,0.45681843657182303,0.15774241846909526,0.3881109656684892,0.24567560350128306,0.1784052988362208,0.25456923153853417
Community-based adaptation in low-lying islands in the Philippines: challenges and lessons learned,"Community-based adaptation (CBA) seeks to address climate risks and socio-economic drivers of vulnerability simultaneously. However, as CBA activities appear very similar to standard development work, difficulties in identifying good practices arise. To clarify the role of CBA, this study elucidated how climate change can impact pre-existing development problems by investigating the experiences of four low-lying island communities in central Philippines. The islands currently suffer from frequent and extreme tidal flooding (following an earthquake-induced land subsidence in 2013, with a magnitude that is broadly similar to sea-level rise projections under a 1.5 to 2 degrees C global warming scenario), and endured a dry spell in 2016. The study also identified various publicly and privately initiated adaptation strategies, and evaluated their resilience against actual biophysical events. The study conducted focus group discussions with local leaders and in-depth interviews with government officials and residents in March 2016. Results show that tidal flooding impacted almost all aspects of daily life on the islands, while the dry spell completely depleted their limited water supplies. The strategies implemented by governments and NGOs (e.g., seawalls, rainwater collectors) were found to be inadequate in preventing tidal flooding and compensating for the dry spell. Also, communities used coral stones and plastic waste for raising the floors of their homes, which have an erosive effect on their capacity to adapt in the long term. Lack of community participation in publicly initiated projects and lack of adaptation funding for community-based strategies were the greatest obstacles to implementing climate-resilient solutions.",0.46244136436360045,0.4320161239350184,0.11507412101967464,0.40492488966997464,0.12023517458050541,0.14110859191135505,0.2708303546733138
Climate Change Adaptation and Restoration of Western Trout Streams: Opportunities and Strategies,"Climate change is contributing to the severity and rate of stream degradation by changing the timing of peak flows, altering flow regimes, creating more frequent and intense disturbances, and increasing stream temperatures. Herein we describe three case studies of trout stream adaptation that address existing and climate-driven causes of degradation through habitat restoration. The case studies vary in geography and complexity, but all include restoration efforts intended to address multiple causes of stream degradation and improve the resilience of these streams to floods, droughts, and wildfires. Four elements of successful climate adaptation projects emerge: (1) habitat assessments that help drive project location and design, (2) projects that directly address climate change impacts and increase habitat resilience, (3) projects that combine to achieve watershed-scale impacts, and (4) projects that include sufficient monitoring to determine their effectiveness. We describe solutions to common challenges in conducting climate change adaptation, including how to balance scientific assessments with opportunities when choosing projects, how smaller projects can be aggregated to achieve watershed-scale benefits, and how citizen science efforts can augment monitoring programs. El cambio climatico esta contribuyendo a incrementar la severidad y la tasa de degradacion de los rios a traves de la alteracion en la estacionalidad del flujo maximo, modificacion del regimen de flujos, generacion de perturbaciones mas frecuentes e intensas e incremento de la temperatura de los rios. Aqui se describen tres casos de estudio de la adaptacion de rios en donde habita la trucha, en los que se abordan las causas de la degradacion que son provocadas por el cambio climatico, mediante la restauracion del habitat. Los casos de estudio varian en cuanto a ubicacion geografica y complejidad, pero en todos se contemplan esfuerzos de restauracion enfocados a abordar multiples causas de degradacion de rios y mejoramiento de la resiliencia de estos ante inundaciones, sequias e incendios naturales. Se consideraron cuatro elementos para lograr una adaptacion exitosa al cambio climatico: 1) evaluaciones del habitat que ayuden a disenar y establecer donde llevar a cabo los proyectos; 2) proyectos que aborden directamente los impactos del cambio climatico y el incremento en la resiliencia del habitat; 3) proyectos que, al combinarse, logren resultados a nivel de cuenca hidrologica; y 4) proyectos que incluyan un monitoreo suficiente como para que se pueda determinar su efectividad.

How is adaptation to climate change reflected in current practice of forest management and conservation? A case study from Germany,"Climate change is expected to challenge forest management and nature conservation in forests. Besides forest species, strategies and references for management and conservation will be affected. In this paper, we qualitatively analysed whether forest conservation and management practice have already adapted to the impacts of climate change and to what extent those practices reflect the adaptation strategies dealt with in international peer-reviewed literature. To this end, we conducted thirteen in-depth interviews with forest practitioners (forest officers/forest district officers) in four regions in Germany. The interview regions were selected to represent the variation in tree species composition, forest ownership regimes and vulnerability to climate change. Although interviewees claimed to take climate change and adaptation strategies into account, in practice such strategies have as yet only occasionally been implemented. Our results suggest that strategies for adapting forest management to climate change are just in the early stages of development or supplement existing strategies relating to general risk reduction or nature-orientated forest management. The extent to which climate change adaptation strategies have influenced overall management varies. This variation and the lack of specific strategies also reflect the existing uncertainties about future changes in climate and about the capacity of forest ecosystems to adapt. We conclude that, in the face of climate change, forest management will have a major influence on future biodiversity composition of forest ecosystems. Hence, a framework for conservation in forests providing recommendations which also take into account the consequences of climate change needs to be developed.",0.5224479928887944,0.2793761067686613,0.40187544360902944,0.2529238647948338,0.0465962365965856,0.032464732334831554,0.029576218685749504
Beguiling and risky: 'environmental works and measures' for wetland conservation under a changing climate,"In Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, small-scale engineering works called 'environmental works and measures' have been implemented as a basis for river and other wetland conservation. While implementing these, governments seem to have embraced the beguiling notion that scarce water supplies can be divided further, while conserving the environment and maintaining agricultural production. The difficulties in doing this are expected to increase in the face of extreme climate variability. With this scenario as a backdrop, the $280 million (Monetary values ($) in this paper are in Australian dollars (AUD). At the time of writing AUD $1.00 = similar to USD $1.02.) Living Murray and related programmes are assessed to see whether microengineering works to manage the hydrology of wetlands make for effective adaptation to water scarcity and climate change or whether it amounts to an overly narrow adaptation or maladaptation. Some measures were found to be substantially beneficial, such as the construction of fishways. However, under these programmes, only 0.6% of the Basin's wetlands would be inundated and there are significant risks including desiccation of nontarget wetlands and further reductions in water allocations for the environment. It is recommended that trade-offs between alternative strategies are assessed as the basis for minimising perverse impacts under changing climatic and hydrological conditions.",0.4388156552375755,0.2779080600004923,0.13168976234939075,0.20503980364182176,0.06669591966581193,0.1826661979797019,0.30908759813115017
Governing adaptation across scales: Hotspots and hesitancy in Pacific Northwest forests,"The observed and anticipated impacts of climate change interacting with the responses of actors and institutions to these changes are together poised to transform and reconfigure resource management systems across scales. Within many if not most resource management agencies, the number of programs and initiatives designed to adapt to the expected impacts of climate change has risen sharply over the past decade. This article examines the implementation of such climate adaptation initiatives in the context of the United States Forest Service (USFS). Based on semi-structured interviews (N = 25), this paper provides an empirical account of how USFS aquatic resources managers and specialists working at regional and sub-regional levels within the Pacific Northwest region (PNW) are responding to adaptation planning directives established at the federal level, as well as how managers are advancing their own unit-level initiatives. Results illustrate a spectrum of engagement with adaptation across the region. In addition to the expected influence of limited human and financial capacity and institutional constraints, key factors perceived by managers as shaping engagement across the region include the attitudes of key actors, and legacies of (mis-) trust (with respect to the stability of the climate mandate). In contrast, managers did not perceive technical information as a major barrier to adaptation. These observations highlight the asymmetry between the widespread emphasis on the role of technical information in shaping adaptation relative to the often overlooked, but influential role of nonmaterial factors (like attitudes and trust). Findings are discussed in the context of deepening understanding about the interrelated roles of material and nonmaterial barriers in shaping currently unfolding adaptation efforts.

PERCEPTION AND RESILIENCE OF ANDEAN POPULATIONS FACING CLIMATE CHANGE,"The Andean Tropics are among the mountain systems most affected by climate change. The most conspicuous effect is glacier recession. However, little is known about how rural populations perceive climatic change impacts or about how social-ecological systems respond to the effects of change. Here, I examine perceptions of climatic change and their effects on social-ecological systems in the Peruvian Southern Andes. Data from interviews and focus groups are used to explain institutional responses to climatic variability based upon perceived effects of climate change. Results show that people perceive glaciers shrinking, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, more extreme temperatures, and shortened rainy seasons. Their responses to these perceived changes range from wetland creation to agriculture calendar modification to irrigation adjustments. Such perceptions of change rely on personal observations and local knowledge, which inform responses; knowledge-based action characterizes resilient systems. This case study supports the conclusion that the resilience of social-ecological systems in the Peruvian Southern Andes is based upon local knowledge and institutions. Thus, strengthening institutions and fostering local knowledge renewal are crucial for systems' sustainability or transformation.",0.7716784239500937,0.35139256405372477,0.13878774351729556,0.39463892557404234,0.07937988035882697,0.017287855249284823,0.06671369579248376
"Vulnerability to Freshwater Changes in the Inuit Settlement Region of Nunatsiavut, Labrador: A Case Study from Rigolet","Drawing on vulnerability approaches from the climate change literature, this paper explores the vulnerability of residents of the community of Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Labrador, to changes in freshwater. Our approach emphasizes local preferences and values. We analyze the results from 89 household interviews (88% response) and targeted interviews in Rigolet to consider the human experience of climate variability and change. Residents report that changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of freshwater are currently challenging their ability to access preferred drinking water and food sources and are adding to the financial barriers that restrict their time spent on the land. The results of our study suggest that Rigolet residents are successfully adapting to existing freshwater changes in their watershed, though these adaptations have not come without sacrifice. The adaptive capacity of Rigolet residents has been supported by resource flexibility and experience-based knowledge of freshwater variability within their watershed, among other factors. Findings suggest that the exposure of sub-Arctic and Arctic communities to freshwater changes and their capacity to adapt are largely shaped by the lifeways of residents and the manner and degree to which they are dependent on local freshwater systems.",0.5360307776694694,0.3638402911516171,0.15017090246529108,0.4425171253412008,0.1612645323533078,0.10159435386243493,0.2791010678387251
"Climate Change, Water Practices and Relational Worlds in the Andes","Climate change translates into insecure water provision and produces new uncertainties for farmers and politicians in Colca Valley, Southern Peru. Anthropological studies of climate change have mainly focused on adaptation, resilience and so-called indigenous traditional knowledge. This article argues that a stronger ethnographic focus on material practices - including knowledge practices - can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of climate change effects, responses and forms of water management. The author aims to see responses to climate change as more than cultural representations, and therefore focuses on water practices and the realities that these practices make, as well as the relational webs of humans, environment, infrastructure and other-than-human beings. The article explores different practices that enact multiple versions of water, and multiple - yet related and entangled - water worlds. The author suggests that this has implications for how we understand politics of climate and water: as tensions between singularizing practices and multiplicity.",0.777830922368279,0.2691186669839853,0.2041033511952411,0.28618762064396314,0.05508674908523166,0.061093486857898595,0.7605181489128248
How local water and waterbody meanings shape flood risk perception and risk management preferences,"The sharp end of climate change is being, and will continue to be, experienced at the local and personal scale. How changing patterns of hazards interplay with local landscapes is an important focus of risk management, both in understanding how place-based risk is perceived and in identifying how local populations would like these risks to be managed. In this study we focus on the object of hazard and examine how different meanings associated with water and waterbodies relate to flood risk perception and preferences for flood management strategies. We present analysis of a mixed methods study with survey data (n=707) of residents in four coastal towns in France, South Africa and UK presented alongside an in-depth study of the two French towns (semi-structured interviews n=15 and document analysis). Our analysis unpacks the significance of relationships between the meaning of water in general, and the meaning of specific water bodies, to flood risk perceptions. Our findings indicate that general water meaning is more reliably related to flood risk perception than specific waterbody meaning, where waterbody meanings are significant for flood risk perception, positive identification with rivers relates to reduced flood risk perception. We also find that the meanings associated with water and waterbodies relate to specific preferences for different types of flood management, including insurance and local taxation. The implications for landscapes undergoing rapid change, for example as a result of changing climate and hydrological regimes, are discussed. In particular, we highlight how infrastructure interacts with sense of place in communities undergoing rapid social-ecological change and how understanding this interplay can help in the design of more fully supported adaptation strategies.",0.15849905542492615,0.3562481411472686,0.1734401680180032,0.12528569323544064,0.16411110638109985,0.4165336600290574,0.5724836554531211
"Coping with Drought: Perceptions, Intentions and Decision-Stages of South West England Households","As water supply in England increasingly faces threats of climate change, urbanisation and population growth, there is an imperative for household water users to be more resilient to extremes such as drought. However, since English water users have not traditionally been involved in drought management, there is need for in-depth understanding of perceptions and intentions towards drought management at a household scale to inform policy approaches. This paper fills this gap by investigating the perceptions and intentions of South West England households towards drought and drought coping. A theoretical framework developed through the lens of protection motivation theory and applying the trans-theoretical model, formed the basis of analysis of a survey administered in two communities in Exeter, England. Results indicated that despite low perceived likelihood and consequences of drought in their local area, participants were willing to implement household drought coping measures. Cluster analyses using a k-means clustering algorithm, found that participants were generally segmented in two typologies at different decision-stages. These decision-stages were defined by the variables perceived drought consequence, coping response efficacy, and behavioural intentions. Decision-stages were identified as contemplative and responsive decision-stages, illustrating willingness and participation in drought coping response at the household level. The importance of applying these psychological paradigms holds value for application in water company market research and policy decision-making in the context of targeted intervention strategies aimed at engendering drought resilient households.",0.6629244268915295,0.24759823854867966,0.0965624086490994,0.37143667124729235,0.026698629901599335,0.07421901981788703,0.7427193824511917
Economics of climate adaptive water management practices in Nepal,"This study analyses costs and benefits of the selected climate adaptive and equitable water management practices and strategies (CAEWMPS) in Dhulikhel Municipality and Dharan Sub-metropolitan city of Nepal. The CAEWMPS adopted the construction of water recharge pit at household level in Dharan and recharge ponds at community level in Dhulikhel. The results of household survey reveal that households have employed different coping strategies including minimizing consumption, purchasing from market, harvesting rain water and installing equipment for storing and pumping in both cities. In Dhulikhel, a significant number of households (18.56%) minimize consumption during the dry season but this is not the case in Dharan. Rather, around one-fifth (19.27%) of the households harvest rainwater in Dharan. In addition, households are forced to give-up their regular activities in order to implement coping strategies such as household chores, leisure time, meeting and gardening. The average estimated annual coping cost in Dharan (USD 87.5) is eight times higher than in Dhulikhel (USD 11.05); however, per unit coping cost is nearly equal in both the cities. In terms of benefit-cost ration, the community level recharge ponds in Dhulikhel (5.15) were found to be cost effective compared to the household level recharge pits of Dharan (1.72). These results provide policy makers with a comparative basis for adopting appropriate strategies to tackle problems related to water shortage under city-specific contexts.",0.46456976245392906,0.222816448040945,0.11160645302054813,0.5740629199588225,0.045666138856095065,0.23266969826808284,0.5169343860446487
Household Coping with and Adapting to River Flood Risk: Case Study of Becva River Basin,"Surveys of 304 households were used to determine flood risk reduction measures adopted in the case study of the Becva River in the Czech Republic. Coping and adaptation measures were differentiated for river flood risk, but uptake of both was low, irrespective of experience with floods. Cost seemed to be a barrier towards implementation, but more work is needed to understand the combination of factors limiting adoption of household flood risk reduction measures. Regression analysis indicated that more men and more children in a household would support the adoption of measures, as does perception of living in a flood risk zone. When a house is elevated up from ground level by 1 metre or more, the likelihood of taking further measures decreased by 20%. Further investigation of these factors and why, not just how, they influence household choices would support flood risk reduction strategies, especially under a changing climate.",0.22652951270895844,0.33481755863545604,0.110354186462591,0.2694633492595177,0.10427462606751811,0.6850624204474096,0.9077191147606466
What facilitates adaptation? An analysis of community-based adaptation to environmental change in the Andes,"This study analyses the environmental, socio-economic and institutional factors that influence community-based adaptation strategies in 16 municipalities in the rural Andes of Colombia. The study focuses specifically on the factors that influence whether communities decide to take measures to manage their water and micro-watersheds in response to water scarcity caused by climate variability and land-use changes. The research uses quantitative and qualitative methods incorporating data from surveys to 104 water user associations, precipitation and land-use data, municipal socio-economic information, and semi-structured interviews with key informants. The results reveal 1) the links between environmental change and the type of adaptation that communities implement, and 2) how, in face of water scarcity changes, external funding facilitates adaptation. The findings of this study contributes to the common-pool resource and adaptation literatures by highlighting the important role that external actors may have in shaping collective action to adapt to environmental change.",0.7181744838507591,0.36617776586347445,0.14952367088864485,0.4382948291023255,0.07745387101711569,0.06751027614075282,0.34808712271500186
Economic consequences of failed autonomous adaptation to extreme floods: A case study from Bangladesh,"This paper focuses on 'autonomous adaptation' and has one aim. It assesses the economic consequences of the failure effects of autonomous adaptation in response to extreme flood events. The study found that Bangladeshi farmers are highly resilient to extreme flood events, but the economic consequences of failure effects of autonomous crop adaptation on marginal farmers are large. The failure effects are defined as total input costs plus the small profit (otherwise) made from selling the small surplus remaining from subsistence needs. The total input costs increase with the number of flood events in the studied area. Total agricultural cost includes cost of seedlings, fertilizer, pesticides, land preparation, human labour and watering. The paper concludes that the economic loss accelerates food insecurity and could ultimately lead to human insecurity in Bangladesh, which could be exacerbated by the effects of climate change. © The Author(s) 2013.",0.633607904126639,0.2832666360128547,0.10649839745743722,0.5166956633363413,0.06487272015670141,0.08856568354654615,0.15713160687583141
The Role of Collective Efficacy in Climate Change Adaptation in India,"Research on adaptive capacity often focuses on economics and technology, despite evidence from the social sciences finding that socially shared beliefs, norms, and networks are critical in increasing individuals' and communities' adaptive capacity. Drawing upon social cognitive theory, this paper builds on the first author's Ph.D. dissertation and examines the role of collective efficacy people's shared beliefs about their group's capabilities to accomplish collective tasks in influencing Indians' capacity to adapt to drinking water scarcity, a condition likely to be exacerbated by future climate change. Using data from a national survey (N = 4031), individuals with robust collective efficacy beliefs were found to be more likely to participate in community activities intended to ensure the adequacy of water supplies, and this relationship was found to be stronger in communities with high levels of community collective efficacy compared to communities with low levels of community collective efficacy. In addition, community collective efficacy was positively associated with self-reported community adaptation responses. Public education campaigns aimed at increasing collective efficacy beliefs are likely to increase adaptive capacity.",0.47836417578638246,0.46492117031260566,0.09860991449032781,0.29605696184816516,0.15758011617432832,0.05822279296154924,0.48398664137502173
Keeping Cities Afloat: Climate Change Adaptation and Collaborative Governance at the Local Level,"The lack of a federal strategy in the United States for climate change adaptation leaves state and city governments with broad discretion to undertake appropriate measures. Yet, cities may be unable to adapt to climate change without external assistance. Fragmentation of authority in a federalist system has largely resulted in small jurisdictions that may be incapable of efficiently delivering public services. Collaboration allows cities to pool resources and work across boundaries to ameliorate problems, such as climate change. However, little is known about why and how collaborative governance may lead to better outputs and outcomes. Using the case of climate change adaptation in U.S. cities, this study seeks to understand collaborative governance better and its effects on sea level rise preparedness. Findings suggest that level of collaborative activity is positively associated with higher policy outputs and outcomes.",0.147421264551162,0.37387201807124676,0.11087627220868362,0.23312188857892652,0.1326104786657645,0.517551015479467,0.12791963301630382
"Investigating environmental migration and other rural drought adaptation strategies in Baja California Sur, Mexico","This paper explores the relationship between specific household traits (region of residence, head of household occupation, financial diversity, female level of education, land and animal ownership, social capital, and climate perception) and choice of specific adaptation strategies used by households in two sites in Baja California Sur, Mexico, during a severe drought from 2006 to 2012 using survey data and key informant interviews. We analyzed the co-occurrence of household traits adopting different drought adaptation strategies, then applied Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to examine the relationship between traits and strategies and integrated interview data to understand how rancheros perceive associations. We found evidence of diversity among households within the larger cultural group, both in the types of resources they have available and in the adaptation strategies they select. However, the most robust finding across the analyses appeared to be urban access; that is, the more a household was able to access urban services including piped water, the less likely they were to have used one of the drought adaptation strategies under study. These findings suggest that social structure and public investments are stronger predictors of smallholder adaptation rather than individual household traits. We also found that rancheros seem to rely less on traditional environmental migration to adapt to drought and rather settle in key watershed zones. We call for targeted policies to address inequities to access fresh water, including urban water, during drought times for the benefit of overall watershed health and the sustainability of rural ranchero livelihoods as they evolve to respond to climatological and economic change.",0.7915200836342464,0.3938774683433941,0.1122218207523336,0.5692136770580902,0.035300667236090974,0.09804759712738086,0.3383296893851799
"Community responses and adaptation strategies toward flood hazard in Jakarta, Indonesia","Jakarta, as the capital of the Republic of Indonesia, has long been known to be at risk from flood hazard. It is increasingly recognized that community responses and adaptation strategies are essential for planning future mitigation action. In order to investigate the community responses and adaptation strategies employed in Jakarta, in-depth interviews were performed in the flood-prone areas. The results reveal that vulnerability to flooding is increasing, and it is linked to several factors: (1) stakeholders, (2) environment, (3) communities, and (4) infrastructure and its maintenance. Various physical adaptation strategies have been adopted by the local communities, which include raising the housing level, building terraced housing, and building small dikes to prevent water entering the settlements. Several non-physical adaptations were also identified from the fieldwork. These adaptations tend to be conducted through communal work and the reuse of resources and materials left undamaged by flooding. However, uncoordinated responses during flood events produce greater exposure to the hazard, and it can be inferred that community responses remain below the ideal. This study highlights the need for urgent attention to be given to improving the institutional links between stakeholders, especially at the municipal level, which could provide more efficient disaster response.",0.19838163085404933,0.39692516319996923,0.12863983226748024,0.3489079461441015,0.10796641318404555,0.31676323176531973,0.5921825628896782
Challenges for adapting Bangkok's flood management systems to climate change,"This paper explores challenges for adapting urban areas to climate change by analyzing urban flood management systems in Bangkok, Thailand. The paper first identifies a set of common integrated urban flood management measures. Then it analyzes whether such measures are being practiced in Bangkok with considerations to climate change. While the analysis reveals that most identified measures are already being practiced, none of the measures have explicitly taken climate change into account in the design of the interventions. Moreover, a number of measures are being implemented as stand-alone interventions without considering implications to flood management. This is because there is no systematic coordination among departments in the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA). The current practice emphasizes structural options such as heightening flood walls and strengthening drainage and pumping capacity, but reducing flood risks under uncertainty requires putting more non-structural options in place that are compatible with structural options. Although measures that BMA should take to make the ongoing interventions more effective and climate-resilient can generally be incremental to what is being practiced, institutional arrangements to achieve such objectives will require a transformational change. The paper describes specific areas and steps as to how relevant departments can strengthen collaboration. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",0.18838567230966144,0.2923668496607234,0.1224986170552994,0.1951497592554543,0.20764214876141515,0.5566359638061319,0.42532482940118826
Climate change impact on small coastal river basins: from problem identification to adaptation in Klaipeda City,"Climate change is a process which is global in nature, but which has direct consequences at regional and local levels. Coastal areas as a whole, and small coastal river basins across the Baltic Sea in particular, are especially vulnerable since they directly suffer the influences of phenomena such as heavy precipitation and flash floods, the frequency of which has been increasing over the last few years, as well as rising sea levels. This paper describes the framework of the process of adaptation to climate change in small coastal river basins, based on a case study from the city of Klaipeda in Lithuania. In particular, the paper outlines the degree of vulnerability of coastal areas and describes some of the work undertaken and experiences gathered by the EU's BaltCICA project (Climate Change: Impacts, Costs and Adaptation in the Baltic Sea Region), which has been undertaken with a view to identify the problems and developing adaptation options in the region.",0.21011563845917533,0.3565020690433858,0.13254573248729237,0.2829294400547519,0.3698664562169611,0.5471377649237359,0.2038481282351219
"Why it takes an ""ontological shock' to prompt increases in small firm resilience: Sensemaking, emotions and flood risk","This article uses a sensemaking approach to understand small firms' responses to the threat of external shocks. By analysing semi-structured interviews with owners of flooded small firms, we investigate how owners process flood experiences and explore why such experiences do not consistently lead to the resilient adaptation of premises. We, conclude that some of the explanation for low levels of adaptation relates to a desire to defend existing sensemaking structures and associated identities. Sensemaking structures are only revised if these structures are not critical to business identity, or if a flood constitutes an ontological shock' and renders untenable existing assumptions regarding long-term business continuity. This article has implications for adaptation to the growing risk of flooding, climate change and external shocks. Future research analysing external shocks would benefit from using a sensemaking approach and survey studies should include measurements of ontological' impact as well as material and financial damage. In addition, those designing information campaigns should take account of small firms' resistance to information that threatens their existing sensemaking structures and social identities.",0.255158503353806,0.35264894856168527,0.1429333815615614,0.33663927013097905,0.10676414797088576,0.15865543939426383,0.21957875466787835
"Can burial societies be used to overcome flooding? Insurance and resilience in poor, urban South Africa","Collective actions enable poor African communities to achieve common goals and respond to key life hazards. This paper draws on in-depth interviews among poor entrepreneurs in two informal settlement areas in Cape Town, South Africa and how they manage climate-induced hazards, particularly flooding. The study assesses how one form of collective action, burial societies, can be used by members to overcome flood hazards. The findings suggest that the reciprocity principle in burial societies makes them a useful mechanism for flood management. However, there remains a gap in our knowledge on the ability of burial societies to respond to climate-induced shocks, and the issues that need to be addressed to make burial societies more appropriate to deal with flooding. These issues are outlined in the conclusion.",0.2109624653981269,0.35767300437271454,0.1130758946928282,0.35464391272818313,0.16543583869914066,0.3696569210420766,0.32847704524442084
The potential for sand dams to increase the adaptive capacity of East African drylands to climate change,"Drylands are home to more than two billion people and are characterised by frequent, severe droughts. Such extreme events are expected to be exacerbated in the near future by climate change. A potentially simple and cost-effective mitigation measure against drought periods is sand dams. This little-known technology aims to promote subsoil rainwater storage to support dryland agro-ecosystems. To date, there is little long-term empirical analysis that tests the effectiveness of this approach during droughts. This study addresses this shortcoming by utilising multi-year satellite imagery to monitor the effect of droughts at sand dam locations. A time series of satellite images was analysed to compare vegetation at sand dam sites and control sites over selected periods of drought, using the normalised difference vegetation index. The results show that vegetation biomass was consistently and significantly higher at sand dam sites during periods of extended droughts. It is also shown that vegetation at sand dam sites recovers more quickly from drought. The observed findings corroborate modelling-based research which identified related impacts on ground water, land cover, and socio-economic indicators. Using past periods of drought as an analogue to future climate change conditions, this study indicates that sand dams have potential to increase adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change in drylands. It therefore can be concluded that sand dams enhance the resilience of marginal environments and increase the adaptive capacity of drylands. Sand dams can therefore be a promising adaptation response to the impacts of future climate change on drylands.",0.7064382706578235,0.23175237473587038,0.11543247513126959,0.3212855237817244,0.035846673057497315,0.055613504016858245,0.36397336296476396
Adapting water policy tools to new issues: lessons from Colorado's experience over time,"The sustainable governance of freshwater resources requires that policymakers adapt to changing environmental and socioeconomic contexts. Yet scant literature has offered a systematic understanding of whether or how the issues that water policies address and the tools they use change over time. This paper explores both an original dataset of over 200 water laws passed by the state legislature of Colorado, USA throughout the 20th century and the secondary literature on the history of Colorado water policy. We show how policymakers have developed new policy tools over time in response to Colorado's changing issues, such as shifting and expanding water demands and values toward the environment. At the same time our analysis shows how Colorado's prior appropriation system of water rights places constraints on this adaptive capacity. Finally, the analysis suggests that as new issues have emerged on the agenda, old issues remain, thus challenging the ability of policymakers to respond to the full array of issues in coming years.",0.3823241756015057,0.30590089822470656,0.15411510993639302,0.3291934960840529,0.062289193090884994,0.10518314829572066,0.5583842669204679
Interdependence in rainwater management technologies: an analysis of rainwater management adoption in the Blue Nile Basin,"In the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopian highlands, rainfall distribution is extremely uneven both spatially and temporally. Drought frequently results in crop failure, while high rainfall intensities result in low infiltration and high runoff causing soil erosion and land degradation. These combined factors contribute to low agricultural productivity and high levels of food insecurity. Poor land management practices coupled with lack of effective rainwater management strategies aggravate the situation. Over the past two decades, however, the Government of Ethiopia has attempted to address many of these issues through a large-scale implementation of a number of soil and water conservation measures. Despite the success of interventions, uptake and adoption remains low. The conceptual framework of this study is based on the premise that farmers are more likely to adopt a combination of rainwater management technologies as adaptation mechanism against climate variability and agricultural production constraints. This contrasts the previous work that typically examined a single technology without considering the interdependence between technologies. Data used in this study come from household survey in seven watersheds in the Ethiopian Blue Nile Basin. A multivariate probit model was used to account for the potential correlation and interdependence of various components of rainwater management technologies. Our results suggest that rainwater management technologies are related with each other; hence, any effort to promote the adoption of rainwater management technologies has to consider such interdependence of technologies, or failure to do so may mask the reality that farmers face a set of choices in their adoption decisions.",0.9346824782725837,0.1921745649937855,0.12173611577547694,0.4552546509388902,0.03253570154004264,0.02921572969327741,0.16609813179734162
Changing local weather and adaptation in two coastal villages in Bangladesh,"Coastal Bangladesh is experiencing the effects of weather and climate-related stressors. The paper reports on the ways in which members of nine occupational groups in two coastal villages in South-west Bangladesh understand and respond differentially to recent changes in local weather and weather-related events and processes. Their understanding is grounded in local experiences and varied livelihood options, which are a complex interaction between people's social and spatial locations and local weather and non-weather events and processes. Their priorities are to protect livelihoods through resilience-building actions, which address proximate causes of vulnerability (improving coastal embankments, rehabilitating and strengthening homesteads, protecting agricultural land). Government support is limited to traditional development interventions that assist some more than others and often disconnected from local people's priorities. Most adaptation actions are practical measures within the prevailing politico-legal order. There is some evidence of more rights-based cooperative action between a national non-governmental organisation and local farmers that challenged aspects of that order. © 2015, © 2015 Indian Ocean Research Group.",0.2752833864247004,0.4398481391140773,0.10149896339806701,0.3882947285624768,0.25776619132214024,0.13425307748939283,0.09927124083721446
"Perceived and projected flood risk and adaptation in coastal Southeast Queensland, Australia","Evidence on the impacts of climate change is rapidly increasing but there is little change to the speed of climate adaptation by governments and individuals. There are multiple barriers to climate adaptation, including among others: the lack of the public understanding of risks, lack of leadership and availability of resources to adapt. In this study, we assess to what extent coastal residents understand their properties' flood risk, and what predicts their risk perception and adaptation behaviour. We surveyed 420 individuals in South East Queensland projected to be within the permanent or temporary flood zone in 2100 based on combined sea-level rise and storm surge scenarios. We assessed the correlations between the projected (i.e. objective) and perceived risk of inundation, adaptation behaviour, and the individual characteristics considered to influence risk perception and adaptation. While we found a correlation between perceived and some objective flood risks, perceived risk only partially reflected objective risk. Other factors that influenced risk perception were previous experience of flooding events, belief in climate change, risk aversion, age and gender. Factors driving risk perception varied with the type (permanent, temporary) and frequency of flooding event (1 in 20 or 1 in 100 years). Previous experience with extreme event impacts and belief in climate change influenced all future perceived risks. However, even after being impacted by an extreme event, adaptation was moderate (58 %). Personal as well as environmental factors influence the likelihood of adaptation. The moderate adaptation response within our case study is likely a result of most respondents considering large flooding events to be rare and of limited impact, and anticipating future government aid to overcome flooding damage costs. Existing attitudes towards risk, which influence the extent of proactive adaptation, should be of concern to governments who will likely be facing these costs at increasing frequencies.",0.16406910067376423,0.40017448227185703,0.13440718703763757,0.18681923407792533,0.09262183603011645,0.3519283517270472,0.44139339598033495
Farmers' decision-making process under drought,"Although a large body of research exists discussing the subject of drought management and the mechanisms that are employed by farmers to formulate decisions during such an event, the farmers' response to drought remains poorly understood due to the oversimplified assumptions about farmers' behavior in response to drought. Furthermore, little is known about the potential efficacy of the coping strategies that are adopted by farmers. To gather this knowledge, a mixed method, qualitative-quantitative study was conducted in Fars province, Iran. A survey of 255 farmers, selected through a multistage stratified random sampling method, revealed that farmers' decisions to manage a drought were the result of a complex web of natural, economic, structural, and cognitive factors. Additionally, an analysis of decision models revealed that there were different patterns of coping responses utilized in the different stages of drought that expanded from short-term adjustment to long-term adaptation. Furthermore, a decision tree analysis indicated that although a large percentage of farmers made some adjustments in response to drought, they were not able to overcome the increasing impacts of the drought. In this respect, it was recommended to consider various economic incentives, promote affordable coping strategies, and combine agricultural interventions with social support services.

This research study aimed to address the gap between resilience thinking and practice by focusing on learning, a key aspect of resilience. Two Canadian watershed groups were led in 2-day workshops focused on resilience. Learning effects were measured using a survey administered both before and after the workshop, and a qualitative survey was administered 6 months later to understand longer term effects. Short-term learning effects were similar between the two case studies, with strong cognitive and relational learning and less normative learning. Longer term effects showed enduring cognitive and normative learning in both cases; however, relational learning persisted only in the watershed where a resilience practice approach to watershed planning had been incorporated. Future research directions include refinements to the learning measurement methodology and continuing to build resilience practice literature.",0.38018821387318974,0.40945702915980786,0.14743493795584664,0.3468203018482452,0.07618399625440433,0.10275484178401868,0.20655297210728893
"Adaptive capacity, drought and the performance of community-based drinking water organizations in Costa Rica","Community-based drinking water organizations (CBDWOs) are the most important providers of water in rural areas of the developing world. They are responsible for coping with future threats due to climate change, besides other non-climatic drivers of change such as demographic growth. The inherent capacities of CBDWOs to adapt to external drivers of change would be greatly conditioned by their capacities to initiate and catalyze collective processes. The rich background of CDBWOs' actual and historical responses to drought phenomena is an essential starting point for understanding both the processes and the limitations of adapting to future adverse climatic events. In this study, we contrast six CBDWOs located in the Costa Rican dry corridor, in order to analyze their ability to self-organize coping with recent annual periodical droughts. We found that CBDWOs implement hard, soft, and ecosystem-based adaptation measures. The decisions in this regard are reactive, tend to follow a sequential order, and are context dependent. One of the main factors that facilitates capital-intensive adaptation measures is the ability of CBDWOs to mobilize internal or external financial resources, which further depends on social capital and the governance structure.",0.5670961626261736,0.31265275445816015,0.146845413988439,0.34950915161291374,0.0879043719100974,0.05419725523188539,0.43437800990384956
"Rainfall variability, occupational choice, and welfare in rural Bangladesh","The determinants of occupational focus versus diversification between household members in rural Bangladesh are investigated as an autonomous and proactive adaptation strategy against ex ante local rainfall variability risks. Nationally representative household level survey data are combined with historical climate variability information at the Upazila level. Flood prone Upazilas are distinguished from non-flood prone Upazilas, since the latter may be susceptible to higher risks from local rainfall variability. Adult members of the same household are found to be less likely than the household head to be self-employed in agriculture in areas with high local rainfall variability. Moreover, it is shown that occupational diversification comes at a cost in terms of lower household-level welfare (consumption). The effects of three policy actions, such as access to credits, safety net, and markets are considered. Access to market appears to be more effective in reducing the likelihood of costly within household occupational diversification as an ex ante climate risk reducing strategy as compared to access to credit and safety nets.",0.7450610001925236,0.1961686362576262,0.06776015206708834,0.6637066589917395,0.07098031218518856,0.06275491704360416,0.1079404843604721
Perception and understanding of drought and coping strategies of farming households in north-west Balochistan,"Balochistan is prone to drought and has been impacted severely during 1998-2002. The people are engaged in orchard and livestock farming activities for earning their livelihoods. The main focus of this paper is to understand the perception and understanding about drought by the farming households, and their coping and adaptive mechanism. This study is based on both secondary and primary sources of data collected from 215 farm households following a structured questionnaire survey. The results indicate that farmers perception regarding climatic variability and drought are in line with the results obtained using the secondary climatic data and information. Even though the respondents have religious belief in interpreting the weather related issues, the climatic and environmental factors such as increased temperature, decreased precipitation, change in the timing of rainy season, and other factors like inadequate supply of electricity for irrigation, over exploitation of groundwater, population growth eft were also recognized and mentioned by them that aggravate the drought severity in the area As a consequence of drought, proportionate losses in fruits production and livestock are higher among poorer and marginal land holding farmers. To cope with the drought, they have adapted a number of strategies at farm and off-farm levels that include crop and water management practices, adjustment in agricultural inputs, seeking off-farm employment, assets depletion, consumption smoothing, borrowing, and migrating to other places to seek alternative sources of income. This study implies for specific policy and practice oriented solutions in order to cope with and adapt in drought situation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Measuring Progress on Climate Change Adaptation Policy by Dutch Water Boards,"The Netherlands is particularly vulnerable for the impacts of climate change on the water system. Regional water authorities, or water boards, are given an important role to design and implement specific adaptation policies and measures to manage these impacts. From the early 2000s onwards water boards are starting to adapt to climate change impacts, yet no systematic assessments exist to assess whether or not progress is being made and what explains similarities and differences across water boards. This paper aims to address these critical questions by analyzing the progress of all Dutch water boards for the period 2005-2016. We systematically collected and analyzed three consecutive water management plans for all 23 water boards in the Netherlands. We use content analysis methods to analyze progress by looking into their vulnerability and three levels of adaptation: recognition, groundwork and adaptation action. The results show that over time the number of reported climate change adaptation initiatives by the water boards is increasing, but most climate change adaptation is still at the recognition or groundwork level. Our findings reveal a diversity of efforts to adapt to climate change among Dutch water boards. We conclude that while (inter)national water and climate change adaptation policies have called for more adaptation action at regional levels, the unequal progress across the Netherlands suggests that existing 'soft' policy measures to push for adaptation might not be sufficient to ensure progress on adaptation across all water boards.",0.43466702272214064,0.30263201898097847,0.30769012295899617,0.10798922323099239,0.09802356401675394,0.2737181107778255,0.5911527136799112
"Exploring climate change perceptions, rainfall trends and perceived barriers to adaptation in a drought affected region in India","Climate change poses major challenges to agricultural systems in drought prone regions of the world especially in the areas with high poverty, lack of irrigation facilities and low productivity. Towards this it is essential to understand the climate change perceptions, adaptation practices and barriers to effective adaptation at household and community level. This paper using household surveys and focus group discussions in one of the drought prone areas of Odisha in India, explores various aspects of perception on climate change and barriers to adaptation. It also analyses the accuracy of perceptions based on rainfall data from nearest meteorological stations. The study reinforces the argument by earlier studies that the perception by people simply cannot be wrong because they may have a just a low correlation with underlying meteorological data. Results suggest that farmers increasingly perceive the changes in the rainfall and temperature patterns. However, when compared with the trend in actual rainfall data, perceptions on rainfall are found to more closely align with the results from the nearest station as compared to the station farther from it. Analysis revealed that seasonal rainfall variability has a profound influence on the farmers' perceptions on climate change and drought in the study region. Farmers' are still dependent on the traditional forecasting system because of the lack of access to modern climate forecasting and tailored information for agricultural practice. Although farmers in the study region are already adapting to the changing climate, the study finds that while lack of access to water and irrigation, information on climate change adaptation and early warning systems are major barriers to adaptation at the household level lack of government intervention, lack of knowledge on drought resistant crops and varieties and lack of renovation of water bodies and irrigation were mentioned as the major barriers at the community level. Findings from the paper argue for better adaptation planning at the local level incorporating local level perceptions and barriers to adaptation. In such areas local level planning can be crucial in enhancing the adaptive capacity of the farmers.",0.9564461262750311,0.1733608270219373,0.06619082454558751,0.5200429055685163,0.038041871136091164,0.025141918877173288,0.3370598516925946
"Gauging climate preparedness to inform adaptation needs: local level adaptation in drinking water quality in CA, USA","Understanding resource managers' perceptions of climate change, analytic capacity, and current adaptation activities can provide insight into what can help support adaptation processes at the local level. In California, where a major drought currently demonstrates some of the hardships that could be regularly encountered under a changing climate, we present results from a survey of drinking water utilities about the perceived threat, analytic capacity, and adaptation actions related to maintaining water quality in the face of climate change. Among surveyed utilities (n = 259), awareness is high in regard to climate change occurring and its potential impacts on water quality globally, but perceived risk is lower with regard to climate impacts on local drinking water quality. Just over half of surveyed utilities report at least some adaptation activity to date. The top three variables that most strongly correlated with reported adaptation action were (1) perceived risk on global and local water quality, (2) surface water reliance, and (3) provision of other services beyond drinking water. Other tested variables significantly correlated with reported adaptation action were (4) degree of impact from the current drought and (5) communication with climate change experts. Findings highlight that smaller groundwater-reliant utilities may need the most assistance to initiate climate adaptation processes. Trusted information sources most frequently used across respondents were state government agencies, followed by colleagues in the same utilities. The finding that frequently used sources of information are similar across utilities presents a promising opportunity for training and disseminating climate information to assist those systems needing the most support.",0.6218653667431929,0.2891311992537939,0.15550371539545185,0.18596005254141842,0.04265267651220223,0.12441994599019916,0.29000129630125565
Managing the water cycle in Kenyan small-scale maize farming systems: Part 1. Farmer perceptions of drought and climate variability,"Farmer perceptions clearly influence the adoption of technology and adaptation to climate change, but may not be consistent with or captured by scientific measurements. There has been a significant research on how perceptions influence water resource management and adaptation to climate, but conclusions are unclear or contradictory. This research aimed to clarify what shapes perceptions and how this understanding can refine meteorological data collection and to make more relevant and useful tools for farmers to adapt to changes in the water cycle. A survey of 244 small-scale maize farmers was conducted using a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews in two districts in southern and western Kenya which differed in climate type and farming systems. Farmer perceptions of and adaptation to climate uncertainty were investigated and compared with meteorological data. Most farmers perceived changes in the patterns of rainfall and dry spells, including later onset of rains than in the past. They have already adjusted their management based on these perceptions, including later planting times. Despite this, analysis of meteorological data indicated no major trends in rainfall or dry spell patterns in the two regions. This research confirms that the perception that the water cycle is changing is based on a combination of climatic, economic, or social observations, and farmers are already changing their management to adapt to the perceived changes in climate. The article explores the reasons why these perceptions were inconsistent with the available meteorological data and suggests that research may improve the usefulness of meteorological data to farmers.

Influences on adaptive planning to reduce flood risks among parishes in south Louisiana,"Residents of south Louisiana face a range of increasing, climate-related flood exposure risks that could be reduced through local floodplain management and hazard mitigation planning. A major incentive for community planning to reduce exposure to flood risks is offered by the Community Rating System (CRS) of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP encourages local collective action by offering reduced flood insurance premiums for individual policy holders of communities where suggested risk-reducing measures have been implemented. This preliminary analysis examines the extent to which parishes (counties) in southern Louisiana have implemented the suggested policy actions and identifies key factors that account for variation in the implementation of the measures. More measures implemented results in higher CRS scores. Potential influences on scores include socioeconomic attributes of residents, government capacity, average elevation and past flood events. The results of multiple regression analysis indicate that higher CRS scores are associated most closely with higher median housing values. Furthermore, higher scores are found in parishes with more local municipalities that participate in the CRS program. The number of floods in the last five years and the revenue base of the parish does not appear to influence CRS scores. The results shed light on the conditions under which local adaptive planning to mitigate increasing flood risks is more likely to be implemented and offer insights for program administrators, researchers and community stakeholders.",0.1458517999282428,0.3588108344866144,0.16125198501763935,0.24839993998306067,0.10088467287306685,0.5147513786718934,0.8233655948993367
Local resilience towards overcoming floods of local climate change for adaptation: A study of marunda community in north jakarta,"Sea level rise due the climate change has emerged the coastal flood phenomena in North Jakarta. Coastal flood gives a negative impact on the environment and socio-economic life of the Marunda community, forcing the communities to be locally adapted towards the disaster. Community Local adaptation defined as an effort to reduce the risk of flooding based on their behavioral and cultural actions. The purpose of this study was to identify the community local adaptation strategies in confronting the coastal flooding based on the socio-economic and environmental perspectives in Marunda, North Jakarta, Indonesia. This study uses a narrative review analysis from indepth interviews, observations, and literature studies. Data analysis includes the stage of action diagnosis and action evaluation. Based on the results, the local adaptation strategy in Marunda community are classified into three phases, namely at the step before, after, and during a flood. These three stages contain elements of physical and social adaptation derived from the ability of the community to remember experiences, learning from experience, and sharing experiences with individuals and other groups. These three abilities help the community to take adaptation actions so that the Marunda community becomes resilient to coastal flood.",0.13359275384601296,0.4888407664784667,0.11594983460017097,0.2562780920989338,0.4313543999038854,0.5183007420100707,0.5545775217954831
Harvesting Water for Living with Drought: Insights from the Brazilian Human Coexistence with Semi-Aridity Approach towards Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals,"The Semi-Arid region of Brazil (SAB) has been periodically affected by moderate to extreme droughts, jeopardizing livelihoods and severely impacting the life standards of millions of family farmers. In the early 1990s the Human Coexistence with Semi-Aridity (HCSA) emerged as a development approach. The debate on HCSA is limited to Brazilian literature but as a technological and a bottom-up governance experience, researches on the topic could add some insights to international debate on living with drought. The present paper adopts an historical perspective on HCSA before discussing the main HCSA's rainwater-harvesting methods found in two case studies in the SAB as a local appropriate and advanced technological package for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Qualitative analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews with key local stakeholders, 29 unstructured interviews with family farmers, and surveys in 499 family farms are used. The results show that regardless the highly adaptive potential, the technologies are adopted in differ rates among them and in between case studies chosen, influenced by non-technological factors and interacting the broader public policies context. Scaling up the HCSA's technologies in the rural SAB is a development path towards the SDGs.",0.722555896472718,0.28481972876132167,0.10366094125976805,0.4454460359906481,0.0522283402177574,0.033349277495574134,0.08793917550447458
"Public-private partnership in enhancing farmers' adaptation to drought: Insights from the Lujiang Flatland in the Nu River (Upper Salween) valley, China","Agriculture is an important type of land use but suffers from drought, especially under global climate change scenarios. Although government is a major actor in helping farmers to adapt to drought, lack of funds has constrained its efforts. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mechanism has been widely applied in urban infrastructure development to raise fund for public goods and services, but very few studies explored its role in rural areas. Based on interview of 139 fanning households and open-ended interview of village heads, government officials and company representatives, in the Lujiang Flatland in the Nu River (Upper Salween) Valley, Southwest China, this paper aims to reveal how PPP functions to enhance farmers' adaptation to drought. We found that farmers have developed multiple strategies in their own ways to adapt to drought, including pumping and store water, using water-saving irrigation techniques, changing of crops, and strengthening water management at the community level, while insufficient funds, water resource scarcity and mismatch of time-scale of crop growth and drought even hindered their adaptation options. Limited fund sources, gap in policy implementation and weak performance of government-funded projects hindered governmental supports to be effective. Weak motivation and distrusted by farmers limited the engagement of private enterprises in supporting farmers to adapt to drought. PPP mechanism has the potential to mobilize fund from multiple sources, share costs, risks and benefits among different stakeholders, combine both scientific and local knowledge, and reduce uncertainty through formal and informal institutions. Benefited from these advantages, PPP mechanism could improve project performance, thus increase farmers' adaptation options and resilience to drought. This study offers referential lessons and valuable insights for agricultural development, especially for mountain communities vulnerable to exceptional and recurrent drought episodes under warming climate.",0.9174967032326071,0.2120596428739217,0.10171890487324992,0.31586477156983367,0.019435637664217357,0.06250758506943381,0.46769854971560904
Achieving water security in rural Indian Himalayas: A participatory account of challenges and potential solutions,"The complex and diverse factors that influence water security in the Indian Himalayan Region were examined using problem and solution tree (PAST) mapping together with a field study. Five PASTs, each constructed by a different group of stakeholders, namely the state government, the local government, researchers, development agencies, and the local community, were analysed to obtain a holistic and multi-sectoral understanding of water security in the region, and the analysis was supplemented with field data. The systematic study helped in (1) identifying many factors - climatic, geographical, cultural, and socio-economic - that influence water security, (2) assessing their impacts on mountain livelihoods, and (3) documenting thirty-two potential interventions in the form of adaptations (e.g. springshed management programme) and coping strategies (e.g. buying water from informal water markets) to strengthen water security. These strategies followed three main themes namely conserving water resources, improving rural livelihood and sustainable infrastructure development and risk management. The study also helped in building a shared sense of understanding, purpose, and action between the diverse groups of stakeholders. The study suggests that ensuring water security in rural mountain areas requires holistic and multi-sectoral policies, which should be developed by including all actors in the network of stakeholders; that local conditions be given utmost importance in the policy planning cycle (e.g. focus on springs in mountains); and that cultural landscape and local identities be closely examined to reduce the inequalities in access to resources.",0.6820487555490277,0.29898371981826605,0.1514972273847327,0.43253256612739777,0.06447864339353052,0.0891695208177127,0.41952509729527526
"Land-use response to drought scenarios and water policy intervention in Lijiang, SW China","As a part of the Asian highlands, Lijiang, in the northwest of Yunnan Province, China, is threatened by climate-induced drought and an increasing water demand by tourism development. Understanding local farmers' land-use options in response to drought and policy intervention is crucial for future adaptation strategies. We assessed farmers' land-use options and the socio-economic factors affecting decisions under drought and water policy scenarios using household surveys. From the total of 174 households surveyed, whether under a drought scenario or a drought scenario with water policy intervention, we found that respondents preferred land-use options focusing on four choices: keep current pattern; keep crops, but reduce areas; abandon farming; rent out farmlands. Findings suggest that there is a growing pattern of agricultural abandonment for urban jobs as a strategy to cope with climate change impacts. The results identified a total of five socio-economic factors that have a significant effect on the households' land-use options. These factors are important for the households' land-use decisions and could prevent people from altering their livelihood strategies. We provide some specific recommendations which could enhance local households' potential adaptation to drought, as well as for effective management of water to prevent potential conflicts in the design or implementation of water policy with the local community.

"An assessment of adaptation planning for flood variability in the Okavango Delta, Botswana","In the Okavango Delta, Botswana, household adaptation to climatic variability hinges upon access to wetland resources. Household adaptation may be effective for current flood variability, but inadequate for future climate variability. Government interventions through adaptation planning for flood variability may also be inadequate. This study aimed to improve knowledge on adaptation planning in the Okavango Delta and similar areas in the world. The specific objectives were to determine household exposure, adaptive capacity and sensitivity to flood-related shocks, identify and assess government interventions for flood variability, and determine the effect of these interventions on household adaptation to flood variability in the Okavango Delta. Informed by the institutional analysis and development framework, the study used data from a survey of 623 households in five villages, some qualitative methods and secondary data sources. The results indicate that households are inherently sensitive to shocks, due to their dependence on natural resource-based livelihood activities, and that most households had sick members (53 %), and were food insecure (74 %). More households were more affected by river desiccation (84 %) than by flooding (23 %). Adaptation planning was implicitly undertaken in the form of disaster risk reduction, and mainstream development and poverty reduction programmes. These effectively contributed to household adaptation to flood variability but inhibited local institutional learning and innovation. Moreover, they were neither participatory nor conformant to local norms and therefore not sustainable in the long term. There is a need to adopt explicit, flexible and participatory approaches to planning to promote autonomous adaptation to flood variability in the Okavango Delta.",0.3528615249987267,0.314421908770899,0.12196431677588589,0.5,0.15958437888256358,0.20779700331958323,0.3663488149770156
"Re-thinking the unimpeded tube-well growth under the depleting groundwater resources in the Punjab, Pakistan","Groundwater resources are crucial in sustaining agro-ecosystems and ensuring food security in many parts of the world, including Pakistan. However, the sustainability of groundwater resources is subject to a number of challenges, including over-extraction, deterioration in quality, and vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and population growth. Given the current state of groundwater resources in Pakistan, policymakers seek to manage groundwater resources by limiting groundwater extraction. To achieve this goal on a national scale, it is important to understand the determinants of the decisions made by local farmers in respect of tube-well adoption. This study investigates smallholder farmers' decisions to adopt tube-well technology in the face of dwindling groundwater resources and falling water tables. Analysis is based on a cross-sectional survey of 200 rural households from the arid to semi-arid predominantly groundwater-irrigated plains of the Punjab province, Pakistan. It is found that farmers will adopt tube-well technology in pursuit of reliable irrigation water supplies to hedge against production risks but not against the risk associated with unfavourable extreme events (downside risk) such as total crop failure. This suggests that the adoption decision is influenced by the expected long-term rather than the short-term benefits. This paper draws attention to the need to regulate groundwater resource exploitation by requiring the use of tube-well technology to be accompanied by irrigation water-efficient techniques and technologies.",0.9322086766890406,0.19889855975550086,0.1216076729249098,0.4390875950857581,0.027791479735952012,0.03380325230015773,0.16074233333348598
"Integrated environmental assessment to explore water resources management in Al Jabal Al Akhdar, Sultanate of Oman","Al Jabal Al Akhdar, an arid mountain region in northern Oman, has experienced rapid development over the last decades, resulting in the deterioration of water resources. This paper applies the driving force-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework as an integrated environmental assessment tool to illustrate the cause-and-effect relationships for sustainable management of water resources in the area. The research aimed to examine social and ecological aspects of mountain water to explore optimal approaches for sustainable use and management. The water resources are affected by increasing drivers of population growth and socio-economic development, through agriculture, tourism, and urbanization, exerting pressures through overconsumption of water, coupled with the exogenous pressure of climate change. The decreased rainfall and increased water demand have resulted in the degradation of water quantity and quality. The declining state of the water resources and reduced area of cultivation have resulted in considerable losses in agricultural income. The Omani government has adopted some responses, including water development projects, acting to reduce pressures as well as to improve the state of water resources. The DPSIR analysis indicates that trade-offs should be made between economic development and the continued supply of water for the agro-ecological system; choices could be in the prioritization of drivers. A dependence on desalinated water will introduce a reliance on a non-renewable external energy supply and is unlikely to ensure water supply at the multi-century timescale of the social-ecological system. In addition, tourism is predominantly based around the disappearing agro-ecosystems which in turn are dependent on the supply of water. Therefore, efforts should be directed towards improving water-use efficiency through installing modern irrigation technology, water conservation methods, use of greywater and treated wastewater, and rainwater harvesting as well as integrated water resources management, and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.",0.6169032597365491,0.18168969465213788,0.23748152099657202,0.2515318623991237,0.03351518890593398,0.08094423869600419,0.9503153825546464
Adapting Agricultural Water Use to Climate Change in a Post-Soviet Context: Challenges and Opportunities in Southeast Kazakhstan,"The convergence of climate change and post-Soviet socio-economic and institutional transformations has been underexplored so far, as have the consequences of such convergence on crop agriculture in Central Asia. This paper provides a place-based analysis of constraints and opportunities for adaptation to climate change, with a specific focus on water use, in two districts in southeast Kazakhstan. Data were collected by 2 multi-stakeholder participatory workshops, 21 semi-structured in-depth interviews, and secondary statistical data. The present-day agricultural system is characterised by enduring Soviet-era management structures, but without state inputs that previously sustained agricultural productivity. Low margins of profitability on many privatised farms mean that attempts to implement integrated water management have produced water users associations unable to maintain and upgrade a deteriorating irrigation infrastructure. Although actors engage in tactical adaptation measures, necessary structural adaptation of the irrigation system remains difficult without significant public or private investments. Market-based water management models have been translated ambiguously to this region, which fails to encourage efficient water use and hinders adaptation to water stress. In addition, a mutual interdependence of informal networks and formal institutions characterises both state governance and everyday life in Kazakhstan. Such interdependence simultaneously facilitates operational and tactical adaptation, but hinders structural adaptation, as informal networks exist as a parallel system that achieves substantive outcomes while perpetuating the inertia and incapacity of the state bureaucracy. This article has relevance for critical understanding of integrated water management in practice and adaptation to climate change in post-Soviet institutional settings more broadly.",0.6327986519264912,0.24269541770131162,0.1643988507076723,0.2682392387157318,0.06588035193150266,0.10578787598477654,0.6099650167198271
Strategies for coping and adapting to flooding and their determinants: A comparative study of cases from Namibia and Zambia,"It has been reported that flood events in Namibia and Zambia will increase, due to the variability and changes in the climate, thus increasing the number of people that are exposed to flooding disasters. This exposure will negatively impact the livelihoods of rural households if no interventions are implemented to strengthen the coping and adaptive capacity of the affected local population against flooding. The purpose of this case study was to determine the adaptation strategies that are adopted by rural households to floods in the eastern part of the Zambezi Region in Namibia and the Mwandi District in Zambia. The study further examined how socio-economic factors influence the choice of different adaptation strategies. The adaptation strategies were categorised into two groups, namely, short-term coping strategies and long-term adaptation strategies. Six focus group meetings were held and a questionnaire survey of 207 randomly-sampled households was conducted in the flood-prone areas of the study. In Namibia, the results indicated that the majority (96%) of the households coped with floods by gardening and sold poles, 74% sold firewood, 61% collected wild food and 59% received food aid during floods events. In Zambia, the major coping strategies included the sale of reeds and thatching grass (53%), firewood sales (51%), charcoal production and sales (51%) and wild food collection for sale (50%). With regard to the long-term adaptation strategies, the households in Namibia learnt to live with the floods; they engaged in the mafisa cattle trade (86%), they harvested the flood water (68%), changed the planting dates (63%), prayed (55%) and practiced conservation agriculture (54%) and fish farming (53%). In Zambia, the main long-term adaptation strategies were conservation agriculture (91%), the acquisition of preparedness skills (66%), the harvesting of flood water (63%), prayer (60%), and the practice of flood-proofing (52%). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the age, the land size, the length of stay in the flood plain, the duration of the floods, as well as their marital status, significantly influenced their choice of long-term adaptation strategies. Short-term strategies are heavily dependent on natural resources, which may put pressure on these resources. The study concludes that a variety of factors influence the choice of any specific adaptation strategy. For policy purposes, this suggests that the relevant stakeholder interventions should consider these determinants, in order to enhance the adaptive capacity of rural households to flooding. This study seeks to inform decision-makers and practitioners on how the disaster risks can be reduced and managed in the similar environments of the two countries, and to inform them of the status quo of flood adaptation.",0.657364411003613,0.3109369176436402,0.07190875219521117,0.663359114776428,0.09847441252188491,0.17137626185865795,0.5656053901085487
"The impact of and responses to flooding in Thulamela Municipality, Limpopo Province, South Africa","The frequency of climate-related disasters such as floods is growing due to environmental and human factors. This paper examines the impact of flooding and communities' perceptions towards responses to flooding in the cases of Maniini and Tshilungwi Villages in the Thulamela Municipality in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. A questionnaire survey was conducted with 60 household respondents in the two selected villages and then analysed. Key-informant interviews with community leaders and municipality officials established the key impact of and responses to the flooding. Secondary data on flooding provided useful historical trends in the region. Field observations assisted in corroborating information provided in interviews. The findings indicate that communities are vulnerable to flood disasters, and these disasters had a significant impact on infrastructure and the livelihood of the selected communities. An increase in household income and levels of education as well as access to grants decreased households' vulnerability in cases of flooding. The responses to flooding by the municipality were viewed negatively by the community who did not support permanent relocation. Hence, the article points out the need to strengthen coping mechanisms by local governments and communities themselves in order to cope with the impact of flooding.",0.3550230646101941,0.4306204151913674,0.06988295872866587,0.5136119259025337,0.17506312165704188,0.11206243554662314,0.3721619750843367
The effect of flood experience on household mitigation-Evidence from longitudinal and insurance data,"Proactive flood: damage mitigation on the household level is seen as a crucial element of comprehensive flood risk management. The ongoing socio-economic development and climate change will further increase the relevance of flood risks in the future. This paper analyses the causal effect of flood experience on mitigation decisions of households. It contributes to the emerging literature on the determinants of private flood mitigation and adopts data which has rarely been used in the field: Instead of cross-sectional data, longitudinal data of household surveys before and after a major flood event in Germany is used (N > 7,400). Flood experience is elicited by three different data sources: reports of heads of households, issuance of flood alerts, and damage reports of the insurance industry. The results show a causal effect of insured flood damage on private flood mitigation and a correlation of mitigation with self reported flood experience. The estimated effects differ for mitigation types (higher for behavioural options, such as ""adapted use"") and household types (higher for better educated heads of households).

Developing drought resilience in irrigated agriculture in the face of increasing water scarcity,"In many countries, drought is the natural hazard that causes the greatest agronomic impacts. After recurrent droughts, farmers typically learn from experience and implement changes in management to reduce their future drought risks and impacts. This paper aims to understand how irrigated agriculture in a humid climate has been affected by past droughts and how different actors have adapted their activities and strategies over time to increase their resilience. After examining recent drought episodes from an agroclimatic perspective, information from an online survey was combined with evidence from semi-structured interviews with farmers to assess: drought risk perceptions, impacts of past drought events, management strategies at different scales (regional to farm level) and responses to future risks. Interviews with the water regulatory agency were also conducted to explore their attitudes and decision-making processes during drought events. The results highlight how agricultural drought management strategies evolve over time, including how specific aspects have helped to reduce future drought risks. The importance of adopting a vertically integrated drought management approach in the farming sector coupled with a better understanding of past drought impacts and management options is shown to be crucial for improving decision-making during future drought events.",0.8101939087702617,0.26272399836632815,0.09764279094521594,0.2676804624356409,0.03666425289441259,0.060739072224493956,0.47964593448499887
How do people's perceptions and climatic disaster experiences influence their daily behaviors regarding adaptation to climate change? A case study among young generations,"Adaptation is a commonly applied strategy used to address individual behavior changes, in response to climate change. However, in-depth, evidence-based investigations of the relationships among individual perceptions, climatic disaster experiences, and daily behaviors regarding adaptation to climate change remain to be conducted. We obtained survey data from 488 respondents in southwestern China, a region prone to frequent and severe droughts, to assess factors that influence adaptive behaviors and to identify their pathways. We applied Construal Level Theory (CLT) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to differentiate between respondents' high-level abstract construals and their low-level concrete construals. We analyzed the influences of these two levels of perception, combined with drought experiences on water-saving behaviors. We developed a structural equation model to estimate the correlation coefficients of the latent and observed variables in the structural process linked to the respondents' adaptive behaviors. The results found that a concrete perception of saving water plays a more significant part than an abstract perception of climate change in prompting specific adaptive behaviors. Improving public perceptions of climate change might increase the desirability of adaptation, whereas improving perceptions of water saving might increase the feasibility of implementing adaptive measures. Experience influenced individual behaviors, but that influence was indirect through its effects on perceptions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Resilient urban water supply: preparing for the slow-moving consequences of climate change,"Extensive efforts have been made in preparedness and restorative action to mitigate impacts on critical water sector services from extreme events, such as storms, earthquakes, and terrorism. Comparatively, with some exceptions, the more gradual, slow-moving consequences associated with climate change have garnered lower priority in decision-making processes. This research focuses on surface-and ground-water source contamination by elevated chloride levels, which is a common climate-induced effect. Historic and current response actions by water utilities to address elevated chloride levels were analyzed based on a literature review and interviews with water utility professionals. Key lessons and findings were selected to highlight the operational challenges, solutions implemented, and the adaptive measures considered to improve community water supply resilience.",0.4055838469962714,0.33549399106682126,0.1608599618769716,0.1660710064122715,0.09869722805915475,0.19998729770332682,0.4569320402827952
Preparing for flooding in England and Wales: the role of risk perception and the social context in driving individual action,"Flooding is a major threat to the local communities in the UK, and the risks are increasing due to climate change. Encouraging homeowners to prepare for the consequences of catastrophic flooding is imperative. This study aims to examine the ways in which individuals' risk perceptions and socio-cultural characteristics co-determine the preparedness for flood hazards. It is based on a social survey about household arrangements that can reduce the economic losses arising from flooding and enhance community resilience. A total of 485 responses were solicited from homeowners in England and Wales. Results confirm that the intention to act is socially motivated. This indicates the need for addressing the role of social networks and engagement with local community in enhancing community resilience to flooding. On the other hand, the effect of risk-related considerations is complicated. Perceived severity of flood damage is associated with intended actions, whereas risk characteristics are not. This implies that although providing relevant risk information to the public is crucial, appealing to the feelings of fears and uncertainties is less likely to be effective in driving actions for managing flood risks than has been usually assumed. The findings have practical implications for policy-making and climate risk communication.",0.16967920067078074,0.4282271966570216,0.09918760924874406,0.23309249263846954,0.1906765846215646,0.26186352608402397,0.5198233846400595
"The implications of rural perceptions of water scarcity on differential adaptation behaviour in Rajasthan, India","Water scarcity is one of the most critical issues facing agriculture today. To understand how people manage the risk of water scarcity and growing pressures of increased climate variability, exploring perceptions of risk and how these perceptions feed into response behaviour and willingness to adapt is critical. This paper revisits existing frameworks that conceptualise perceptions of environmental risk and decision-making, and uses empirical evidence from an in-depth study conducted in Rajasthan, India, to emphasise how individual and collective memories, and experience of past extreme events shape current definitions and future expectations of climatic risks. In doing so, we demonstrate the value of recognising the role of local perceptions of water scarcity (and how they vary between and within households) in constructing social vulnerability. This expanded understanding of risk perception is critical for incentivising individual adaptation and strengthening local adaptation pathways.",0.6533824485937458,0.32969511463903145,0.09139031912856496,0.2251878893518853,0.056966112736105995,0.06436981608304344,0.3279297015269731
Using Social Network Analysis to examine the role that institutional integration plays in community-based adaptive capacity to climate change in Caribbean small island communities,"Remote island communities in the Caribbean are known to be disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. As a result, there is a need to better understand the factors that contribute to increasing local-scale adaptive capacity through large-scale adaptation projects. While it has been argued that strong institutional networks are highly influential in a community's ability to leverage funds and to implement tailored adaptation projects, limited empirical research has been undertaken. Social Network Analysis was used to retrospectively evaluate the importance of institutional integration for enhancing adaptive capacity in the small island community of Paget Farm in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Paget Farm successfully adapted to a lack of fresh water through the implementation of a funded solar-powered desalination plant - and as a result the community represents an ideal case study for analysis. Results reveal that while the level of vertical integration varied throughout the temporal phases of the adaptation project, horizontal integration was consistently low. These findings suggest that high integration between institutions may not be required during all project phases in order to ensure success and that more consistent rather than high levels of integration between sectors may be more meaningful for enhancing adaptive capacity.",0.3832253519223954,0.40493159977329196,0.13392356134670252,0.3469637912827756,0.15969419612830194,0.12058676017640163,0.20178392795029032
The intention of irrigators to adopt water use efficient measures: case studies in the north and south of the Murray-Darling Basin,"As part of water reform in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), water is being reallocated from irrigated agriculture to the environment. The adoption of on-farm water use efficient (WUE) measures is one way irrigators might adapt and remain viable. There has been limited evaluation of the potential of WUE measures for irrigators' adaptation. This paper addresses that gap by bringing together results from a case study in the Southern MDB and published results for the Northern MDB. Responses from irrigator surveys were used to determine the current and future intention to adopt existing WUE measures and then calculate the potential reduction in irrigation water applied. A moderate estimate suggests that about 10% less irrigation water can be applied. What this will mean for entitlement cuts under the Basin Plan will depend on how return flows (i.e. excess irrigation water previously contributing to surface and groundwater) are accounted for. These results suggest that irrigators in the MDB are willing to adapt to some reduction in water availability. This information should contribute to debate about water reform impacts on irrigators and their communities, but those managing the MDB must take into account that on-farm WUE gains may lead to reduced return flows.",0.6316049456389704,0.25566501502046085,0.14893007653791226,0.2361795916262009,0.04873733702113056,0.1444705419626848,0.9302298982216373
Adaptation to the Impacts of Climate Extremes in Central Europe: A Case Study in a Rural Area in the Czech Republic,"The primary objective of this paper is to analyse households' adaptation measures to the impacts of repeated extreme weather events, specifically floods, which belong amongst the most serious manifestation of ongoing climate change in Europe. The case study focuses on a rural area in the north-east part of the Czech Republic, in the catchment basin of the Beva River. A total of 605 households were addressed within the framework of the questionnaire survey. On the basis of the conducted research, we determined that the total amount of adaptation measures adopted by those dwelling in residential homes within the investigated catchment area was relatively low. In contrast, however, one of the most important adaptation measureshouse elevationwas applied by 46.94% of the houses (up to 1 m) and by 21.16% houses (elevated more than 1 m) respectively. We also found that the amount and scope of adaptation measures realized by households were influenced by certain socio-demographic factors of the inhabitants. The most statistically significant factors included households with more residents or families with more children living in the household, as well as those with a higher level of education. Flood experience, the level of damage, and individual flood risk perception also played an important role.",0.4311121897351011,0.3515314662358147,0.09825982292075808,0.37653403412827563,0.08401504692615774,0.19603433936828543,0.27905076932939665
Perceived community-based flood adaptation strategies under climate change in Nepal,"Climate induced natural disasters and extreme events are escalating with the increased variability of climatic parameters due to climate change. This study assesses the flood adaptation strategies that are applicable at the community level in two Terai districts of Nepal. The data were collected through three focus group discussions and 210 household surveys. The study revealed that flood forecasting practices at community level included monitoring the extent of rainfall in upper catchments and identifying the position of clouds. 'Initiate communication', 'take care the affected people', and 'select the appropriate location to stay' were most preferred strategies during the flood. Similarly, 'exchanging helps with each other', 'preparing temporary settlement plan' and 'co-ordinating with government and other agencies' are most preferred post-flood adaptation strategies. Identification and assessment of locally-relevant flood adaptation strategies will help governments to choose adaptation strategies that are both effective and preferred by local people in vulnerable communities.",0.4093012724954962,0.3339957331481,0.12564742220764916,0.45950641560818944,0.16503049846286516,0.20227481580563828,0.4159564736522659
"Watershed degradation and the growing risk of erosion in Hawassa-Zuria District, Southern Ethiopia","Watershed degradation has resulted in high risk of erosion followed by risk of flooding in the lowlands and has become the most livelihoods' threatening factor in Ethiopia in general and in the fragile watersheds of Hawassa Zuria District in particular. The objectives of this study were: (a) to assess farmers' practices of land, water and biomass management in order to improve their livelihoods; (b) to assess the existing risks and interventions and the condition of the watershed; (c) to assess the socio-economic patterns of the farmers in the watershed. A group discussion with different stakeholders, key informant interviews and observational survey through transect walks have been used as methods of data collection. The study result has shown that the most threatening factor of degradation is gully erosion due to vegetation removal from the watershed. About 94% of the farmers used and agreed that they stabilised gullies by physical and biological measures; 60% and 88% of the respondents, respectively have indicated diversion of run-off above the gully and improvement of gully catchments as a means of gully erosion measures and reduce flooding risks in the lowlands. Community awareness creation on natural resource conservation and management as well as resolving tenure disagreements can also play role in gully control and land rehabilitation.",0.8105749842569392,0.2907036204922518,0.172595699104516,0.38868050286949557,0.04399672183339998,0.0947392124419488,0.27662381743551734
DYNAMICS OF INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE AGRICULTURAL ADAPTATION TO WATER SCARCITY,"Drought and water scarcity are growing challenges to agriculture around the world. Farmers can adapt through both individual and community-based collective actions. We draw on extensive field-work conducted with paddy farmers in rural Sri Lanka to study adaptations to water scarcity, including switching to less water-intensive crops, farming collectively on shared land, and individually turning to groundwater by digging wells. We explore how variability in climate affects agricultural decision-making at the community and individual levels using three types of decision-making, each characterized by an objective function: risk-averse expected utility, regret-adjusted expected utility, and prospect theory loss-aversion. We also assess how the introduction of individualized access to irrigation water with wells affects community-based drought mitigation practices. Preliminary results suggest that the growth of well-irrigation may produce sudden disruptions to community-based adaptations, but that this depends on the mental models farmers use to think about risk and make decisions under uncertainty.",0.8850562220151418,0.268276687586561,0.15273841701026092,0.31609748024112355,0.03338295702261328,0.03871097501180835,0.3179391519249182
Integration of expertise or collaborative practice?: Coastal management and climate adaptation at the Wadden Sea,"Collaborative governance has emerged in recent years as a leading paradigm within environmental management more generally and coastal management in particular. The extensive policy and academic literatures on integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) have promoted the coordination of multiple policy sectors, the inclusion of non-state actors as well as the integration of scientific knowledge and expertise from across a diverse range of disciplines. More recently, scholars within this field have called for greater attention to local, lay forms of knowledge and the cultural values held by coastal communities. The potential tensions between these objectives has however, received limited attention to date. To what extent is a concern for collaborative practice and stakeholder inclusion compatible with a similarly ambitious concern for the transdisciplinary integration of expertise? This paper responds to calls for empirical analyses of governance processes at the coast and the need to critically review purported paradigm shifts within the context of broader spatially and temporally differentiated governance contexts. The paper identifies distinct interpretations of ICZM in the literature, reflecting distinct paradigms of planning practice. Empirically, the paper examines the relationship between knowledge integration and collaborative practice through a case study of managing coastal change at the German Wadden Sea coast. In this particular case, expert driven approaches to policy-making, informed by a technical rationality paradigm have been dominant, presenting challenges to the emergence of colla-borative, cross-sectoral governance.",0.11372449887943964,0.41599334600047577,0.12005026517212448,0.1948368911473797,0.3019727730535823,0.4328979141202416,0.16705307409451436
"Local collective action: Adaptation to coastal erosion in the Monkey River Village, Belize","Successful adaptation to environmental change and variability is closely connected with social groups' ability to act collectively, but many social-ecological challenges exceed local adaptive capacity which necessitate assistance from governmental institutions. Few studies have investigated how local collective action can be used to enrol external support for adaptation. This paper reduces this research gap by analysing a locally driven adaptation process in response to coastal erosion in Monkey River Village, Belize. Drawing on literature on adaptation and political ecology, we examine the different strategies Me local residents have used over time to influence government authorities to support them in curbing the coastal erosion. Our findings show that the local mobilisation generated government support for a temporary sea defence and that collective strategies emerge as a response to threats to a place specific way of life. Our case illustrates that it was essential that the villagers could ally with journalists, researchers and local NGOs to make their claims for protection heard by the government. The paper contributes to adaptation research by arguing that local collective action, seen as contestation over rights to protection from environmental change, can be a means for places and communities not prioritised by formal policies to enrol external support for adaptation. Our study supports and adds to the perspective that attention to formal arrangements such as adaptation policy alone has limited explanatory power to understand collective responses to change.

Assessing factors that affect selection of adaptation strategies for small-scale fishing communities,"Climate change is a global phenomenon that impacts nature. One of the impacts is the increase in the earth's surface temperature that increases the sea level and causing a reduction in coastlines. In addition, fishermen's productive physical capital such as vessels, jetties and fishing gear, are vulnerable to the changing climate. Therefore, fishermen need to use adaptation strategies to survive in coastal areas. This study was undertaken in Tambakrejo, Sumbermanjing, Malang. Data were collected using surveys (questionnaires). Their understanding of climate change affects their choice of adaptation strategies. Our findings reveal that fishermen's understanding of climate change, perceived feelings of impacts and their characteristics are important variables when choosing adaptation strategies. Perceived feeling of sea level increases and changes of fish species are significant factors that affect them in selecting adaptation strategies such as create new mangrove area, construction of breakwater and the use of new fishing technologies. The limitation of fishermen's knowledge of climate change should lead to active promotion and education from stakeholders and/or government for successful implementation of any adaptation strategies. © 2018 World Research Association.

Adapting to climate-induced sea level rise on the Gold Coast: lessons from the Netherlands,"Sea level rise poses significant risks to the Gold Coast, which is particularly vulnerable to coastal retreat, inundation and flooding. Drawing on policy transfer literature as the conceptual framework, this paper aims to draw lessons from the Netherlands, as an exemplar of adaptive flood management, to inform the future direction of adaptation to sea level rise on the Gold Coast. On both the Gold Coast and in the Netherlands, the traditional approach taken to adapt to sea level rise has been characterised by a structural approach to protect properties through flood defences. However, the Dutch Government has recently acknowledged the need to adopt a proactive approach to water management and accommodate water through spatial planning initiatives to minimise long-term risk from climate change. From the Dutch experience, three important lessons can be drawn: (1) the need to use spatial planning to accommodate water; (2) the need to adopt a proactive approach to climate adaptation; and (3) the importance of a strong centralised approach to water management. As the current adaptation framework in the Netherlands reflects centuries of experimenting with flood mitigation, these lessons should be of particular interest to Australian planners and policy-makers. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.",0.11137081836969046,0.3310941266928013,0.16678515269328484,0.21267139180885633,0.3947597669882895,0.6152739888160195,0.7415285328072705
"Planned retreat as a management response to coastal risk: a case study from the Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia","Australian coastal areas have been identified as highly vulnerable to climate change, with major projected impacts including sea level rise, extreme weather events, increased erosion, and a change in coastal processes and wave patterns. Such impacts would cause coastal settlements and ecosystems to face increasingly uncertain conditions. In response to increased risk, effective coastal management at local and regional scales is needed, with governing bodies providing significant leadership. This research explores the challenges of applying effective adaptation responses to projected climate change in vulnerable coastal systems on the South Coast of the Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia. In particular, the option of planned retreat as a management response to coastal risk is critically examined, with the incorporation of learning from Byron Bay, NSW. A mixed methods approach was undertaken by integrating documentary interrogation with the analysis of interview responses from key coastal managers. It was determined that despite the increase in adaptation planning and development of management strategy options to manage sea level rise on the Fleurieu Peninsula, there is a lack of implementation of adaptation responses. In addition, planning seems to focus largely on the implications of sea level rise on infrastructure, often overlooking other risks and possible ecological impacts. Inconsistencies in governance are reflected at all levels, indicating a need for comprehensive improvements to ensure the incorporation of appropriate risk responses into planning decisions.",0.0881247798214211,0.39948638525755775,0.11790696302726714,0.10868607125205626,0.7325354522294296,0.5634625250210493,0.16687570752581762
Operationalizing ecosystem-based adaptation: harnessing ecosystem services to buffer communities against climate change,"Ecosystem-based approaches for climate change adaptation are promoted at international, national, and local levels by both scholars and practitioners. However, local planning practices that support these approaches are scattered, and measures are neither systematically implemented nor comprehensively reviewed. Against this background, this paper advances the operationalization of ecosystem-based adaptation by improving our knowledge of how ecosystem-based approaches can be considered in local planning (operational governance level). We review current research on ecosystem services in urban areas and examine four Swedish coastal municipalities to identify the key characteristics of both implemented and planned measures that support ecosystem-based adaptation. The results show that many of the measures that have been implemented focus on biodiversity rather than climate change adaptation, which is an important factor in only around half of all measures. Furthermore, existing measures are limited in their focus regarding the ecological structures and the ecosystem services they support, and the hazards and risk factors they address. We conclude that a more comprehensive approach to sustainable ecosystem-based adaptation planning and its systematic mainstreaming is required. Our framework for the analysis of ecosystem-based adaptation measures proved to be useful in identifying how ecosystem-related matters are addressed in current practice and strategic planning, and in providing knowledge on how ecosystem-based adaptation can further be considered in urban planning practice. Such a systematic analysis framework can reveal the ecological structures, related ecosystem services, and risk-reducing approaches that are missing and why. This informs the discussion about why specific measures are not considered and provides pathways for alternate measures/ designs, related operations, and policy processes at different scales that can foster sustainable adaptation and transformation in municipal governance and planning.",0.1423965150160764,0.350102020686436,0.10779380717737506,0.16838550799884522,0.19000540895675194,0.4324803453816481,0.14149496765219716

'The weather is like the game we play': Coping and adaptation strategies for extreme weather events among ethnic minority groups in upland northern Vietnam,"The Vietnamese government, along with country-based non-government organisations, are well aware of the vulnerability of Vietnam's coastal and low-lying areas to extreme weather events. Yet scant attention has been paid to extreme weather hazards affecting Vietnam's northern mountainous regions and the livelihoods of ethnic minority farmers residing there. Building on conceptual tools from vulnerability, food security and sustainable livelihoods literatures, we examine the impacts of extreme weather, namely drought and severe cold spells, in Vietnam's northern uplands. We explore the degree to which these events impact the livelihood portfolios and food security of ethnic minority farmers, and examine the coping strategies households initiate, based on their ecological knowledge as well as recent market integration initiatives. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with ethnic minority Hmong and Yao semi-subsistence households undertaken yearly from 2012 to 2014, we demonstrate that financial capital - now more central to households' livelihoods than ever before due to state-sponsored agricultural intensification - is an important means for farmers to cope with extreme weather events. Yet concurrently, longstanding culturally rooted social capital, networks and ties remain critical. Nonetheless, short-and long-term adaptation is not widespread, leading us to investigate possible explanations.",0.8113994171485761,0.3681844958489316,0.06663810044862349,0.5335549787706783,0.08769556911810568,0.05427427547284628,0.09687628820779885
Pathways of adaptation to external stressors in coastal natural-resource-dependent communities: Implications for climate change,"Adaptation to climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing coastal communities today. Coastal communities are subject to a wide range of stressors related to climate change, including biological resource decline and natural hazards. Small historically natural-resource-dependent communities are particularly vulnerable because of their close reliance on ecosystem goods and services that are likely to be affected by climate change (e.g., fisheries, forests) and their limited access to outside technical and financial resources needed for adaptation. Exogenous adaptation policies, while helpful for fostering new behavioral adjustments to address resource decline and natural hazards, can in some cases exacerbate socioeconomic disruption, further burdening communities already struggling to adapt. This paper presents an investigation of how six historically natural-resource-dependent coastal communities in Oregon, USA, have experienced and responded to external stressors and how adaptation in these communities has been shaped by interactions between past and present practices, processes, and vulnerabilities. Despite climate-related impacts identified by the scientific community, climate change was not salient in the community members' reports of stressors and impacts, and thus was not a trigger of adaptation. Rather, communities were responding to stressors associated with decades of declines in natural resource industries, an economic recession, restrictive natural resource management and land use policies, demographic change, and natural hazards. These findings confirm other research findings that chronic everyday problems, including those related to the maintenance of livelihoods, or consequences of inadequate livelihoods, often eclipse potentially disastrous threats in the minds of rural community members, thereby influencing adaptation strategies. In some cases communities do not prioritize such threats because people have come to accept living with them, or they feel powerless and unable to change the circumstances of daily life. The findings improve understanding of adaptation in natural-resource based coastal communities in the USA and support the need for policy makers and planners to integrate climate change adaptation into livelihood improvement strategies.

Adaptation strategies to climate change in marine systems,"The world's oceans are highly impacted by climate change and other human pressures, with significant implications for marine ecosystems and the livelihoods that they support. Adaptation for both natural and human systems is increasingly important as a coping strategy due to the rate and scale of ongoing and potential future change. Here, we conduct a review of literature concerning specific case studies of adaptation in marine systems, and discuss associated characteristics and influencing factors, including drivers, strategy, timeline, costs, and limitations. We found ample evidence in the literature that shows that marine species are adapting to climate change through shifting distributions and timing of biological events, while evidence for adaptation through evolutionary processes is limited. For human systems, existing studies focus on frameworks and principles of adaptation planning, but examples of implemented adaptation actions and evaluation of outcomes are scarce. These findings highlight potentially useful strategies given specific social-ecological contexts, as well as key barriers and specific information gaps requiring further research and actions.",0.3991714207464397,0.3562639724133968,0.1689916039179138,0.33050642632664773,0.17992486655915554,0.1025072055160289,0.0666739199278163
Small-island communities in the Philippines prefer local measures to relocation in response to sea-level rise,"Most adaptation studies suggest that sea-level rise will lead to relocation as flooding worsens. Here we identified and evaluated potential adaptation strategies for adapting to sea-level rise, based on the experiences of four low-lying island communities in central Philippines that have experienced flooding during normal high tides since a 2013 earthquake that induced land subsidence. Coastal surveys, interviews and household questionnaires showed that island residents generally prefer in situ adaptation strategies rather than relocation to the mainland. These results are unexpected, particularly because a relocation programme has been developed by authorities on the mainland. Direct measurements during a flooding event indicate stilted housing as the most effective type of adaptation strategy. Many households have also raised their floors using coral stones, although this might inadvertently increase their vulnerability to typhoons and storm surges in the long-term.",0.26593978701916277,0.4095874861808688,0.10734110380656386,0.40304050632601496,0.29329519286141326,0.36606216213627374,0.2756692841126841
Adapting to sea level rise: Emerging governance issues in the San Francisco Bay Region,"San Francisco Bay, the largest estuary on the Pacific Coast of North America, is heavily encroached by a metropolitan region with over 7 million inhabitants. Urban development and infrastructure, much of which built over landfill and at the cost of former baylands, were placed at very low elevations. Sea level rise (SLR) poses a formidable challenge to these highly exposed urban areas and already stressed natural systems. ""Green"", or ecosystem-based, adaptation is already on the way around the Bay. Large scale wetland restoration projects have already been concluded, and further action now often requires articulation with the reinforcement of flood defense structures, given the level of urban encroachment. While levee setback, or removal, would provide greater environmental benefit, the need to protect urban areas and infrastructure has led to the trial of ingenious solutions for promoting wetland resilience while upgrading the level of protection provided by levees. We analyzed the region's environmental governance and planning structure, through direct observation, interviews with stakeholders, and study of planning documents and projects. We present two examples where actual implementation of SLR adaptation has led, or may lead to, the need to revise standards and practices or require uneasy choices between conflicting public interests. Among the region's stakeholders, there is an increasing awareness of the risks related to SLR, but the institutional arrangements are complex, and communication between the different public agencies/departments is not always as streamlined as it could be. Some agencies and departments need to adapt their procedures in order to remove institutional barriers to adaptation, but path dependence is an obstacle. There is evidence that more frank and regular communication between public actors is needed. It also emphasizes the benefits of a coordination of efforts and strategies, something that was eroded in the transition from central-government-led policies to a new paradigm of local-based adaptive governance.",0.10796208408645531,0.34543703261725084,0.14766015938328592,0.2273169059833363,0.12156734081459697,0.6312205078228629,0.2483350524677542
Fostering coastal community resilience: Mobilising people-place relationships,"There are new, and increasing, pressures facing coastal communities, including socio-economic and environmental change, exploitation of resources, urban development and the predicted impacts of climate change. The cumulative and interacting effect of these challenges may result in socio-economic and physical decline. This paper responds to calls for more detailed investigation into coastal regeneration by providing empirical evidence (interviews, observations, policy analysis) on specific coastal resorts on the island of Ireland. In doing so it builds on an emerging area of research that suggests coastal regeneration may be theoretically and practically informed by resilience thinking. The case study findings highlight differing, and sometimes competing values, perceptions and priorities at the local level and highlight the challenges facing striving resorts seeking to find their contemporary identity and enhance their resilience to future change.",0.19941021281823296,0.38250215229480944,0.1146823170547821,0.3185981261518649,0.23839540919416305,0.4596182848431373,0.15209483182149044
Co-development of a climate change decision support framework through engagement with stakeholders,"For a decision support framework (DSF) to enable effective decision-making in climate change adaptation, it is important that stakeholders are involved in its development, in order to ensure that it is usable and useful. More specifically, stakeholder involvement may help to ensure that the DSF better meets user needs and expectations, as well as providing legitimate, relevant and trusted information. Involving users also helps to support social learning and build a community of adaptors. This paper describes a case study in Australia of the development of a DSF, called CoastAdapt, for coastal decision makers to adapt to the impacts of climate change, in particular sea-level rise. We use the IAP2 Spectrum to outline how stakeholders were involved. We also describe the specific activities undertaken in developing the DSF, according to how they contribute to conditions of legitimacy, credibility and saliency suggested in boundary' work. We conclude with some practical suggestions for considering these attributes in development of a DSF, noting that each attribute is important and requires consideration both separately and together.",0.15446128780836907,0.3978015310561481,0.16207624098517853,0.25848103780885373,0.17884551851355637,0.2396983607946264,0.1348969549278799
Built to last? Local climate change adaptation and governance in the Caribbean - The case of an informal urban settlement in Trinidad and Tobago,"Climate Change (CC) increasingly affects cities in low-elevation coastal zones, and households in low-income areas in particular. This article focuses on local CC adaptation and governance in Trinidad and Tobago. First, it investigates the capacity of a poor urban community to adapt to CC, by examining the local impacts of and responses to flooding. Second, based on interviews with a selection of local stakeholders, the article sheds light on the institutional barriers preventing the development and implementation of effective CC adaptation strategies. The data show that households in the case study community experience the impacts of changing climatic conditions, in particular flooding. Households implement a wide range of adaptive measures before, during and after floods. It was revealed that the case study community receives very limited institutional support to withstand flooding. Looking at the different levels of CC adaptation governance in Trinidad and Tobago it can be concluded that although the institutional architecture to support local CC adaptation seems to cover all governance levels, vertical linkages between the various levels have to be strengthened to bridge the gap between community-based and national-level adaptation planning. The main institutional challenges are the lack of coordination and communication between the relevant actors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Coastal homeowners in a changing climate,"As climate changes, coastal homeowners are potentially crucial actors in reducing the risks to property and human life from rising seas and increased hurricane activity. Absent strict, enforceable regulations mandating retrofitting of existing homes or major changes in homeowner insurance requirements, coastal resilience in a changing climate will largely reflect private, voluntary decisions of millions of individuals. However, research is scarce on the extent of structural vulnerabilities among US coastal homes and the mitigation measures that homeowners are taking or plan to take. Research devoted to disaster preparedness routinely neglects the specific actions of homeowners as consumers of structural mitigation products, despite the fact that such mitigation is the most cost-effective means to reduce losses. We attempt to fill this important gap with a new Coastal Homeowner Survey and indices designed to measure structural vulnerabilities and homeowner actions and intentions to address vulnerabilities. We conducted a pilot study of 662 respondents in one of the most frequently exposed US coastal communities, New Hanover County, North Carolina. We find that, on average, homes are minimally protected, with homeowners taking few actions to address structural vulnerabilities and not considering taking further action. We also find that the perceived cost of mitigation cannot sufficiently explain the lack of action, implying that other factors are at play. Subsequent research will use the remaining pilot survey data to analyze correlates of these indices to inform private and public sector stakeholders on how to incentivize risk reduction through structural mitigations.",0.1807712032657229,0.37206233569072183,0.12499246837444213,0.2059987062195646,0.2520517700447405,0.2898021846487795,0.19513935468414678
Household-Level Coastal Adaptation and Its Drivers: A Systematic Case Study Review,"Evidence-based information on household-level adaptation is an important element of integrated management of vulnerable coastal regions. A growing number of empirical studies deal with household-level adaptation at the coast in different regions. This article provides a systematic review of these studies. We analyze studies according to how households in different parts of the world are currently adapting, or how they are intending to adapt, and identify explanatory factors for adaptation behavior and intention. We find that households implement a broad range of adaptation measures and that adaptation behavior is explained by individual factors such as socioeconomic and cognitive variables, experience, and perceived responsibilities. Nonpersonal characteristics have also been used to explain adaptation behavior and intention but have not been extensively investigated. Few studies employ qualitative research methods and use inductive approaches as well as models stemming from behavioral economics. Our findings suggest that coastal risk management policies should communicate the efficacy of household-level adaptation, in addition to information about flood risk, in order to encourage coastal households in their adaptation activities. In this context, we discuss the role of resources and responsibility of households for their adaptation behavior. We describe the lessons learnt and formulate a research agenda on household-level adaptation to coastal flood risk. In practice, coastal risk management policies should further promote individually driven adaptation by integrating it in adaptation strategies and processes.",0.3093459476298282,0.3514783995449143,0.1112209179658241,0.34850026861983313,0.3020770091650263,0.263551332978207,0.2603123519451767
"Growing food, growing a movement: climate adaptation and civic agriculture in the southeastern United States","This article examines the role that civic agriculture in Georgia (US) plays in shaping attitudes, strategies, and relationships that foster both sustainability and adaptation to a changing climate. Civic agriculture is a social movement that attracts a specific type of ""activist"" farmer, who is linked to a strong social network that includes other farmers and consumers. Positioning farmers' practices within a social movement broadens the understanding of adaptive capacity beyond how farmers adapt to understand why they do so. By drawing upon qualitative and quantitative data and by focusing on the cosmological, organizational, and technical dimensions of the social movement, the study illuminates how social values and networks shape production and marketing strategies that enable farmers to share resources and risks. We propose a conceptual framework for understanding how technical and social strategies aimed to address the sustainability goals of the movement also increase adaptive capacity at multiple timescales. In conclusion, we outline directions for future research, including the need for longitudinal studies that focus on consumer motivation and willingness to pay, the effects of scale on consumer loyalty and producer cooperation, and the role of a social movement in climate change adaptation. Finally, we stress that farmers' ability to thrive in uncertain climate futures calls for transformative approaches to sustainable agriculture that support the development of strong social networks.",0.7234799012442091,0.3552292644445343,0.15217539734038227,0.5,0.04197653285891964,0.043423952306403606,0.06104794209654072
Climate change impacts on health and wellbeing in rural and remote regions across Canada: a synthesis of the literature,"This article provides a synthesis of the forthcoming first order draft of the Canadian Government's National Assessment on Climate Change 'Rural and Remote' chapter, highlighting key health concerns from the literature associated with climate change in rural and remote regions, as well as existing and future adaptation strategies.

Numerous strategies but limited implementation guidance in US local adaptation plans,"Adaptation planning offers a promising approach for identifying and devising solutions to address local climate change impacts. Yet there is little empirical understanding of the content and quality of these plans. We use content analysis to evaluate 44 local adaptation plans in the United States and multivariate regression to examine how plan quality varies across communities. We find that plans draw on multiple data sources to analyse future climate impacts and include a breadth of strategies. Most plans, however, fail to prioritize impacts and strategies or provide detailed implementation processes, raising concerns about whether adaptation plans will translate into on-the-ground reductions in vulnerability. Our analysis also finds that plans authored by the planning department and those that engaged elected officials in the planning process were of higher quality.

Civil society organizations and adaptation to the health effects of climate change in Canada,"Background: Adaptation will be necessary to cope with the impacts of climate change on the health of Canadians. Civil society organizations (CSOs) have an important role in health adaptation, but it is unknown what actions they are undertaking. Objectives: To identify and examine what adaptations are being developed by CSOs to adapt to the health effects of climate change based on a systematic review of the activities of 190 organizations and 1196 reported adaptation actions. Results: There were six key findings: (1) health adaptation actions are predominantly led by environmental CSOs; (2) most actions are occurring at national and regional levels; (3) food and/or water contamination and air quality are dominant climate change stimuli for action; (4) responses predominantly reflect awareness and research activities, with limited evidence of substantive intervention; (5) consideration of vulnerable groups is limited; and (6) climate change is usually considered alongside other factors, if at all. Conclusions: The results indicate a deficit in terms of what needs to be done for health adaptation and what is being done; part of a broader adaptation deficit in Canada. Coordinated adaptation planning at federal and provincial level is needed, involving collaboration between CSOs and public health bodies. (C) 2013 The Royal Society for Public Health.

Holding Back the Storm: Target Populations and State Climate Adaptation Planning in America,"This paper investigates the landscape of state-level adaptation planning in the United States. We answer three primary research questions: First, how are states planning for climate change? Second, who are states targeting for climate adaptation? Third, what tools are states using to motivate climate adaptation efforts? We develop and implement a coding scheme using Schneider and Ingram's Social Construction Framework (SCF) to characterize variation in 2033 individual adaptation goals mentioned in all 14 American states with explicit adaptation plans. We use these data to understand the types of tools used to motivate different actors (governmental, private, nonprofit) to adapt to climate change. We find that the most frequent target of state adaptation planning is the state itself, which provides an opportunity to extend the SCF to a target group often not mentioned in public policy. Specifically, we find that states target themselves with mandates or tools designed to acquire information. Other stakeholders in adaptation are more likely to be the targets of capacity building tools. Private actors are the only population more likely to be targeted by incentives. The project expands the Social Construction Framework to include targets and tools of planning efforts. Practically, our article offers a methodology by which to compare the vastly heterogeneous efforts to adapt to climate change at the subnational level.",0.1227996690674949,0.4205716472067728,0.19257357651113385,0.22678196757085045,0.10794687156188022,0.2915181881322748,0.10403427098693209
Linkages between human health and ocean health: a participatory climate change vulnerability assessment for marine mammal harvesters,"Background. Indigenous residents of Alaska's Bering Strait Region depend, both culturally and nutritionally, on ice seal and walrus harvests. Currently, climate change and resultant increases in marine industrial development threaten these species and the cultures that depend on them. Objective. To document: (a) local descriptions of the importance of marine mammal hunting; (b) traditional methods for determining if harvested marine mammals are safe to consume; and (c) marine mammal outcomes that would have adverse effects on community health, the perceived causes of these outcomes, strategies for preventing these outcomes and community adaptations to outcomes that cannot be mitigated. Design. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with 82 indigenous hunters and elders from the Bering Strait region. Standard qualitative analysis was conducted on interview transcripts, which were coded for both inductive and deductive codes. Responses describing marine mammal food safety and importance are presented using inductively generated categories. Responses describing negative marine mammal outcomes are presented in a vulnerability framework, which links human health outcomes to marine conditions. Results. Project participants perceived that shipping noise and pollution, as well as marine mammal food source depletion by industrial fishing, posed the greatest threats to marine mammal hunting traditions. Proposed adaptations primarily fell into 2 categories: (a) greater tribal influence over marine policy; and (b) documentation of traditional knowledge for local use. This paper presents 1 example of documenting traditional knowledge as an adaptation strategy: traditional methods for determining if marine mammal food is safe to eat. Conclusions. Participant recommendations indicate that 1 strategy to promote rural Alaskan adaptation to climate change is to better incorporate local knowledge and values into decision-making processes. Participant interest in documenting traditional knowledge for local use also indicates that funding agencies could support climate change adaptation by awarding more grants for tribal research that advances local, rather than academic, use of traditional knowledge.",0.4267741583103445,0.4388711462626662,0.1339601465578449,0.38019726620018796,0.2860771855457734,0.06834510985480556,0.06103084301031903
"Scientists, managers, and assisted colonization: Four contrasting perspectives entangle science and policy","Assisted colonization is a contentious climate change adaptation strategy, but we have limited understanding of the bases of disagreement amongst scientists and far less has been done to understand the views of other stakeholders. To establish an initial empirical understanding of the terms of the debate, we conducted a Q method study of the views of scientists and resource managers, a key constituency because of their role in decision-making and implementation. We asked 24 forest managers in Ontario, Canada and 26 top-publishing ecologists and conservation biologists to evaluate their level of agreement with 33 statements about assisted colonization from the published literature and other relevant sources. The analysis revealed four main, contrasting perspectives, which we label Ecological Interventionist, Nativist Technocrat, Interventionist Technocrat, and Reluctant Interventionist; all but the Nativist Technocrats were open to assisted colonization. Disagreements between the four perspectives were defined by value-based and policy-strategic considerations at least as much as they were by varied understandings of technical issues. Assisted colonization as a climate adaptation strategy exists within the context of multiple competing and incompatible problem definitions even amongst these technical stakeholders. Based upon our findings and the relevant literature, we conclude that disputes surrounding assisted colonization will likely not be settled by additional scientific research. Rather, underlying non-technical considerations need to be brought to the fore and addressed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"ECOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTY, ADAPTATION, AND MITIGATION IN THE US SKI RESORT INDUSTRY: MANAGING RESOURCE DEPENDENCE AND INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES","We draw on resource dependence and institutional theories to study how firms manage uncertainty in nature (ecological uncertainty) in the U.S. ski resort industry. Through resource dependence theory, we develop the concept of ecological uncertainty and explain its effects on firms' access to and management of natural resources. We then predict that firms adapt to ecological uncertainty with natural-resource-intensive practices, as well as practices that attempt to mitigate its underlying causes. Using institutional theory, we also predict that environmental expectations moderate these responses. Our results indicate that firms did manage ecological uncertainty by adopting natural-resource-intensive practices, but not mitigation practices. They also show that stronger environmental expectations constrained firms from adopting natural-resource-intensive practices and promoted their adoption of mitigation practices in response to ecological uncertainty.

"Adaptation through bricolage: Indigenous responses to long-term social-ecological change in the Saskatchewan River Delta, Canada","Adaptation par le bricolage : les reponses des Autochtones aux changements socioecologiques a long terme dans le delta de la riviere Saskatchewan, au Canada Social and ecological change in Canada's north challenges Indigenous communities to develop responses that secure the continuation of their livelihoods. Although there is significant evidence that effective response and adaptation opportunities exist in Indigenous communities, understanding of how such locally developed adaptations are constructed remains limited. This paper develops and applies the concept of bricolage to demonstrate how Indigenous societies build their adaptive capacity to address long-term social-ecological change. Our concept bridges institutional and productive forms of bricolage to explain how individuals and households make conscious decisions and adjustments to retain their livelihoods. The results of long-term engagement with residents of Cumberland House, Saskatchewan through field observations, oral histories, and semi-structured interviews demonstrate that Indigenous peoples improvise, hybridize, contest, and negotiate existing practices to create different kinds of adaptive arrangements. We find, further, that whereas certain livelihood practices have changed, cultural norms such as respect and reciprocity have remained. Our findings strengthen the argument that Indigenous peoples are well-positioned to take direct roles in adaptation; hence, decision makers should consider them equal partners in adaptation decisions and learn from locally developed responses to focus adaptation planning on the relevant needs of Indigenous communities.",0.4917379887238382,0.4922589830866156,0.24984898536764097,0.4500142123368262,0.11725027673963342,0.04941333039902634,0.12316889770996824
Heterogeneous Perceptions of Social-Ecological Change Among Small-Scale Fishermen in the Central Gulf of California: Implications for Adaptive Response,"As changes in climate, governance, and organization reshape the dynamics of small-scale fisheries around the globe, the persistence of many local livelihoods appears contingent upon the ability of resource users to respond and adapt. Though significant scholarship has considered the limiting roles of resources and infrastructure, recent research has highlighted the importance of local learning and knowledge. Rather than being driven by forces exogenous to local communities, it is increasingly recognized that adaptation may be limited by perceptions and processes within them. Here, we explore knowledge production and adaptive response within a small-scale fishery in the central Gulf of California following system perturbation. Using mixed methods from the natural and social sciences, we (1) identify local drivers of social-ecological change, (2) document knowledge concerning their causes and consequences across a diverse group of small-scale fishermen, and (3) identify patterns of intracultural agreement and disagreement associated with divergent adaptive response. Results indicate that perceptions of social-ecological change were heterogeneous and that gear ownership and target species diversification were critical factors in determining the cultural models through which fishermen understood and responded to changes in the resource system. Unlike other user groups, owner-operator fishermen pursuing generalist livelihood strategies held consensus beliefs regarding changes to system structure and function and demonstrated increased ability to modify fishing tactics with the best practices for sustainable use. Our findings highlight how local knowledge can be used to assess the proximate impacts of external drivers of change and provide insight into the cultural models influencing in situ decision-making and adaptive response within modern fishery systems.",0.7592285099242966,0.4093029387240147,0.17300447187117937,0.41874867916027925,0.42746824075513873,0.04238522545164871,0.10174931095625721
Determinants of adoption of drought adaptations among vegetable growers in Florida,"In the United States, Florida ranks second among states for both value and land area of vegetable production, but this production is affected by periodic droughts. Florida has experienced at least one severe and widespread drought every decade since 1900, and climate change projections show that meteorological droughts will occur more often in the future. While drought and climate change affect the supply side, population growth is expected to affect the demand side of water availability. Given these threats to future water availability, the adoption of drought adaptation and water conservation measures is of increasing importance in Florida. Using a 2013 survey of Florida vegetable growers, this paper addresses two main components of this problem. First, we assess the current rates of adoption of drought adaptation measures. Second, we analyze which factors influence or impede the adoption of these measures to provide policy recommendations to increase adoption in the future. We find low rates of adoption of adaptations, ranging from 13% to 55%, and factors determining who adopts a given adaptation vary by adaptation. Factors can have opposite effects on the probability of adoption across different adaptations. Unlike most previous work, we find that growers with more education have lower rates of adoption of water augmentation measures, and lack of land ownership does not necessarily impede adoption of adaptations with large initial investment.",0.8579207919932414,0.24849352709495845,0.13844580630587117,0.3361119035576753,0.03317084259147235,0.060408889573406344,0.30841569629700705
"Flood concerns and impacts on rural landowners: An empirical study of the Deerfield watershed, MA (USA)","Riverine flooding is the most common and costly natural hazard. While there has been substantial research on the perception and management of flood risk among urban and agricultural landowners, we have little knowledge about the ways different groups of rural landowners are impacted by and manage floods. To address this gap, we investigate the impacts of flooding on rural landowners in Massachusetts, USA, the actions they have taken to protect their property, and the ways these concerns and actions vary by land use. We show that floods impact rural landowners in ways that are directly linked to the rural context of their land and livelihoods. Rural landowners face multiple flood risks that include damage to the land itself and rural infrastructure as well as to residential structures. The ways landowners use their land can influence the ways they experience floods and the specific concerns they hold about flood damages. Further, many of these landowners often utilize flood management strategies that involve physical manipulation of riparian areas. Our findings draw attention to the unique context of rural flooding. We argue that more research is needed to understand how these experiences and other factors drive landowners' perspectives on flood management and how these perspectives and management activities influence the practice of flood management at the basin-scale.",0.26422440329757446,0.3632131700285742,0.18633042387120358,0.3455783253070473,0.0982362466568851,0.343929627137869,0.6104760996717367
Reliable Knowledge and Habits of the Mind: Factors Inhibiting and Facilitating Farmers' Adaptations to Energy Constraints,"Instantiated patterns of oil-based energy use have been difficult to change across sectors and societies. Although faced with price increases, diminishing supplies, and climate externalities, many sectors still depend on oil-based energy and have not fully adapted to changing resource conditions. Using a theoretical approach of institutional change, we offer a fine-grained analysis of factors limiting and facilitating energy adaptations. In this case study of farmers in Maine, we identify patterns in their perceptions of the macro-energy environment, adaptation strategies, and anticipated energy challenges. We segment the farms into groups representing small diversified farms and larger commodity farms, and investigate within and across farm sectors to understand farmer strategies for responding to changing energy prices. Significant differences in customs and beliefs, perceptions, and intended institutional changes are found between the small diversified and the larger commodity farms. The ability of farms within these sectors to successfully integrate positive institutional change will determine their possibility to evolve as sustainable enterprises.",0.6531403926498103,0.26253437122347445,0.16879554667982755,0.33070661122643025,0.06942611617287017,0.06459321831010466,0.06130322576853488
"Practitioners, priorities, plans, and policies: assessing climate change adaptation actions in a Canadian community","There is a paucity of research that evaluates climate change adaptation actions. Academics partnered with the City of Prince George, in Northern British Columbia, Canada, for over five years to explore and address adaptation. After an adaptation strategy was created, eight initiatives oriented towards implementation were pursued. These initiatives focused on incorporating adaptation into local plans, and in-depth explorations of impacts related to forests, river flooding and effects to transportation infrastructure. This article summarizes the initiatives pursued and assesses their effectiveness through semi-structured interviews with local planners, engineers, managers, community champions and politicians. The initiatives deemed to be most successful-and most likely to continue after the project has ended-focus on topics that: are of high public concern; have clear cost implications; incorporate adaptation into policy; and/or promote tangible outcomes. Results highlight both benefits and drawbacks associated with 'mainstreaming' adaptation into existing plans and strategies, and the importance of building and maintaining internal capacity.",0.194049023017944,0.38668156259907416,0.15252099914891426,0.230909641392801,0.0928728126365674,0.3434964456207886,0.14411450550018268
The Emergence of Flood Insurance in Canada: Navigating Institutional Uncertainty,"Flood insurance has remained unavailable in Canada based on an assessment that it lacks economic viability. In response to Canada's costliest flood event to date in 2013, the Canadian insurance industry has started to develop a framework to expand existing property insurance to cover flood damage. Research on flood insurance has overlooked why and how insurance systems transition to expand insurance coverage without evidence of economic viability. This article will address this gap through a case study on the emergence of flood insurance in Canada, and the approach to its expansion. Between 2013 and 2016, insurance industry officials representing over 60% of premiums collected in Canada were interviewed. These interviews revealed that flood insurance is being expanded in response to institutional pressure, specifically external stakeholder expectations that the insurance industry will adopt a stronger role in managing flood risk through coverage of flood damage. Further evidence of this finding is explored by assessing the emergence of a unique flood insurance model that involves a risk-adjusted and optional product along with an expansion of government policy supporting flood risk mitigation. This approach attempts to balance industry concerns about economic viability with institutional pressure to reduce flood risk through insurance. This analysis builds on existing research by providing the first scholarly analysis of flood insurance in Canada, important empirical teeth to existing conceptual analysis on the availability of flood insurance, and the influence of institutional factors on risk analysis within the insurance sector.",0.09922692428514591,0.3539775282361891,0.12192685303562893,0.2450028152559538,0.15074129112673126,0.5506635919630428,0.6306216980121125
"Place-based climate change adaptation: A critical case study of climate change messaging and collective action in Churchill, Manitoba","Climate change adaptation frameworks often emphasize tangible community vulnerabilities, but typically fail to recognize that healthy, vibrant, and resilient communities are also based on many factors that are experiential in nature. In response to the continued undervaluation of such factors, scholars are adopting place identity and place attachment as a way to explore the risks of climate change in a more holistic manner. This study draws on Churchill, Manitoba's unique relationship with climate change to present an early examination of place-based climate change adaptation. Results from a community survey suggest that citizens' sensitivity to local climate impacts is associated most strongly with their connection to the social meanings that are embedded in the natural landscape. Results also indicate that this place driven sensitivity does not necessarily lead to an increase in actions to adapt to climate change. It is suggested that inaction in the face of climate change can persist, even when citizens' have a strong connection to place, particularly because dominant climate change communications fail to produce a socially salient message. By linking place-based adaptation research to an emerging value-based frame for climate adaptation, this study presents new pathways to help legitimize local values in climate change adaptation processes, and to create frames for communication that are more conducive to fostering collective action.

"Forest Management for Climate Change in New England and the Klamath Ecoregions: Motivations, Practices, and Barriers","Understanding perceptions and attitudes of forest managers toward climate change and climate adaptive forest management is crucial, as they are expected to implement changes to forest resource management. We assessed the perceptions of forest managers toward climate adaptive forest management practices through a survey of forest managers working in private firms and public agencies in New England and the Klamath ecoregion (northern California and southwestern Oregon). We analyzed the motivations, actions, and potential barriers to action of forest managers toward climate adaptive forest management practices. Results suggest that managing for natural regeneration is the most common climate adaptive forest management approach considered by forest managers in both regions. Lack of information about the best strategies for reducing climate change risks, lack of education and awareness among the clients, and perceived client costs were forest managers' primary barriers to climate adaptive management. Our findings suggest useful insights toward the policy and program design in climate adaptive forest management for both areas.",0.4858212231289726,0.2713188174438455,0.38122159633597064,0.2108680344702968,0.04233268226137857,0.03787228603532563,0.03960780668321059
Predictors of visitors' climate-related coping behaviors in a nature-based tourism destination,"Climate change affects the supply of nature-based tourism opportunities as well as the demand visitors place on those opportunities. Climate-induced changes in visitor demand, specifically climate-related coping behaviors (e.g., seeking safer recreation sites, changing trip timing, using weather forecasts to plan trips), are influenced by multiple factors such as season of visit, specific visitor attributes, and general climate change beliefs and concern. Understanding the relationships between visitor characteristics and coping behaviors within the context of a changing climate will help recreation managers and tourism providers anticipate shifts in demand and adapt strategically. In this study, we present results from a series of binary logistic regression models of summer and winter visitor survey data to examine climate-related coping behaviors within a regional nature-based tourism area (the North Shore region of Lake Superior in Minnesota). Findings reveal that winter recreationists, younger visitors, and visitors who are concerned about climate change, are most inclined to use behavioral coping in response to changing climate and environmental conditions. Specifically, we found that winter season recreationists are much more likely to report having experienced a past climate-related impact, and that weather information, alternative gear, and flexibility in timing their trips are important in overcoming these constraints. Further, younger visitors were more likely to use informational (weather forecast) coping, site substitution, and activity substitution to respond to climate-related impacts. This study expands upon climate-related recreation and tourism research by documenting how recreationists' informational, spatial, and temporal coping behaviors vary across visitor characteristics. Further research is needed to determine if the behavioral coping preferences and patterns found in this study emerge across diverse contexts. However, our findings here can help managers begin to strategically plan and collaborate to maintain destination-level attractiveness to visitors despite changing environmental conditions. Management implications: Understanding how visitors respond to environmental changes is important in sustaining 'weather-resistant' visitor flows. In anticipation of on-site disruptions and future demand shifts, regional partnerships within nature-based destinations may mitigate reductions in visitor demand and accommodate shifting patterns in visitor flows. For example, recreation managers and tourism providers could identify and jointly market alternative recreation opportunities when conditions are not conducive to participating in desired activities, as well as develop a networked approach for communicating weather and site safety information.",0.25477729793349824,0.33677471848225893,0.15885353845167402,0.25491922326804306,0.06065038865202781,0.054739885792703245,0.061779591738248756
The Relationship Between Climate Change Policy and Socioeconomic Changes in the US Great Plains,"As the United States struggles with national solutions to climate change, state and local governments have increasingly taken policy action in this area. Although existing research addresses why some places adopt climate change policy while others do not, much of this expresses policies as a function of factors in the present period or recent past, leaving the question of whether current climate change policy can be seen as a lagged response to longer term trends largely unaddressed. Examination of climate change policy as a response to longer term changes expands the existing understanding of why locations choose to be active in this area. Pairing unique climate change policy survey data from more than 200 local Great Plains governments with Census and environmental data from 1990 to 2000, this article examines whether changes in local socioeconomic and environmental factors in the 1990s are associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation policy adoption from the following decade, 2000-2010.",0.3414267611338009,0.35451301905942856,0.12616143073991254,0.3188789637499424,0.06229050857300989,0.11646445150384938,0.10934530649288109
Planning for Climate Change Adaptation in Natural Resources Management: Challenges to Policy-Making in the US Great Plains,"In contrast to the national-level policies found in most developed nations, in the USA, sub-national governments have emerged as leaders in formulating climate change policy. Yet participation is uneven, and little is understood about why some act and others do not. This paper examines two sets of factors for their influence on climate change adaptation planning in communities of the Great Plains. Using survey data collected from a range of natural resources managers in 900+ jurisdictions in 12 states, the study examines the impact of perceived barriers to climate change planning and the natural environment on the probability that jurisdictions will engage in adaptation planning. The findings show that most jurisdictions remain sceptical of climate change and see no need to engage in adaptation planning. Among those that have begun to plan or have a plan in place already, the strongest influence comes from changes in the physical environment itself.",0.24469992378598168,0.3494629605078429,0.12506405942737858,0.26755973253442533,0.15025768697524303,0.3124435515588469,0.11836708835781341
"Learning, participation, and adaptation: exploring agri-environmental programmes","This paper explores the perceptions of policy makers and rural agricultural producers in respect of policy framing and adaptation to climate change, social learning and stakeholder input (participation) surrounding two successful agri-environmental programmes in Saskatchewan, Canada. Given the record of success of these two programmes in reducing vulnerability to climate change, this study provides an opportunity to explore certain attributes of adaptive management, including: what attributes make policy and programmes responsive; how government can frame programmes facilitating adaptation to climate change; what types of mechanisms can or should be used to engage with producers; and perhaps most importantly, what producers expect of government, government policies and programmes in relation to adaptation to climate change.",0.5205445147144112,0.345069959040611,0.15353067986293006,0.35534965853653705,0.06072289877522788,0.08733439073148744,0.1269044917158073

Educating with resilience in mind: Addressing climate change in post-Sandy New York City,"How educators adapt their programs following a climate related disturbance can provide insights into potential climate education practices. Therefore; we used semi-structured interviews to explore changes in environmental education practice in NYC following Hurricane Sandy. Educators adopted new language to reflect funding, opportunities and incorporated new practices and collaborations, including those focused on resilience. Educators' resilience practices reflected the psychological, community, ecological; and social-ecological systems resilience academic literature. Overall practice changes appeared to be adaptive, although some educators reflected more deeply about transforming their practice.

Implications of Regulatory Drought for farmer Use of Climate Information in the Klamath Basin,"Despite the risk of climate variability to agriculture, farmer use of climate information in agricultural decision-making generally remains low. Research has suggested that where farmers already have robust ""repertoires'' of decision-making resources adapted to some degree of climate variability, such new information may simply factor less saliently. This study asks whether farmer use of climate information increases under the occurrence of more extreme climatic events for which those repertoires lack referent-in this case, severe hydrological and related regulatory drought in the Klamath basin. Semistructured interviews with key informants of Klamath basin agriculture indicate a marked increase in farmer use of climate and climate-related information since the onset of drought in 2001. What information farmers utilize, however, depends on whether it retains its predictive and explanatory value under both types of drought. Findings highlight the need for consideration of coproduction approaches to the development of climate information if it is to serve farmers where the extremity of climate events produces changes not only in availability of but also in access to key agricultural resources.",0.8899663021008911,0.17763326004434085,0.08958854417852437,0.4148506040233602,0.02844329664992493,0.03183884875930567,0.05956240634664922
Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change: A National Experiment in Manager-Scientist Partnerships to Apply an Adaptation Framework,"Forest managers in the United States must respond to the need for climate-adaptive strategies in the face of observed and projected climatic changes. However, there is a lack of on-the-ground forest adaptation research to indicate what adaptation measures or tactics might be effective in preparing forest ecosystems to deal with climate change. Natural resource managers in many areas are also challenged by scant locally or regionally relevant information on climate projections and potential impacts. The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project was designed to respond to these barriers to operationalizing climate adaptation strategies by providing a multiregion network of replicated opeiational-scale research sites testing ecosystem-specific climate change adaptation treatments across a gradient of adaptive approaches, and introducing conceptual tools and processes to integrate climate change considerations into management and silvicultural decisionmaking.

Implications of climate change for shipping: Ports and supply chains,"Ports are an important economic actor-at local, national, and international scales-that have been identified as being vulnerable to future changes to the climate. This paper details the findings from an international review of state-of-the-art knowledge concerning climate risks, and adaptation responses, for ports and their supply chains. Evidence from both academic and gray literature indicates that there has already been major damage and disruption to ports across the world from climate-related hazards and that such impacts are projected to increase in the years and decades to come. Findings indicate that while a substantial-and growing-body of scientific evidence on coastal risks and potential adaptation options is acting as a stimulus for port authorities to explicitly consider the risks for their assets and operations, only a notable few have actually made the next step toward implementing adaptation strategies. This paper concludes by putting forward constructive recommendations for the sector and suggestions for research to address remaining knowledge gaps. It emphasizes a call for collaboration between the research and practice communities, as well as the need to engage a broad range of stakeholders in the adaptation planning process.

Adaptations to extreme storm events by conservation organizations,"Extreme precipitation events are associated with increased runoff of sediment and nutrients into surface waters, exacerbating water quality problems and creating challenges for soil and water managers. This change in the hydrologic cycle is expected to intensify under future climate change. Soil and water conservation professionals responsible for advising farmers and other land managers are on the front lines of adaptation to these climate change impacts. This study uses a survey of Soil and Water Conservation District staff (n=260) in the United States Upper Midwest to better understand adaptation planning and implementation and the factors influencing adaptations by public organizations. In contrast to a typical planning-implementation gap finding, our respondents report a greater emphasis on some kinds of adaptation actions over planning. We find that the concerns of individual government employees about climate change have a greater association with adaptation planning strategies (e.g., planning document updates) compared to implemented adaptations on-the-ground (e.g., stream bufferinstallation). Also, weather projections were being used in conjunction with both adaptation planning and implementation. This study contributes to efforts to open up the black box of adaptation decision-making in the public sector, revealing the important role of individual concerns and information use.",0.37881879914715727,0.3293182701251848,0.3060993000625482,0.12270858584792017,0.06181537604644983,0.18969799943691332,0.19802344758381776
The interfaces of public and private adaptation: Lessons from flooding in the Deerfield River Watershed,"Successful adaptation to climate risks will depend on the outcomes of many coordinated and uncoordinated actions. Key will be ensuring public and private adaptations undertaken at a variety of scales do not undermine one another. To improve understandings of how adaptive responses accumulate, we investigate interactions between public and private efforts to mitigate flood hazards in the Deerfield River Watershed, located in Western Massachusetts, USA. Through interviews, we uncover the manner in which private adaptations, undertaken by landowners seeking to protect their land from flood impacts, are both determined in response to and have an effect on public adaptations seeking to address flood impacts across the watershed. Landowners respond to public adaptations based on their perceptions of the appropriateness of adaptive pathways including how they view the effectiveness of adaptive action and how the actions fit with the social contract. As a result, the interface between public and private adaptations takes various forms: commutable, attenuating, synergistic, or countervailing. Our findings underscore how, in areas with high geo-physical connectivity and where responsibility. is dispersed across private and public entities, anticipating and responding to multiple interfaces between public and private adaptations is needed for public adaptations to achieve the best cumulative outcomes.

Coverage and framing of climate change adaptation in the media: A review of influential North American newspapers during 1993-2013,"The portrayal of climate change in the news has been a major focus of research over the last decade, reflecting the importance of the media in affecting public opinion and policy. This work has primarily focused on the science of climate change, impacts, and mitigation, yet our understanding on how adaptation is being profiled in the media is limited. In response to this gap, this paper quantitatively examines the coverage and framing of climate change adaptation in four influential North American newspapers between 1993 and 2013. Over the observation period, the total number of articles focusing on adaptation published each year increases, with peaks in reporting in 2007, 2012, and 2013. While adaptation has permeated news coverage, it still remains overshadowed by stories on impacts and mitigation, with increased reporting consistent with increased media attention to climate change over the last two decades. Of the newspaper articles with adaptation content (n = 271), the majority (53%) focus primarily on stating the need to adapt, as opposed to documenting actual preparations being undertaken for adaptation or profiling actual adaptations that have taken place. The types of adaptation being reported on are predominantly 'hard' in nature, profiling techno-engineering based responses to reduce potential climate change impacts, in contrast to 'soft' responses that seek to enhance resilience. This representation is particularly evident in reporting in 2012 and 2013. Adaptations being described in the selected newspaper articles are primarily anticipatory in nature up until 2011, after which adaptations are primarily discussed in terms of responding to extreme weather events, specifically in the context of a surge in reporting documented in response to Hurricane Sandy (2012) and flooding in Canada in 2013.

Do-it-yourself (DIY) adaptation: Civic initiatives as drivers to address climate change at the urban scale,"Greening projects lead by civic actors at the urban scale spur transformation through example and through gradual adjustment of processes. Questions remain on how such projects are put into action and on what make them work. How do civic experiments reflect the ongoing change in urban governance and practices? We focus on a qualitative study of two greening initiatives lead by civic groups in Quebec City (Quebec, Canada). The case studies are analysed through the lens of theories that approach civic action and climate experiments as new modes of urban governance. We conclude that civil society groups have the capacity to intervene directly on the urban environment in order to enhance its quality. Findings reveal that informal greening initiatives contribute to a civic narrative in favour of adaptation to climate change at the local scale.",0.1440946275328813,0.3597110200350535,0.14787167885574634,0.2865058095374382,0.0709099869356218,0.6554476727139734,0.19205715879468138
Strategies to Reduce the Harmful Effects of Extreme Heat Events: A Four-City Study,"Extreme heat events (EHEs) are becoming more intense, more frequent and longer lasting in the 21st century. These events can disproportionately impact the health of low-income, minority, and urban populations. To better understand heat-related intervention strategies used by four U.S. cities, we conducted 73 semi-structured interviews with government and non-governmental organization leaders representing public health, general social services, emergency management, meteorology, and the environmental planning sectors in Detroit, MI; New York City, NY; Philadelphia, PA and Phoenix, AZ-cities selected for their diverse demographics, climates, and climate adaptation strategies. We identified activities these leaders used to reduce the harmful effects of heat for residents in their city, as well as the obstacles they faced and the approaches they used to evaluate these efforts. Local leaders provided a description of how local context (e. g., climate, governance and city structure) impacted heat preparedness. Despite the differences among study cities, political will and resource access were critical to driving heat-health related programming. Upon completion of our interviews, we convened leaders in each city to discuss these findings and their ongoing efforts through day-long workshops. Our findings and the recommendations that emerged from these workshops could inform other local or national efforts towards preventing heat-related morbidity and mortality.",0.0913408104552714,0.5281228724738585,0.08890234100847702,0.1805678418473658,0.05184998356954678,0.5509675185321717,0.07862317238980084

Climate change and Canadian community grass-based sport fields,"This study examines adaptations being completed by those maintaining municipal grass-based sports fields during times of climate change. A total of sixteen in-depth interviews were conducted from May to July 2016. A semistructured interview guide was utilized. The questions aimed to determine the awareness and impact of changing weather conditions or the problem of climate change, including the priority of the problem, and weather information sources. As well, the questions sought understandings on the strategies for adapting/mitigating for the issue of climate change. All interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim for analysis. Content analysis of the data was utilized, and, specifically, all data were analyzed and categorized by topics, key themes, and/or central questions offered for interpretation. The interview participant selection involved purposeful sampling. The participants held a variety of key employment positions that included directors, senior managers, managers, and key maintenance personnel of departments such as Parks and Recreation, Open Spaces, Parks Operations, Community Facilities, Program Standards, and Parks Maintenance. Each participant was provided a code name, including Participant–1 (P–1) to Participant–16 (P–16). The participants were from the area known as the Golden Horseshoe region, ranging from Niagara Falls to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Municipal workers are making adaptations to maintain grass-based sports fields due to changing weather conditions that could be related to climate change. These impacts involved two key areas: seasons that were not normal as well as new pests and disease. The participants outlined their adaptations, which involved five key sport field maintenance themes. Importantly, a central question was raised as a debate topic for establishing the future directions for grass-based sports fields in times of climate change. © Common Ground, Cheryl Mallen and Greg Dingle, All Rights Reserved",0.5255913123329791,0.3565075354525598,0.16157772949877772,0.30733456852560426,0.06143057879874417,0.09117806203783882,0.05718352871131869
Upper Midwest Climate Variations: Farmer Responses to Excess Water Risks,"Persistent above average precipitation and runoff and associated increased sediment transfers from cultivated ecosystems to rivers and oceans are due to changes in climate and human action. The US Upper Midwest has experienced a 37% increase in precipitation (1958-2012), leading to increased crop damage from excess water and off-farm loss of soil and nutrients. Farmer adaptive management responses to changing weather patterns have potential to reduce crop losses and address degrading soil and water resources. This research used farmer survey (n = 4778) and climate data (1971-2011) to model influences of geophysical context, past weather, on-farm flood and saturated soils experiences, and risk and vulnerability perceptions on management practices. Seasonal precipitation varied across six Upper Midwest subregions and was significantly associated with variations in management. Increased warm-season precipitation (2007-2011) relative to the past 40 yr was positively associated with no-till, drainage, and increased planting on highly erodible land (HEL). Experience with saturated soils was significantly associated with increased use of drainage and less use of no-till, cover crops, and planting on HEL. Farmers in counties with a higher percentage of soils considered marginal for row crops were more likely to use no-till, cover crops, and plant on HEL. Respondents who sell corn through multiple markets were more likely to have planted cover crops and planted on HEL in 2011. This suggests that regional climate conditions may not well represent individual farmers' actual and perceived experiences with changing climate conditions. Accurate climate information downscaled to localized conditions has potential to influence specific adaptation strategies.",0.9128814147995515,0.2094394844582395,0.11336207289142632,0.3465990007169374,0.046209051676495944,0.024626888240647384,0.06550629888512705
Drought Risk and Adaptation in the Interior United States: Understanding the Importance of Local Context for Resource Management in Times of Drought,"Drought is a natural part of the historical climate variability in the northern Rocky Mountains and high plains region of the United States. However, recent drought impacts and climate change projections have increased the need for a systematized way to document and understand drought in a manner that is meaningful to public land and resource managers. The purpose of this exploratory study was to characterize the ways in which some federal and tribal natural resource managers experienced and dealt with drought on lands managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and tribes in two case site examples (northwest Colorado and southwest South Dakota) that have experienced high drought exposure in the last two decades. The authors employed a social-ecological system framework, whereby key informant interviews and local and regional drought indicator data were used characterize the social and ecological factors that contribute to drought vulnerability and the ways in which drought onset, persistence, severity, and recovery impact management. Results indicated that local differences in the timing, decisions, and specific management targets defined within the local social-ecological natural resource contexts are critical to understanding drought impacts, vulnerabilities, and responses. These findings suggest that manager-defined social-ecological contexts are critically important to understand how drought is experienced across the landscape and the indices that are needed to inform adaptation and response strategies.",0.7292065203813303,0.41097623510670706,0.19779075901032636,0.3500788896246597,0.1106657119778812,0.09900440385052942,0.38920904846775145

Smallholder farmers' perceptions of and adaptations to climate change in the Nigerian savanna,"The savanna region of Africa is a potential breadbasket of the continent but is severely affected by climate change. Understanding farmers' perceptions of climate change and the types of adjustments they have made in their farming practices in response to these changes will offer some insights into necessary interventions to ensure a successful adaptation in the region. This paper explores how smallholder farmers in the Nigerian savanna perceive and adapt to climate change. It is based on a field survey carried out among 200 smallholder farm households selected from two agro-ecological zones. The results show that most of the farmers have noticed changes in climate and have consequently adjusted their farming practices to adapt. There are no large differences in the adaptation practices across the region, but farmers in Sudan savanna agro-ecological zone are more likely to adapt to changes in temperature than those in northern Guinea savanna. The main adaptation methods include varying planting dates, use of drought tolerant and early maturing varieties and tree planting. Some of the farmers are facing limitations in adapting because of lack of information on climate change and the suitable adaptation measures and lack of credit. The study then concludes that to ensure successful adaptation to climate change in the region, concerted efforts are needed to design and promote planned adaptation measures that fit into the local context and also to educate farmers on climate change and appropriate adaptation measures.",0.9772149749473046,0.15676370597104358,0.07131484913336443,0.5827684999485288,0.028269083563683264,0.017795538503150854,0.03133534640799583
Climate change and adoption of sustainable land management practices in the Niger basin of Benin,"Due to the important role that the agricultural sector plays in sustaining growth and reducing poverty in developing countries, the adoption of practices that have the potential to simultaneously improve agricultural productivity while minimizing environmental impacts is essential. This paper examines the determinants of farmers' perceptions of climate change and subsequent adoption of sustainable land management practices in the Niger basin of Benin. Binary and multivariate probit models are applied in a two-stage regression procedure to cross-sectional data collected through a survey of 545 randomly selected farm households in 28 villages. The findings indicate that there are substitutabilities among three pairs of sustainable land management practices being used by the farmers. Climate change perception is positively related to land tenure, experience in farming, number of relatives, tractor use, and membership in farmers' organizations, and negatively related to household size, remoteness, and plough use. Moreover, the findings reveal that the uptake of land management practices is related to assets, land tenure, education level of the household head, remoteness, social network, non-irrigated land size, having a farm located near a river/lake/stream, tractor and plough use, being a subsistence farmer or not, and memberships in farmers' organizations. The adoption of sustainable land management practices could be encouraged through improving access to markets, adequate roads, and technologies, as well as by promoting membership in farmers' organizations.",0.9676312520861983,0.1736269691966915,0.154140799792754,0.6373794525429166,0.01758613942277359,0.01726038075881949,0.036346307877867
Perception of climate change and farm level adaptation choices in central Kenya,"Farmers are experiencing the need to adapt to climate change, and are developing different strategies. This article contributes to the understanding of farmers' adaptation choices, their determinants and their implications, in relation to the household income. In 2014, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and 220 household surveys were carried out with farmers in coffee and food crop zones in Central Kenya. The Heckmanmodel was used to evaluate the determinants of adaptation choices and their marginal effect. Farmers fromthe coffee zone or fromthe food crop zone perceive and adapt differently to climate change. Farmers who are aware of changes in climate are more willing to explore adaptation strategies. A positive relationship is found between adaptation to climate change and household income. The highest payoff/return is achieved if multiple adaptation choices are used rather than a single strategy. The choices of strategies are also determined by household characteristics, resource endowment, institutional variables, and climate information. The strong correlation between socio-institutional variables and adaptation capacity suggests the need for the establishment and strengthening of local institutions, such as micro-finance and extension.",0.9577750248549636,0.20776943565282874,0.0948843998954184,0.5667672827661123,0.03921986498291668,0.022216044949566367,0.03092677708197277
Perceptions of climate change variability and adaptation strategies on smallholder dairy farming systems: Insights from Siaya Sub-County of Western Kenya,"Climate change and variability is bound to impact Smallholder Dairy Farming Systems as a result of overreliance on rainfed fodder production; yet climate models project increased frequencies of droughts that have a bearing on the Length of Growing Period. Similarly higher environmental temperatures are partly attributed to biome-range shifts, implying a likelihood of emerging and re-emergence of livestock and fodder diseases and pests. Nonetheless not much is documented of perceptions and adaptation strategies employed by Smallholder Dairy Farming Systems geared towards resilience to climatie shocks. By employing a mixed method approach that included household surveys, focused group discussions and statistical data analysis using SPSS package, this study aimed to bridge some of the existing gaps in adaptation strategies on Smallholder Dairy Farming Systems in Siaya Sub-County of Western Kenya. Survey results obtained from 100 households and Focused Group Discussions revealed that the climate of the study location was perceived to have changed, with droughts singled out as the most frequent. These perceptions were consistent with long-term climate data analysis which affirmed that all seasons, i.e. MAM, JJA, and DJF with the exception of SON showed longterm drying trends. Similarly, environmental temperature showed upward trends in both maximum and minimum temperatures that were perceived to be the cause of proliferation of noxious weeds previously associated with hotter areas of the Sub-County. Typologies of adaptation strategies used in the study showed that adaptation options were limited since these were viewed through a narrow lens of disease control by regular spraying and maize stovers as supplementary livestock feed during fodder dearth periods. This study recommends that besides awareness creation of adverse impacts of climate change and variability, facilitation for ease of access to technologies that ameliorate its adverse effects ought to be put in place. Additionally, empirical studies on consequences of biome range shifts on pasture and fodder productivity, and future possible impacts of diseases on Bos taurus breeds associated with climate change and variability should be undertaken.",0.9355996287582787,0.20954948422219363,0.08429883772851474,0.5425088499968176,0.04176691876868655,0.01775805313756244,0.034846956073146966
The roles of community assets in mitigating the impact of drought on grain yields in Northwest China,"As an arid and semiarid region in that is frequently hit by drought, Northwest China is ecologically vulnerable. Faced with drought and other extreme events, policy makers have given top priority to the formulation and implementation of adaptation policies. This paper investigates the roles of community assets, including community social capital and access to public services, in mitigating the impact of drought in Northwest China. Based on a micro-level dataset of individual households and villages from two provinces, we find a major effect of community assets on grain yields, after controlling for other influences. Our econometric analyses show that the severity of drought in the study areas significantly reduces grain yields. The negative impact of drought, however, can be significantly mitigated in villages with better community assets. Several policies, including enhancing investments in communities' infrastructure and providing public services related to drought, are recommended to both improve local adaptive capacity to drought and reduce poverty in the drought-prone areas.",0.7215142463171432,0.3450620876712686,0.07772576970858458,0.4614305311502819,0.04658407480270105,0.07067195358294633,0.18048969335923978
"Climate change vulnerability, adaptation and risk perceptions at farm level in Punjab, Pakistan","Pakistan is among the countries highly exposed and vulnerable to climate change. The country has experienced many severe floods, droughts and storms over the last decades. However, little research has focused on the investigation of vulnerability and adaptation to climate-related risks in Pakistan. Against this backdrop, this article investigates the farm level risk perceptions and different aspects of vulnerability to climate change including sensitivity and adaptive capacity at farm level in Pakistan. We interviewed a total of 450 farming households through structured questionnaires in three districts of Punjab province of Pakistan. This study identified a number of climate-related risks perceived by farm households such as extreme temperature events, insect attacks, animal diseases and crop pests. Limited water availability, high levels of poverty and a weak role of local government in providing proper infrastructure were the factors that make farmers more sensitive to climate-related risks. Uncertainty or reduction in crop and livestock yields; changed cropping calendars and water shortage were the major adverse impacts of climate-related risks reported by farmers in the study districts. Better crop production was reported as the only positive effect. Further, this study identified a number of farm level adaptation methods employed by farm households that include changes in crop variety, crop types, planting dates and input mix, depending upon the nature of the climate-related risks. Lack of resources, limited information, lack of finances and institutional support were some constraints that limit the adaptive capacity of farm households. This study also reveals a positive role of cooperation and negative role of conflict in the adaptation process. The study suggests to address the constraints to adaptation and to improve farm level cooperation through extended outreach and distribution of institutional services, particularly climate-specific farm advisory services.

"Adaptation trajectories and challenges in the Western Ghats: A case study of Attappady, south India","Climate change adaptation has become an important aspect of research and policy agendas at different scales - globally, nationally and locally. One stream of thought relates to the thematic area of barriers or challenges that adaptation faces. This article explores local adaptation trajectories and challenges in a tribal development block in south India. Through the lens of key livelihood strategies pursued in the block - namely income from development interventions, migration and on-farm strategies - it explores the challenges and factors that contribute or have contributed, to impeding successful adaptation outcomes in Attappady. The article argues that development interventions (i.e planned adaptations) have not succeeded in addressing structural causes of vulnerability; they have, however, provided an important coping mechanism. Migration is a socially and culturally differentiated phenomenon and is not a viable diversification option for the most vulnerable population segments in Attappady. Finally, it is found that recent on-farm adaptation strategies present a case of maladaptation that promote marginalisation and are ill-suited to the local ecological and cultural landscape.",0.42341340229009927,0.33846307750265997,0.13424221593453015,0.5067980523848905,0.13202465814701048,0.063058622047976,0.09572084379202944
Effectiveness of the Local Adaptation Plan of Action to support climate change adaptation in Nepal,"A key challenge in climate change adaptation in developing countries as a whole, and to handling global change in particular, is to link local adaptation needs on the one hand, with national adaptation initiatives on the other, so that vulnerable households and communities can directly benefit. This study assesses the impact of the Nepal government's efforts to promote its Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA) and its applicability to other least developed countries (LDCs). Based on data gathered from two field studies in Nepal, the research shows that the Nepal's LAPA has succeeded in mobilizing local institutions and community groups in adaptation planning and recognizing their role in adaptation. However, the LAPA approach and implementation have been constrained by sociostructural and governance barriers that have failed to successfully integrate local adaptation needs in local planning and increase the adaptive capacity of vulnerable households. This paper describes the mechanisms of suitable governance strategies for climate change adaptation specific to Nepal and other LDCs. It also argues the need to adopt an adaptive comanagement approach, where the government and all stakeholders identify common local- and national-level mainstreaming strategy for knowledge management, resource mobilization, and institutional development, ultimately using adaptation as a tool to handle global change.",0.34381241439310695,0.42138670539570794,0.2112005213013118,0.36743805574857713,0.1346205498307984,0.14742340548939223,0.2821602106529371
Who Manages Space? Eco-DRR and the Local Community,"The notion of ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (DRR) has only recently emerged in Indonesia. The Indonesian central government now adopts some policies related to ecosystem-based DRR with formal commitments from local administrations. At the implementation level, various activities have taken place, such as mangrove planting and restoration along the coastline to address the rising sea level and the one billion trees program to address the urgent issue of deforestation. These governmental activities have involved local communities that reside in the high-risk area, while nonlocal actors, particularly from the private and the nongovernmental sectors, have contributed as a third element to development. This paper examines space management in the context of Eco-DRR, paying special attention to uncertainty and anxiety in the local communities as the government and private sectors engage in development activities that have significant impacts on their present and future lives. The present study pursues this purpose by means of in-depth interview and focus group discussions (FGD) with local leaders in mangrove planting and restoration programs. The study took place in a small island community in a part of the Jakarta Megapolitan Region, Indonesia. The results point out that the community feels left behind due to lack of trust in managing the conservation space. Another issue to be addressed is how to improve the democratization of environment management and livelihood base of the local community. Therefore, building confidence and ameliorating relationships between actors within/without the local community should lead to a better Eco-DRR initiative.",0.27354895353506997,0.4257369474318301,0.1506947274721994,0.39473735116956515,0.13259836281986032,0.17882724160877297,0.2941409201935741
"Urban climate adaptation and the reshaping of state-society relations: The politics of community knowledge and mobilisation in Indore, India","Current research on climate change adaptation in cities highlights the role of local governments in facilitating adaptation actions, but rarely assesses whether (and if so, how) local communities organise around emerging climate priorities to affect political change. This paper explores changing state-society relationships through the reconstitution of community collectives and advocacy organisations for advancing climate change adaptation in the Indian city of Indore. The paper shows that communities are indeed recognising the need for adaptation but are, at the same time, integrating adaptation actions with existing strategies for advocating development rights. Communities are also rebuilding alliances between municipal and local institutions for public service and infrastructure provision, which point to the centrality of community politics in urban climate adaptation processes. However, such mobilisations are often dependent on existing political networks and a legacy of advocacy around poverty alleviation needs, which sideline more transformative agendas around inclusiveness, equity, and resilient urban futures.",0.12775573288456957,0.5,0.09262896923796429,0.2561080926551389,0.10955196863580642,0.5,0.24975727134972897
"Climate change and its impacts: perception and adaptation in rural areas of Manizales, Colombia","Tropical social-ecological systems are highly vulnerable to climate change, given the limited natural climate variability in the tropics. Tropical rural populations, with livelihoods dependent on agriculture, are particularly vulnerable to climate variability and changes. To develop climate change social communication, plan and implement adaptation, it is necessary to understand regional/local climate process, risks and opportunities. It is also important to understand how local populations perceive such changes and adapt their livelihoods. Limited information is available on climate change perceptions in tropical Latin American rural populations. Hence, a climate study and climate change perception survey were carried out in the Manizales Municipality, in the Andean region of Colombia and one of its major coffee-growing areas. The study spanned three thermal levels in the tropical Andes, 1000m a.s.l. and above, each with distinct environments and livelihoods. Climate analysis yielded significant warming trends in recent decades, particularly in temperature minima for all levels, but no significant local precipitation trends. The perception survey, carried out in a sparsely populated region, mostly with limited accessibility, included 37 households, with structured and semi-structured interviews, adapted to local culture. Interviewees had little or no previous knowledge on climate change. However, almost all had perceived significant changes in both temperature and precipitation, which impacted their livelihoods and environment. Some perceptions could result from a La Nina event prior to the survey, and other environmental destruction processes. Their responses to change were spontaneous adaptation, based on traditional practices and agricultural technical advice from state agencies and coffee grower associations.",0.8293867586499132,0.3007619639788208,0.10169827735640956,0.4860516716458216,0.08081373143684513,0.03238862092733251,0.10843023074728239
Climate change adaptation strategies for smallholder farmers in the Brazilian Sertao,"Climate models agree that semi-arid regions around the world are likely to experience increased rainfall variability and longer droughts in the coming decades. In regions dependent on agriculture, such changes threaten to aggravate existing food insecurity and economic underdevelopment, and to push migration to urban areas. In the Brazilian semi-arid region, the Sertao, farmers' vulnerability to climate-past, present, and future-stems from several factors, including low yielding production practices and reliance on scarce and seasonally variable water resources. Using interpolated local climate data, we show that, since 1962, in the Bacia do Jacuipe-one of the poorest regions in the Sertao of Bahia state-average temperatures have increased similar to 2 degrees C and rainfall has decreased similar to 350 mm. Over the same time period, average milk productivity-the main rural economic activity in the county-has fallen while in Brazil and in Bahia as a whole milk productivity has increased dramatically. This paper teases apart the drivers of climate vulnerability of the Bacia do Jacuipe in relation to the rest of Bahia. We then present the results of a suite of pilot projects by Adapta Sertao, a coalition of organizations working to improve the adaptive capacity of farmers living in the semi-arid region. By testing a number of different technologies and arrangements at the farm level, Adapta Sertao has shown that interventions focused on balanced animal diets and efficient irrigation systems can help reduce (but not eliminate) the dependence of production systems from climate. They are thus viable adaptation strategies that should be tested at a larger scale, with implications for semi-arid regions worldwide.",0.902502883908366,0.2333031360540728,0.10531242547237034,0.5,0.026257798983839387,0.023081307346432385,0.12822620752317815
Stakeholders' climate perception and adaptation in coastal Uruguay,"Purpose - The purpose of this article is to discuss the assessment and inclusion of stakeholders' perception, and citizen participation instances to implementing management options to deal with climate threats within the existing institutional framework in Uruguay. Design/methodology/approach - The approach being followed has different directional approaches and integrates them within a single assessment. First, a prescriptive climate change top-down path. Second, stakeholders' perception is assessed within a bottom-up risk-management model. Third, institutional agreements, arrangements, and consensus are reached. Considering the need for agreed and effective options, the approach is customized and turned flexible enough to accept inputs from scientists, managers, and stakeholders. Findings - The co-production of knowledge and the achievement of agreed and feasible options is achieved by means of a consultation process which results in adaptive co-management agreements and collective decisions. This process is seen as both an empowerment of local actors and a multi-stakeholder learning-by-doing experiment. This allows for both an increase in coping capacity to climate threats and facilitates long standing conflict resolution. Originality/value - Much literature discusses the importance of the role of social power in inclusive processes towards adaptation, and how difficult is ceding a genuine voice to stakeholders. The co-production of knowledge is a way to achieve the rapprochement of scientists with institutional and community actors. Thus, the participatory process gives stakeholders responsibility for identifying their specific needs and priorities and helps to establish community ownership.",0.3842264072065626,0.3876449044105654,0.16568844479149522,0.2687882180600455,0.08739321913426534,0.15684616677812088,0.1610029420301981
"The local governance of climate change: new tools to respond to old limitations in Esmeraldas, Ecuador","This article argues that climate change, seen as a socially constructed anticipation of natural disasters and a future-risk that plays out in present politics, is enabling the emergence of new modes of governance in cities of the global south. The article focuses on the process by which the city of Esmeraldas, Ecuador, developed a Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Strategy. Within the context of climate change adaptation, Esmeraldas mobilised new discourses, stakeholders, and planning mechanisms to address pre-existing urban planning and development limitations. This discursively enabled the municipality's ongoing governance project by leveraging resources, creating consensus, and informing practice. Climate change adaptation thus became an important mechanism for engaging with local priorities, particularly those of the most vulnerable populations, and for bridging the gap between the formal world of policymaking and the reality of life in the city, which is more often structured by informality.",0.08003491088347545,0.3785087328449519,0.14216107352031102,0.24536990515112458,0.10980548230083369,0.5,0.26184484106734623
"Toward a Political Ecology of Migration: Land, Labor Migration, and Climate Change in Northwestern Nicaragua","Smallholder labor migration and its relationship to climate change adaptation has received increasing attention, with migration often represented either as part of successful adaptive livelihood diversification or as symptomatic of a lack of in-place adaptive capacity. Using a case study, we focus on the relationship between labor migration, agrarian livelihood diversification, and climate change to further a more nuanced understanding of ""migration as adaptation"" than is implied by a simple dichotomy of success versus failure. Smallholder diversification, both on- and off-farm, has largely been framed as a risk spreading practice that lowers climate change vulnerability. But after decades of advocating livelihood diversification, with labor migration now increasingly a part of smallholder livelihood activities, it is urgent to pose a number of questions: Why do smallholders migrate? How does labor migration unfold for them and with what outcomes? Our primary goal here is to explore the nature of the relationship of labor migration to climate change and climate change adaptation. Through empirical fieldwork in northwestern Nicaragua, we explore the role of labor migration in smallholder household production and reproduction, as families confront increasingly difficult climatic conditions for agricultural production and a relative absence of the state within a neoliberal political economy. Our analysis draws on household surveys and qualitative interviews and focus groups we carried out in the municipality of Somotillo, in northwestern Nicaragua, over three years (2013-15). Our findings demonstrate that household labor migration neither facilitates adaptation to climate change nor reflects a failure to adapt, but rather reflects the weak position of smallholders in interlocking relations of power and the relative land scarcity experienced by many. We argue that labor migration barely maintains semi-subsistence agricultural production and reinforces existing social inequalities, raising questions regarding a conceptualization of ""migration as adaptation"" and the benefits of this type of livelihood diversification.

Vulnerability Among Fishers in Southern Brazil and its Relation to Marine Protected Areas in a Scenario of Declining Fisheries,"Vulnerability of small-scale fishers in the north coast of Parana State, Southern Brazil, has been increasing due to a decline in catches and general problems of access to and management of natural resources, associated with biodiversity conservation policies. The predicted effects of climate change will represent an additional source of disturbance on local livelihoods. This study aimed to describe vulnerability of fishers and their adaptation strategies to ongoing reductions in catches, considered an analogue of possible responses to expected effects of climate change, and to evaluate the influence of no-take protected areas on them. Interviews were applied to 213 households, in 9 villages from Guaraquecaba, in the Paranagua Estuarine Complex. Results show that vulnerability varies in different spatial levels, mainly due to differences in the reliance on fisheries as a source of income, and in distribution of physical and social capital. Protected areas, if not adequately managed, can have a double negative effect on more vulnerable households, by restricting their access to mangrove resources in the present, and by limiting the viability of their favoured adaptation strategy for the future. These results are potentially useful for the development of biodiversity conservation and fisheries management actions adequate to the local level, and that contribute to reduce inequality and build resilience of fishers and the coastal ecosystems they rely on, in a scenario of declining fisheries and climate change.",0.6250984033077737,0.29858125731307406,0.1615621595855208,0.44853170797659525,0.17736684027755095,0.07565416268582692,0.05375742892827226
"Christmas Tourists' Perceptions to Climate Change in Rovaniemi, Finland","Rovaniemi in Finnish Lapland is the self-proclaimed official home of Santa Claus.' However, in recent years, after several warm and snowless season starts, Christmas tourism businesses have expressed concern about the future of the region's winter tourism industry. This paper examines the challenges of winter tourism operators to adapt to changing environmental conditions by surveying the responses of tourists to potential changes in winter conditions. In the light of climate change projections, maintaining the attractive image of a snow-covered winter wonderland may become impossible. Results indicate that tourists react negatively to estimated changes and planned adaptation mechanisms. This situation may force tourism entrepreneurs and destination managers to reconsider the consequences of current adaptation strategies and develop new attractions and marketing strategies in order to attract new markets and/or rebrand the destination.",0.31912208717089924,0.3551096394116444,0.14976653494510161,0.3920948314147285,0.06588587512762036,0.02993900944972069,0.027019797949011586
Planning for Climatic Extremes and Variability: A Review of Swedish Municipalities' Adaptation Responses,"Climate change poses a serious challenge to sustainable urban development worldwide. In Sweden, climate change work at the city level emerged in 1996 and has long had a focus on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. City planners' ""adaptation turn"" is recent and still ongoing. This paper presents a meta-evaluation of Swedish municipal adaptation approaches, and how they relate to institutional structures at different levels. The results show that although increasing efforts are being put into the identification of barriers to adaptation planning, in contrast, there is little assessment or systematization of the actual adaptation measures and mainstreaming strategies taken. On this basis, opportunities for advancing a more comprehensive approach to sustainable adaptation planning at both the local and institutional level are discussed.",0.12574995363998145,0.3112964738327559,0.09823510600131116,0.18567915813156394,0.0904354987779759,0.4358642454520994,0.19889354321131583
"Climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture, forestry and water management at the regional scale A case study from the North German Plain","Adaptation and mitigation measures are important in dealing with climate change impacts on agriculture, forestry and water management. Stakeholders have an important role to play in coping with climate change at the regional scale, so it is important to identify which measures they are aware of and which they have implemented. This paper describes the regional adaptation and mitigation measures taken by stakeholders in northern Germany and the connections between the sectoral measures and the spatial scales involved. The study finds that adaptation measures have either been implemented or chosen at the regional scale; that adaptation plays an important role at the regional scale whilst mitigation measures are almost non-existent; that water-related issues link the land use sectors examined; and that experts clearly view the national level as the appropriate level for policy makers to exert political influence on measures relating to climate change.",0.4154691545403533,0.3030251517551351,0.15856350140021555,0.1650502438958383,0.07577178304513678,0.21475172856837324,0.29717050121883254
"Adapting conservation to climate change: a case study on feasibility and implementation in Brandenburg, Germany","Conservation actions need to account for global climate change and adapt to it. The body of the literature on adaptation options is growing rapidly, but their feasibility and current state of implementation are rarely assessed. We discussed the practicability of adaptation options with conservation managers analysing three fields of action: reducing the vulnerability of conservation management, reducing the vulnerability of conservation targets (i.e. biodiversity) and climate change mitigation. For all options, feasibility, current state of implementation and existing obstacles to implementation were analysed, using the Federal State of Brandenburg, Germany, as a case study. Practitioners considered a large number of options useful, most of which have already been implemented at least in part. Those options considered broadly implemented resemble mainly conventional measures of conservation without direct relation to climate change. Managers are facing several obstacles for adapting to climate change, including political reluctance to change, financial and staff shortages in conservation administrations and conflictive EU funding schemes in agriculture. A certain reluctance to act, due to the high degree of uncertainty with regard to climate change scenarios and impacts, is widespread. A lack of knowledge of appropriate methods such as adaptive management often inhibits the implementation of adaptation options in the field of planning and management. Based on the findings for Brandenburg, we generally conclude that it is necessary to focus in particular on options that help to reduce vulnerability of conservation management itself, i.e. those that enhance management effectiveness. For instance, adaptive and proactive risk management can be applied as a no-regrets option, independently from specific climate change scenarios or impacts, strengthening action under uncertainty.",0.43241820334461806,0.2826076480898671,0.17978996053997817,0.22972613418123264,0.08625266755653731,0.11313105252368369,0.10002495813527978
Social capital and citizen perceptions of coastal management for tackling climate change impacts in Greece,"There is a growing consensus among researchers that social aspects and the involvement of local communities play a critical role in public decision-making processes in the coastal zone. Social capital is a parameter which has recently gained significant attention in this context. It is regarded that it has a significant influence on the adaptation capacity of local communities to climate change impacts. The present paper aims to contribute to this field through an examination of citizens' perceptions of three coastal zone management policies (hold the line, managed realignment and no active intervention) along with the influence of social capital on the level of social acceptability for these proposed policy options. For this purpose, a quantitative empirical study was conducted for the first time in five coastal areas of Greece that are regarded as high flood-risk areas due to sea-level rise. Respondents demonstrated that they are willing to accept changes in their social and natural environments in order to confront sea-level rise and are more positive towards the managed realignment option, as long as this is accompanied by financial compensation for those whose properties will be affected. Regarding the influence of social capital, through the results of an ordinal regression, it was observed that institutional and social trust influence positively citizens' level of agreement for the managed realignment policy. Furthermore, respondents who believe that a sense of reciprocity exists in their community are also more willing to accept active intervention policies.",0.18887984370351618,0.43525836978797233,0.09759315387330696,0.22752974279982302,0.2955374397859139,0.4026237374908811,0.16158821212430277
The awareness of two stakeholders and the resilience of their built assets to extreme weather events in England,"Purpose: The purpose this paper is to examine how aware and prepared the elderly and a number of related housing associations (HAs) are of extreme weather events and the impact on their built assets as a result of climate change. It investigates how extreme weather and associated risks are perceived and the measures taken to protect the assets. Design/methodology/approach: Desk research and two questionnaire surveys were conducted to collect data and information in relation to the awareness of extreme weather events and how built assets are adapted as a response. Survey results were tabulated and analysed using qualitative coding techniques and examined to identify relationships and patterns across different criteria in relation to awareness and built form adaptation to extreme weather events. Findings: The surveys illustrate that awareness is high but the actions carried out as adaptations do not significantly reduce risks. Lack of personalisation of the risk and the resulting avoidance behaviour seems to prevent any considerable actions being taken. Thus, the elderly seem to accept basic energy saving measures as extreme weather adaptations rather than seek substantial actions that minimise risk to their houses. The results highlight the need to identify different design, construction and management solutions to improve resilience of different dwelling types to different economic sectors and different community groups. Research limitations/implications: The HA survey sample is too small to derive general conclusions but illustrates the varying positions of different organisations. Future research will further the survey with a larger sample and extend to local authorities (LAs). Practical implications: The findings provide valuable information and insights to all related stakeholders in formulating programmes in securing built assets in extreme weather events. Social implications: Provide an understanding of the awareness and the preparedness of a vulnerable group, the elderly, and their dwellings to extreme weather events. Originality/value: While the government hold consultations and dissemination events at national and regional levels, individual community groups and local agencies who are directly involved in providing services are not yet engaged in this dialogue. These two surveys made an attempt to gauge the awareness and the preparedness of the respondents of two such segments, in adapting their homes and built assets as a response to extreme weather associated risks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0.28320541460089926,0.4181232637724498,0.09383288511470927,0.2645547332527205,0.07162605294732279,0.12795727820544786,0.16892126140007171
Improving adaptive capacity of small-scale rice farmers: Comparative analysis of Lao PDR and the Philippines,"Lao PDR and the Philippines are among the Asian countries whose exposure to climate risks seriously threatens livelihood, particularly of those in the agriculture sector. The paper provides a comparative analysis of the adaptive capacity and current adaptation strategies of small-scale rice farm households in these countries. The analysis focused on two top rice-producing provinces in each country that are vulnerable to climate risks. It covered three rice production environments or ecozones - irrigated lowland, rainfed lowland and rainfed upland in two cropping seasons, wet and dry. Sources of data include survey of rice farmers; key informant interviews with local government officials; focus group discussions with farmer and village leaders and extension workers; and local government reports. Calculation of adaptive capacity index adopted the procedure applied by the United Nations Development Program (cited in Swanson et al. 2007) on the Human Development Index. It incorporates various bio-physical and socio-economic factors affecting adaptive capacity. The analysis shows specific interventions that could improve household adaptive capacity to a changing climate, particularly extreme events and draw comparative lessons for possible uptake of other countries. The losses and damages experienced by the households show that livelihood, particularly of the poor farmers, is largely natural resource-based which is highly vulnerable to climate risks. The impacts of extreme events such as drought and typhoon vary by location, ecozone and cropping season. Farmers, particularly in the rainfed areas, have limited access to adaptation technologies and alternative livelihood sources. In the Philippines, farmers expressed the need for improved farming technologies, funding, skills and knowledge on adaptation to changing climate and advance warning on climate events. In Lao PDR, farmers need support for flood resistant rice varieties and better infrastructure because of their farms' vulnerability to flooding and landslide. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.",0.9244473639827688,0.26461621958245757,0.16222996282859456,0.5911958518468529,0.10339308763481772,0.03491826509536094,0.10716427900780263
Impact of climate-smart agriculture adoption on the food security of coastal farmers in Bangladesh,"Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is a suggested pathway to the improvement of food security in a changing climate. The Department of Agricultural Extension under the Bangladesh Ministry of Agriculture has been promoting CSA with farmers through climate field schools since 2010. This study investigated the impact of adoption of CSA practices on the household food security of coastal farmers in southern Bangladesh. Factors determining household food security were also explored. Data were collected from 118 randomly selected farmers of Kalapara sub-district in Patuakhali, Bangladesh. We identified 17 CSA practices that were adopted by the farmers in the study area. Those practices were saline-tolerant crop varieties, flood-tolerant crop varieties, drought-resistant crop varieties, early maturing rice, vegetables in a floating bed, 'sorjan' method of farming, pond-side vegetable cultivation, the cultivation of watermelon, sunflower or plum, relay cropping, urea deep placement, organic fertilizer, mulching, use of pheromone trap, rain water harvesting and seed storage in plastic bags or glass bottles. The farmers adopted on average seven out of these CSA practices. Among the sampled households, 32% were assessed as food secure, 51% were mildly to moderately food insecure and 17% were severely food insecure. Adoption of CSA practices was positively associated with household food security in terms of per capita annual food expenditure (beta = 1.48 Euro, p = 0.015). Households with a better educational level, farming as a major occupation, a larger pond size, greater number of cattle, higher household income, smaller family size and less difficulty with access to markets were likely to be more food secure. Increasing the adoption of CSA was important to enhance food security but not a sufficient condition since other characteristics of the farmers (personal education, pond size, cattle ownership and market difficulty) had large effects on food security. Nevertheless, increased adoption of saline-tolerant and flood-tolerant crop varieties, pond-side vegetable cultivation and rainwater harvesting for irrigation could further improve the food security of coastal farmers in southern Bangladesh.",0.9958842097721579,0.10976609321165882,0.03531889481909404,0.7649041002405046,0.019499535371085147,0.012176443290441463,0.032754305716897525
Farmers' perception of and adaptation to climate-change impacts in the Dry Zone of Myanmar,"In Myanmar, impacts of climate change have been apparent since 1977. Myanmar's economy, which exclusively depends on agriculture, is increasingly at risk due to climate change. Since farmers are often the first to confront climate change, they must adapt to new climatic conditions. Local adaptation practices, the possible starting points in developing new adaptation strategies, are currently occurring at a local scale, particularly based on the traditional knowledge. We used household survey, participatory histogram mapping and key-informant interviews to explore the farmers' perception and adaptation practices to climate change in the Myanmar Dry Zone. Ninety per cent of respondents perceived the changing climatic patterns in the Dry Zone, while increasing temperature and the erratic rainfall patterns were perceived as the predominant changes by 85% of the people. The farmers also perceived that there have already been several impacts of climate changes on agriculture. The common sesame/groundnut cropping pattern has been abandoned by the Dry Zone farmers in recent decades due to climate-change-driven agricultural production barriers. Farmers have been dealing with those barriers using their conventional agricultural practices, e.g. rainwater-collection, tube wells and water-harvesting techniques. They have also been using the traditional weather forecasting techniques to predict weather. Consequently, the study underlines the need to document existing agricultural practices that can prove to be successful adaptation measures, and it points out the crucial role of the extension strategy in disseminating agricultural techniques and weather information to support farmers to further adapt to climate-change impacts.",0.9711186394937336,0.20103766832335035,0.09154038665187315,0.5,0.015757513778098566,0.020525394045507187,0.06145135020412159
DOES ADOPTION OF MULTIPLE CLIMATE-SMART PRACTICES IMPROVE FARMERS' CLIMATE RESILIENCE? EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM THE NILE BASIN OF ETHIOPIA,"There is a paucity of information on conditioning factors that hinder or promote adoption of multiple climate-smart practices and on the synergies among such practices in increasing household resilience by improving agricultural income. This study analyzes how heat, rainfall, and rainfall variability affect farmers' choices of a portfolio of potential climate smart practices - agricultural water management, improved crop seeds, and fertilizer - and the impact of these practices on farm income in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia. We apply a multinomial endogenous switching regression approach by modeling combinations of practices and net farm income for each combination as depending on household and farm characteristics and on a set of climatic variables based on geo-referenced historical precipitation and temperature data. A primary result of this study is that farmers are less likely to adopt fertilizer (either alone or in combination with improved varieties) in areas of greater rainfall variability. However, even when there is high variability in rainfall, farmers are more likely to adopt these two yield-increasing inputs when they choose to (and are able to) include the third part of the portfolio: agricultural water management. Net farm income responds positively to agricultural water management, improved crop variety or fertilizer when they are adopted in isolation as well as in combination. But this effect is greater when these practices are combined. Simulation results suggest that a warming temperature and decreased precipitation in future decades will make it less likely that farmers will adopt practices in isolation but more likely that they will adopt a combination of practices. Hence, a package approach rather than a piecemeal approach is needed to maximize the synergies implicit in various climate smart practices.",0.970826069201484,0.17723184956334082,0.0792649180777171,0.6365351533713453,0.012915688746907785,0.021694548863227536,0.07129977521455004
Evaluating a decision analytic approach to climate change adaptation of cultural resources along the Atlantic Coast of the United States,"Climate change poses some of the most significant risks for the preservation of coastal cultural resources or cultural heritage. As a result, more research is needed to facilitate the design and implementation of feasible and transparent adaptation strategies for cultural resources under changing climate conditions. In this paper, we begin to explore the challenges and opportunities that face cultural resource managers as they begin to grapple with climate change adaptation planning in dynamic coastal environments. Specifically, we provide an overview of a value-focused, decision-analytic approach that was applied in a pilot test of climate adaptation planning for buildings within designated historic districts on the barrier islands of Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina. We provide descriptions of the challenges that are uniquely facing cultural resource managers and initial evidence of the utility of this type of approach for informing judgments by presenting pre- and post-workshop survey data. Although additional research is critical to offer planning and policy guidance, we found that structured deliberations about cultural resource adaptation planning not only influenced participants' opinions but also provided a necessary space to better understand the complexities of climate and budget uncertainties. Our evaluation is a first step at documenting the difficult and value-laden decisions that must be addressed by cultural resource managers as fiscal constraints and impending climate impacts threaten the traditional approach of preservation in perpetuity.",0.12775918999810487,0.3567055756720329,0.18884583773063945,0.27524192175814816,0.1387286755786854,0.3104421578084601,0.15278909949962713

The state of climate change adaptation in the Arctic,"The Arctic climate is rapidly changing, with wide ranging impacts on natural and social systems. A variety of adaptation policies, programs and practices have been adopted to this end, yet our understanding of if, how, and where adaptation is occurring is limited. In response, this paper develops a systematic approach to characterize the current state of adaptation in the Arctic. Using reported adaptations in the English language peer reviewed literature as our data source, we document 157 discrete adaptation initiatives between 2003 and 2013. Results indicate large variations in adaptation by region and sector, dominated by reporting from North America, particularly with regards to subsistence harvesting by Inuit communities. Few adaptations were documented in the European and Russian Arctic, or have a focus on the business and economy, or infrastructure sectors. Adaptations are being motivated primarily by the combination of climatic and non-climatic factors, have a strong emphasis on reducing current vulnerability involving incremental changes to existing risk management processes, and are primarily initiated and led at the individual/community level. There is limited evidence of trans-boundary adaptations or initiatives considering potential cross-scale/sector impacts.",0.39161276041043624,0.417289017229927,0.2358216152106572,0.3641959971204808,0.1914829860130674,0.07214820770165893,0.11581366974507863
"Power, perception, and adaptation: Exploring gender and social-environmental risk perception in northern Guanajuato, Mexico","This paper examines how gender relations within rural communities in north-central Mexico affect women's perceptions of and responses to environmental and social risks. Several studies currently exist which suggest various reasons as to how people especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change perceive their risks, and how this influences their responses. In this paper, I take a feminist approach to questions of social-environmental risks and adaptation to argue that risk perception is tightly linked to knowledge production, and knowledge production is a power-laden process involving the constant negotiation of resources, responsibilities and knowledge. I base this argument on the results of fieldwork conducted, from September 2009 to May 2010 with women residents of two ejidos in northern Guanajuato, Mexico. In drawing from feminist political ecology studies, I intend to show how gender, environmental knowledge, risk perception and thus, adaptation are constituted by and embedded in social relations of power.

Identifying most feasible adaptation options to heatwaves and heavy rain events in New York City,"Cities are places of high vulnerability to climate change due to their density of people, assets, and infrastructure and their high diversity of people of and from different socio-economic backgrounds, gender, ethnicity, and age, determining knowledge and knowledge access, support networks, and other assets important for adaptation. The City of New York-on which this study is based-is highly diverse in socio-economic but also in natural characteristics (proximity to sea, natural areas, building and population density), e.g. across its 5 boroughs who serve as identity markers. Does these differences lead to varying and significant (perception of) climate change impacts? If this turns out to be true, city planning may need to pursue different climate change adaptation strategies in different boroughs, which is the underlying hypothesis. I employ Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping to investigate the current perception and affectedness of New Yorkers from all boroughs towards weather extreme events, i.e. heavy rainstorms and heat waves. I compare their impact perception and run adaptation scenarios to evaluate the most feasible adaptation strategy to alleviate burden. © 2016 IEEE.",0.2743976062425081,0.4254707929333003,0.07414651460403802,0.2987044733202099,0.059372320179322605,0.20300614819245646,0.08175534913005894
United States agricultural stakeholder views and decisions on climate change,"Climate change poses unprecedented challenges to agricultural production globally and in the United States; it is both vulnerable to the impacts of a changing climate and a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Because farmers need to quickly adapt to reduce their risks and emissions, there is a pressing need to better understand the process by which they make decisions. This complex decision-making process includes many factors, such as farmers' beliefs; knowledge and capacity to make changes; the information they receive from Extension, industry, and social networks (e.g., family and peers); economics and regulations; and farm-scale and environmental issues (including personal experience with extreme weather). This study assesses the published literature on U.S. agricultural stakeholder views and decisions on climate change, focusing on farmers and ranchers from different regions. We identify key themes that emerge from the literature on how stakeholder views about extreme weather and climate change relate to decisions about adaptation and mitigation practices. This review finds that although the majority of U.S. farmers believe the climate is changing, many remain skeptical of the issue and uncertain about the anthropogenic causes of climate change. Farmers' climate change mitigation and adaptation decisions also vary widely and are often correlated with belief or other factors such as personal experience with extreme weather, costs of change, or fear of regulation. We conclude with the implications of the research, including the importance of understanding farmers' view and actions and issue framing, and implications for researchers, Extension and policy makers, both nationally and globally.

"The government-led climate change adaptation landscape in Nunavut, Canada","The Canadian Arctic is uniquely sensitive to climate change impacts, including rapidly warming temperatures, sea ice change, and permafrost degradation. Adaptation-including efforts to manage climate change risks, reduce damages, and take advantage of new opportunities-has been identified as a priority for policy action across government levels. However, our understanding of adaptation in the Canadian North is limited: Is adaptation taking place, to what stresses, and what does it look like? In this paper we answer these questions for the Inuit territory of Nunavut, systematically cataloguing and reviewing government-led adaptation programs and policies at community, territorial, and federal levels, drawing on publically available information. We documented a total of 700 discrete adaptation initiatives. The focus on adaptation to-date has primarily been at the groundwork level, aimed at informing and preparing for adaptation through impact assessments, adaptation planning exercises, and stakeholder engagement. Adaptation in Nunavut has been driven by cross-scale coordination and leadership from the territorial and federal government. Our study finds few examples of concrete actions for planned adaptation, such as changes to or creation of policies that enable adaptation, alterations to building codes and infrastructure design with changing geohazards, or enhanced disaster planning and emergency preparedness in light of projected impacts. This study indicates a need for formal adaptation plans for the Governments of Canada and Nunavut, emphasis on adaptation monitoring and evaluation, and a greater role of Inuit traditional knowledge and cultural values in adaptation policy.",0.2429502944436109,0.4492956198346197,0.19176920890709798,0.2176708952966535,0.18022888712834154,0.2765748552424514,0.21982398996223648

"A decision tree analysis to support potential climate change adaptations of striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus Sauvage) farming in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam","This study uses the decision tree framework to analyse possible climate change impact adaptation options for pangasius (Pangasianodon hypopthalmus Sauvage) farming in the Mekong Delta. Here we present the risks for impacts and the farmers' autonomous and planned public adaptation by using primary and secondary data. The latter studies showed that a proportion of the pangasius farms located in the coastal provinces will be affected by salinity intrusion in the dry season. Options to adapt to this are: modify pangasius farming practice, stock other species or stock saline-tolerant pangasius. With research and extension support, farmers can further improve their already adapted practice to deal with salinity or use water recirculation systems for prolonged nursery rearing. A breeding program for saline-tolerant striped catfish requires a medium-to long-term investment (0.4 % of the production cost) from government and/or private company. Pangasius farms in up- and mid-stream regions and in coastal areas, which are not located within upgraded government dyke-protected areas, will be affected by flooding at the end of each rainy season. This implies an increased cost for dykes to about 0.34% and 0.25% of the total variable costs for one harvest per ha in the up- and mid-stream regions, and in the downstream region, respectively.",0.7169293038752834,0.2474692593805742,0.107325116797119,0.3046365044266599,0.12158625442082117,0.10815872065985241,0.06524151343046569
Port Decision Maker Perceptions on the Effectiveness of Climate Adaptation Actions,"Effective adaptation to climate change impacts is rapidly becoming an important research topic. Hitherto, the perceptions and attitudes of stakeholders on climate adaptation actions are under researched, partly due to the emphasis on physical and engineering aspects during the adaptation planning process. Building on such considerations, the paper explores the perceptions of port decision makers on the effectiveness of climate adaptation actions. The findings suggest that while port decision makers are aware of potential climate change impacts and feel that more adaptation actions should be undertaken, they are skeptical about their effectiveness and value. This is complemented by a regional analysis on the results, suggesting that more tailor-made adaptation measures suited to local circumstances should be developed. The study illustrates the complexity of climate adaptation planning and of involving port decision makers under the current planning paradigm.",0.22155883910864763,0.3587899505799231,0.12391362515259603,0.18661634033749946,0.1374746132255515,0.30321295427217004,0.14345490102730543
"Resilience of Infrastructure Systems to Sea-Level Rise in Coastal Areas: Impacts, Adaptation Measures, and Implementation Challenges","Expansive areas of low elevation in many densely populated coastal areas are at elevated risk of storm surges and flooding due to torrential precipitation, as a result of sea level rise. These phenomena could have catastrophic impacts on coastal communities and result in the destruction of critical infrastructure, disruption of economic activities and salt water contamination of the water supply. The objective of the study presented in this paper was to identify various impacts of sea level rise on civil infrastructures in coastal areas and examine the adaptation measures suggested in the existing literature. To this end, a systemic review of the existing literature was conducted in order to identify a repository of studies addressing sea level rise impacts and adaptation measures in the context of infrastructure systems. The study focused on three infrastructure sectors: water and wastewater, energy, and road transportation. The collected information was then analyzed in order to identify different categories of sea level rise impacts and corresponding adaptation measures. The findings of the study are threefold: (1) the major categories of sea level rise impacts on different infrastructure systems; (2) measures for protection, accommodation, and retreat in response to sea level rise impacts; and (3) challenges related to implementing adaptation measures.",0.14726462046626945,0.3687341431632704,0.14014409554995938,0.2196893862530782,0.466281434919663,0.6908337608975147,0.4514329640728276
Gendered adaptation of Eritrean dryland farmers,"Purpose - This paper aims to report findings of a study of vulnerability that identified adaptation strategies of male and female farmers in two regions of Eritrea. The country is suffering from food shortage because of climate and non-climate stressors. As such, erratic rainfall, chronic droughts and extreme weather adversely affect crop production. This paper answers the question of how policy instruments and cultural practices, and their interaction, increase or reduce the vulnerabilities of male and female agricultural producers, including producer perceptions of how instruments and culture can be improved. Design/methodology/approach - Interviews and focus groups were conducted in the two study regions in Eritrea. Documents and transcripts of the interviews and focus groups were coded by theme and analyzed. Findings - Findings revealed that the main rainy season has reduced from four to two months, and the minor rainy season has often failed. As a result, exposure and sensitivity to climate change affects all farmers. These climate change impacts together with Eritrean government policy instruments, including the limited availability, affordability and accessibility of agricultural inputs such as land, fertilizer, seeds, and male labor exacerbate the vulnerability of agricultural producers. Tigrinya farm women are the least able to adapt to extreme weather because of an unequal distribution of resources resulting from cultural, patriarchal views of women which have prevented them from being regarded as equal primary farmers and further limit their access to the resources mentioned. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the prescribed military service of men in their community (which is not prescribed in the matrilineal Kunama community). Producers perceive that addressing this gender inequality and improving government instruments, most importantly getting rid of mandatory military service, will improve adaptation. Practical implications - Concrete recommendations made by the community are reported. Originality/value - This paper presents important findings from qualitative research conducted in Eritrea.",0.897678055205088,0.2694075991443197,0.07265029928382528,0.5879540787589187,0.04948499354444251,0.04006077656142858,0.09686759798314518
Meta-analyses of factors motivating climate change adaptation behaviour,"Adaptation behaviour is of critical importance to reduce or avoid negative impacts of climate change. Many studies have examined which factors motivate individuals to adapt. However, a comprehensive overview of the key motivating factors of various adaptation behaviours is lacking. Here, we conduct a series of meta-analyses using data from 106 studies (90 papers) conducted in 23 different countries to examine how 13 motivational factors relate to various adaptation behaviours. Descriptive norms, negative affect, perceived self-efficacy and outcome efficacy of adaptive actions were most strongly associated with adaptive behaviour. In contrast, knowledge and experience, which are often assumed to be key barriers to adaptation, were relatively weakly related to adaptation. Research has disproportionally focused on studying experience and risk perception, flooding and hurricanes, and preparedness behaviours, while other motivational factors, hazards and adaptive behaviours have been understudied. These results point to important avenues for future research.",0.48300495188733406,0.3332712882739027,0.11287727848859706,0.2724315009240253,0.0993013950565717,0.12925677524998097,0.19181795428601967
"Climate adaptation: Institutional response to environmental constraints, and the need for increased flexibility, participation, and integration of approaches","Adaptation to the impacts of climate change is a dynamic process that is shaped by institutional, cultural, and socioeconomic contexts. Efforts to adapt to changing climate may occur on many scales and may be undertaken by a variety of stakeholders and do not occur in institutional vacuum. As globalization has increased the exchange of knowledge across space, a greater number of institutions have become involved in adaptation measures encompassing multiple scales. In order to gain insight into how adaptation might unfold into the future, we investigate the interactions between institutions operating at multiple levels in the innovation of new technologies on demand. From a broad sample of cases, we identify four distinct types of adaptation measures and select one corresponding case representing each type to assess the roles of institutions (and other stakeholders) in innovation. We further identify and discuss two findings that cut across all adaptation measures: (1) the need for widespread participation, flexibility, and integration of stakeholders for quick and effective response, and (2) the need to transfer leadership and responsibility from institutionally led adaptation measures to community based measures so that adaptation is sustained into the future. Together, these findings suggest that the types of adaptation measures implemented primarily from the top down may not promote local resilience in the long term; likewise, those measures implemented from the bottom up require some level of collaboration from the top to maximize their effectiveness.

Focus of the study and data,"As a follow-up to Chapter 2, which discussed three general approaches to climate change adaptation research, this chapter outlines in more detail the specific focus of this study within the literature by reviewing some previous research on three subtopics: the impact of extreme weather shocks on households, the coping and adaptation mechanisms that households rely on when affected by shocks, and the relationship between climate change, weather shocks, and migration. In terms of scientific contribution, the more innovative results are probably those related to the relationship (or lack thereof) between weather shocks and the destruction they cause, and migration. Therefore, more space is devoted in this review chapter to the literature on that topic. Finally, the chapter also introduces the process that was followed for collecting the household surveys used for the empirical work. © 2015 International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank.

A typology of adaptation actions: A global look at climate adaptation actions financed through the Global Environment Facility,"Climate change impacts threaten existing development efforts and achieving future sustainability goals. To build resilience and societal preparedness towards climate change, integration of adaptation into development is being increasingly emphasized. To date, much of the adaptation literature has been theoretical, reflecting the absence of empirical data from activities on the ground. However, the Funds established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and managed by the Global Environment Facility, the Least Developed Countries Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund and the Strategic Priority for Adaptation, have approved financing for 133 adaptation projects in 70 countries with sufficient documented experience to allow for initial categorization and evaluation. This article provides the first substantial compendium of adaptation actions identified through the allocation and disbursement of these Funds and organizes these actions into a generalized typology of adaptation activities. The information obtained sheds new insight into what adaptation is, in practice, and suggests some next steps to strengthen the empirical database. Ten types of overarching adaptation activities were identified through an analysis of 92 projects financed through these Funds. This paper analyzes these adaptation activities and compares them with theoretical constructs of adaptation typologies. We find that many of the early ideas and concepts advanced by theoreticians are consistent with results from the field. The adaptation categories that recur the most in Global Environment Facility projects are enabling and relatively inexpensive measures, such as those related to capacity building, policy reform, and planning and management. However, a rich panoply of technical actions ranging from information and communications technology, to early warning systems, to new or improved infrastructure, are also identified as common project goals. Future refinements of the costs of various adaptation actions, the mixture of technical and management options, and evaluating the efficacy of actions implemented, will be key to informing the future global adaptation agenda.

Climate change adaptation: factors influencing Chinese smallholder farmers' perceived self-efficacy and adaptation intent,"Understanding how individuals perceive their ability to adapt to climate change is critical to understanding adaptation decision-making. Drawing on a survey of 483 smallholder farmer households in the Loess Plateau region of China, we examine the factors that shape smallholder farmer perceptions of their ability to adapt to climate change and their stated intent to do so. We apply a proportional odds ordered logistic regression model to identify the role that determinants of adaptive capacity play in shaping smallholders' perceived self-efficacy and adaptation intent. Our study provides further evidence that self-efficacy beliefs are a strong, positive predictor of adaptation intent. Our study suggests that human capital, information and technology, material resources and infrastructure, wealth and financial capital, and institutions and entitlements all play an important role in shaping smallholder perceived self-efficacy, while state-society dependencies may reduce smallholder perceived self-efficacy. In addition, our study suggests that perceiving climate change risks and impacts do not necessarily lead to an intention to adapt. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of incorporating both the objective determinants of smallholders' adaptive capacity and their subjective perceptions of these objective determinants into future climate change adaptation programs and policies in order to facilitate adaptive actions. Identifying factors that cause individuals to have a low estimation of their adaptive ability may allow planned adaptation interventions to address these perceived limitations and encourage adaptive behavior.",0.6862242594162768,0.3048013661462728,0.12450578250485922,0.4250217427869231,0.09046635763412494,0.03271576865489963,0.08324576442949731
The role of social capital for farmers' climate change adaptation in Lancang River basin in China,"This paper distinguishes between bridging and bonding social capital to assess their roles for individual farmers' adaptation strategies taken through technology adoption. Based on primary data collected in Langcang River (LCR) basin area in southwestern China, the paper finds: (1) adaptation measures have been widely taken by surveyed households, but non-infrastructure-based measures are more prevalent than infrastructure-based measures and (2) surveyed households have strong social capital while having weak bridging social capital. Their bonding social capital has significantly positive relationship with their adaptation decisions, but bridging social capital does not have such statistically significant relationship. It recommends that the governments contemplate carefully how to help the poor to get a good combination of bonding and bridging social capital when designing policies to help the rural poor to improve their long-term adaptive capacity and achieve sustainable rural development.",0.6855208707191285,0.40264698074106753,0.07342860471514479,0.5246862453922078,0.15054732860525336,0.12218677969203177,0.12211973710640035
An activity theoretic analysis of the mediating role of information systems in tackling climate change adaptation,"This paper demonstrates that information systems (IS) researchers and practitioners can make a significant contribution to the grand challenge of sustainability in light of global climate change. In doing so, the paper takes a novel perspective by going beyond the dominant emphasis in the Green IS literature on climate change mitigation to focus on climate change adaptation. To demonstrate how IS researchers and practitioners can engage with the grand challenge of sustainability, we report the findings of an investigation into the role of IS in climate change adaptation programmes of the government of New South Wales, Australia. Canonical action research, informed by activity theory, proved to be an appropriate methodology for this investigation by combining iterative collaborative engagement and rigorous scholarly reflection. Activity theory has previously been successfully used in IS research as a framework for inquiry and description but not for prediction. This raised questions, addressed in this study, about whether or not activity theory could be used to guide interventions and make sense of their impact. The findings reveal how activity theory provides an appropriate balance between scope and detail to accommodate the complex processes of planning and implementing climate change adaptation programmes. We conclude that while climate adaptation is complex, activity theory, specifically five dynamic dimensions for deep sense-making, can inform interventions in climate change adaptation projects. Most significantly, we demonstrate that IS experts can make a positive contribution to addressing one of the most important grand challenges of our time.",0.2671849562230903,0.382934402728861,0.15616516665545524,0.2635462207674183,0.0662835903522985,0.15635676779164925,0.06406242971354834
Planning adaptation based on local actors' knowledge and participation: a climate governance experiment,"Involving a wide-range of stakeholders at different moments in the planning of urban adaptation to climate change can help to overcome different barriers to adaptation, such as a lack of common perception, or control over options. This Article argues for an approach that involves a wide range of actors throughout the planning process in order to confront the challenges of urban adaptation to climate change. It builds on the results of a three-year participatory action research project to identify the catalysts with which local administrations can overcome the lack of data, the low level of engagement around the climate issue, and the cause-and-effect linkages of climate change impacts on the urban environment. Significant factors include territorial rootedness, leveraging actors' experience, interaction between actors, as well as the valuing of local actors as experts of territorial management rather than as novices with regard to climate change adaptation. In addition to contributing towards the engagement of a large number of stakeholders around adaptation issues, a planning process that involves representatives from various sectors and during several stages contributes to a greater understanding of these issues and their linkages. It follows that such a process will bring changes to urban practices by better articulating local concerns about climatic issues. Policy relevance Although participation is commonly advocated in policy responses to climate change, only few empirical studies have investigated the ways in which local actors' knowledge can be integrated into climate change adaptation planning processes. The article builds on the results of an action research project carried out in Quebec City, Canada, to address the relevance of involving a progressively broader range of actors as the adaptation process moves through its various phases. Given that a multitude of barriers to adaptation are at play at different times in a municipality, collaborations between local stakeholders emerge as a key factor. These collaborations provide greater insight into the linkages between climate change impacts and the urban environment and, in doing so, bring into question ordinary urban management and design practices.",0.12928734550894366,0.3539118748445313,0.08796406481102748,0.19753080582318297,0.08132177589571934,0.5567247730984644,0.16281486301371
The Human dimensions of environmental changes: Environmental perception and adaptation strategies in Ilha Comprida - São Paulo,"In this article, the authors discuss the relations between the demographic dynamics, the environmental perception and the environmental changes at Ilha Comprida, a municipality from the southern coastline of São Paulo. The case study showed that there is an accelerated erosion process affecting the northeast of the island, which is a menace to the constructions and the resident population of this area. The objective of this study was to know and analyze how local environmental perception is and which actions are being performed by the population (resident and seasonal) and by the local government to face the erosion in the northern end of Ilha Comprida (Ponta Norte). Firstly, the methodology applied included a systematic bibliographic research about the study area and the geological and physical studies to understand the coastal dynamics of the studied region; secondly an analysis of the Brazilian census data for understanding the socio-demographic characteristics of the population in environmental risk situation and, finally, qualitative interviews were conducted with different social groups, such as residents, visitors, government personnel and experts. The results indicated that environmental perception involves some differentiation between residents and non-residents, including some components of demographic dynamics, such as gender, age and residence time that were identified in the categories of the research analysis. The way the population perceives and faces environmental hazards is related to their attachment to the place, which reflects their actions to cope with the environmental hazards of the municipality. Residents and visitors remain in the area and make use of individual or familiar strategies to face the coastal erosion. Although people had their houses affected by the erosion in the past or they are on the verge of being affected, the community at Ponta Norte are unwilling to move from the area at risk. The results indicated that it is necessary to promote actions of adaptation to the coastal erosion because the government authorities don´t have management plans in force to deal with the current and future environmental hazards of this coastal-estuarine environment. © 2017 UNIVALI.

Measuring the level of corporate commitment regarding climate change strategies,"Purpose - This study aims to examine the various climate change practices adopted by firms and develop a set of corporate indexes that measure the level of climate change corporate commitment, climate change risk management integration and climate change strategies adoption. Moreover, this study examines the relationship between the aforementioned indexes. The authors claim that there is a positive relationship between the adoption of climate change strategies, corporate commitment and risk management integration. The aforementioned indexes have been used to assess the largest companies in the oil and gas sectors. Design/methodology/approach - To assess this study's sample companies, a content analysis of their carbon disclosure project (CDP) reports for the years 2012-2015 was conducted. Finally, weights were assigned to the content analysis data based on the results of a survey regarding the difficulty of implementing each climate change practice included in the respective index. The survey sample included climate change experts who are either currently employed in companies that are included in the Financial Times Global 500 (FT 500) list, or work as external partners with these companies. Findings - The present study results highlight the need for developing elaborate corporate indexes, as the various climate change practices have different degrees of difficulty regarding their implementation. Additionally, a general trend in adopting climate change strategies is observed, especially in the field of carbon reduction strategies, which mainly involve the implementation of low carbon technologies. Finally, a positive and significant relationship was found between carbon reduction targets, risk management integration and climate change strategies. Practical implications - Although international research has extensively examined the importance of managers' perceptions on environmental issues as an enabling factor in developing environmental strategies, according to the results of our survey, corporations must go beyond top management commitment towards climate change to be able to successfully implement climate change strategies. Incorporation of climate change risk management procedures into a company's core business activities as well as the establishment of precise carbon reduction targets can provide the basis on which successful climate change strategies are implemented. Originality/value - Most studies address the issue of climate change management in terms of environmental or sustainability management. Furthermore, research on climate change and its relationship with business management is mainly theoretical, and climate change corporate performance is measured with aggregate indexes. This study focuses on climate change which is examined from a five-dimensional perspective: top management commitment, carbon reduction targets, risk management integration, carbon reduction and carbon compensation strategies. This allows us to conduct an in-depth analysis of the various climate change practices of firms.",0.5,0.26035703128780857,0.1503757219794604,0.2266639377771825,0.0575844392449734,0.10689736744306436,0.09903631904587301
Climate change adaptation in the western-Himalayas: Household level perspectives on impacts and barriers,"A vast amount of knowledge and experience on coping with climatic variability and extreme weather events exists within local communities, and indigenous coping strategies are important elements of successful adaptation plans. Traditional knowledge can help to provide efficient, appropriate and time-tested ways of responding to climate change especially in far-flung communities. However, little is known about how traditional coping strategies translate into adaptation to long-term changes, and to what degree they prevent pro-active, transformational responses to climate change. This paper assesses the use of climate related information for communities in the Himalayan foothills of rural India, and reports on the barriers to adaptation planning and actions. Surveys have been carried out to analyze the current practices and the role of information in planning for climate change adaptation in the rural areas of the Nainital region of India located in Western Himalaya. Respondents perceive the local climate change, the intensity of change, and the negative impacts on the community and landscape. Decreases in water quantity and changes in precipitation patterns are among the major concerns for respondents, however, communities have begun to use traditional knowledge and historical climate information for developing strategies suitable to cope with impacts of climate change. Going forward, additional information is needed to match the high priority community needs with viable adaptation strategies. Lack of money, lack of access to information, and lack of awareness or understanding are considered the three largest hurdles besides low priority for adaptation, recognized by community members as barriers to adaptation planning and actions. Adaptation plans must be integrated into both top-down and bottom-up approaches to plan for enabling sustainable development and the efficient use of information for adaptation. Finally, tradititilkal knowledge seems to be useful not only in contrasting climate change impacts, but also in recovering several ecosystem services that work all together for enanching the quality of life of villagers at local scale.",0.5184035232558972,0.3431705819182607,0.1464629553545247,0.3875492991010318,0.07073873653686301,0.08051303227416286,0.1904978162209338
Farmers' Adaptation to Climate Variability: Assessment of Effectiveness and Barriers Based on Local Experience in Southern Philippines,"This study assessed the effectiveness of and barriers to adaptation of upland farming households in Bukidnon Province, Southern Philippines to climate variability. Using focus group discussions, key informant interviews and household surveys combined with the analysis of climate variability in the area, the study described key adaptation strategies commonly practiced at the household and community levels in relation to crop production and income generation, domestic and farm water supply, soil conservation, health and livelihood; and assessed the effectiveness and barriers in the implementation of these strategies. There were few variations in adaptation strategies across different crops grown by farmers. While few ineffective adaptation strategies were noted, current strategies were perceived to be generally effective although some barriers exist in their implementation. Among these barriers include high cost, limited adaptation options, and difficulty in implementation. Despite the perceived effectiveness, future uncertainty is a major concern since climate variability is likely to worsen, threatening health, food and livelihood security. Planned adaptation founded on robust current and future vulnerability assessments is necessary to address the future risks associated with the changing climate. Moreover, to realize effective farmers' adaptation to future climate change impacts, the anticipated critical adaptation barriers should be successfully overcome.",0.889301177354972,0.2607546253692371,0.08303502736150659,0.5608467918591525,0.026430104250224448,0.050714050384321537,0.08087934473886148
What Does Autonomous Adaptation to Climate Change Have to Teach Public Policy and Planning About Avoiding the Risks of Maladaptation in Bangladesh?,"Climate vulnerability represents a highly complex public policy challenge for government due to its interaction with diverse social, political, economic, and ecological factors across scale. The policy challenge is further exacerbated when rural livelihood opportunities depend on multiple land use practices within shared social-ecological systems and adaptation actions related to one practice affects the others. In such cases, it becomes likely that national and regional-level adaptation plans will result in maladaptive trajectories if local context and properties are not carefully considered. This review highlights the importance of this issue to public policy using the case of climate change adaptation planning in Bangladesh to highlight how national and regional-level planned adaptation processes could bene fit from paying closer attention to the autonomous adaptation processes occurring at local levels. Focussing on the northeastern floodplain region, an area dominated by wetland ecosystems, high climate vulnerability, and diverse and complex land use practices, we examine some of the community-level adaptation actions that are being undertaken in response to climate change and contrast these with national-level adaptation planning strategies and actions. We then analyze how the planned adaptation actions taken by government may actually end up being maladaptive, either by shifting or rebounding vulnerability. We conclude that government adaptation planning would bene fit from a greater focus on learning and scrutinizing the autonomous adaptation of communities to climate stress before making significant resource allocation decisions.",0.30890421880943514,0.4602696256932862,0.22184998666230749,0.36613095153099345,0.17596908632156436,0.14072382701566835,0.2075890880242196
Factors affecting rural landholders' adaptation to climate change: Insights from formal institutions and communities of practice,"This study explores the factors affecting rural landholders' adaptation to climate change from the perspectives of formal institutions and communities of practice. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with formal institutions (e.g. South Australian government agencies) and communities of practice (e.g. farm systems groups) within two natural resource management regions in South Australia. Both groups noted that rural landholders autonomously adapt to a variety of risks, including those induced by climate variability; however, the types and levels of adaptation varied among individuals as a result of variety of barriers to adaptation. The lack of communication and engagement processes established between formal institutions and communities of practice was one major barrier. The paper presents and discusses a model for transferring knowledge and information on climate change among formal institutions, communities of practice, trusted individual advisors and rural landholders, and for supporting the co-management of climate change across multiple groups in rural agricultural areas in Australia and elsewhere.

"Insurance Companies' Responses to Climate Change: Adaptation, Dynamic Capabilities and Competitive Advantage","Drawing on the dynamic capability view, we analyse how insurers adapt to climate change impacts and how adaptation relates to corporate financial performance. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we deduce seven categories of adaptation measures associated with three dynamic capability dimensions of climate change adaptation (i.e. climate knowledge absorption, climate-related operational flexibility and strategic climate integration). Using this framework, we conduct a content analysis of insurers' adaptation efforts as reported to the Carbon Disclosure Project. Regression analysis reveals positive relationships between climate knowledge absorption and return on assets (ROA), climate-related operational flexibility and ROA, and between the total number of adaptation measures and ROA.",0.40631646647401803,0.3612205975741805,0.2117855365428935,0.2790377424669297,0.12770382987309192,0.14617268327032007,0.20845750029622198
Gendered consequences of mobility for adaptation in small island developing states: case studies from Maafushi and Kudafari in the Maldives,"In recent years island communities have actively adapted in response to a complex combination of changes that has shaped life on the islands, and this has had gendered consequences. The gender ramifications of adaptation on islands are still largely neglected in adaptation policies, although they are increasingly being addressed in the scientific literature. Understanding gendered consequences is indispensable for a critical comprehension of adaptation on islands. It would help avoid the formulation of adaptation policies that tend to focus only on technical problems and solutions. Such solutions potentially run the risk of reducing island problems to only biophysical issues such as sea level rise or problems attributed to the size and isolation of the islands. This paper investigates the consequences of adaptation for the mobility of both women and men on two islands in the Maldives, a small island developing state (SIDS) that has experienced unprecedented changes in recent decades. The focus on mobility stems from the fact that it forms an integral social and cultural part of island life. Although gender and mobility are intrinsically linked, the gendered consequences of adaptation for mobility are understudied. This study used qualitative interviews to collect narratives. The results show that the adaptation interviewees describe from their living memory has only exacerbated gender inequality by influencing the mobility of men and women in different ways.",0.3468505656282531,0.521010327953082,0.10500611018747875,0.42561095920645686,0.45561441254358653,0.10944878587617324,0.33034022222021064
Communicating climate change for adaptation in rural communities: a Pacific study,"The academic literature on climate change communications is growing. However, the majority of this literature focuses on the issue of climate change mitigation in a developed country context, and there is little published material regarding communication in a developing country and adaptation context. Similarly, despite community-based approaches to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction increasing in the Pacific Islands region, there is very limited guidance on how to effectively communicate climate change in a way that enhances people's resilience. This paper documents the experiences of organisations, including local and international non-government and faith-based organisations, governments, regional technical organisations and donor agencies in communicating climate change for adaptation in the Pacific region. Three key climate change communication challenges are highlighted and suggestions made for overcoming them based on results from interviews, a focus group discussion and an online forum. Finally, recommendations are made for good practice guidance in climate change communication that is empowering and culturally relevant.",0.3533276807725097,0.4446736211176112,0.17050743859221396,0.3075166682906612,0.17493823320261825,0.11621859875321695,0.1879784277441238
Climate change adaptation trends in small island developing states,"Small island developing states (SIDS) are among the countries in the world that are most vulnerable to climate change and required to adapt to its impacts. Yet, there is little information in the academic literature about how SIDS are adapting to climate change, across multiple countries and geographic regions. This paper helps to fill this gap. Using a sample of 16 countries across the Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea, Caribbean and Pacific regions, this study has two main aims, to identify (1) national-level adaptation trends across climate, climate-induced and non-climate-induced vulnerabilities, sectors and actors, as reported in National Communications (NCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and (2) typologies of national-level adaptation actions in SIDS. It identifies, codes and assesses 977 adaptation actions. These actions were reported as addressing 47 climate and climate-induced vulnerabilities and 50 non-climate-induced vulnerabilities and were undertaken in 37 sectors by 34 actors. The paper proposes five typologies of adaptation actions for SIDS, based on actions reported by SIDS. It specifically explores the implications of its findings for global adaptation strategies. As this work establishes a baseline of adaptation action in SIDS, it can assist national governments to gauge their adaptation progress, identify gaps in their adaptation effort and, thereafter, develop appropriate strategies for filling the gaps. It can also assist donors, whether bilateral or multilateral, to make more 'climate-smart' investment decisions by being able to identify the adaptation needs that are not being met in SIDS.",0.24602485108342798,0.4024086542155602,0.18944199879307416,0.41065772567796804,0.3075575676061299,0.33222607803534887,0.22347114862048248
"Perceptions of adaptation, resilience and climate knowledge in the Pacific: The cases of Samoa, Fiji and Vanuatu","Purpose While the South Pacific is often cited as highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, there is comparatively little known about how different groups perceive climate change. Understanding the gaps and differences between risk and perceived risk is a prerequisite to designing effective and sustainable adaptation strategies. Design/methodology/approach This research examined three key groups in Samoa, Fiji and Vanuatu: secondary school teachers, media personnel, and rural subsistence livelihood-based communities that live near or in conservation areas. This study deployed a dual methodology of participatory focus groups, paired with a national mobile phone based survey to gauge perceptions of climate change. This was the first time mobile technology had been used to gather perceptual data regarding the environment in the South Pacific. Findings The research findings highlighted a number of important differences and similarities in ways that these groups perceive climate change issues, solutions, personal vulnerability and comprehension of science among other factors. Practical implications These differences and similarities are neglected in large-scale top-down climate change adaptation strategies and have key implications for the design of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and therefore sustainable development in the region. Originality/value The research was innovative in terms of its methods, as well as its distillation of the perceptions of climate change from teachers, media and rural communities.",0.4580785238957842,0.36985947987186085,0.11737654169056677,0.40723047235097776,0.08229036164382018,0.09663083552909014,0.14906015520339594
Impacts of Socio-Psychological Factors on Actual Adoption of Sustainable Land Management Practices in Dryland and Water Stressed Areas,"Despite the presence of several studies on technology adoption, there are limited empirical studies on how socio-psychological factors affect the adoption of sustainable agriculture. Therefore, this paper investigates how socio-psychological factors-such as social capital, information, attitudes, efficacy, and aversion-affect smallholder farmers' decisions to adopt sustainable land management practices, such as agroforestry systems, organic compost, and crop rotation with legumes. Cross-sectional data are collected from 350 randomly selected farm households using a pre-tested and structured questionnaire. A multivariate probit model is used to investigate factors that influence the probability of adopting these practices. The ordered probit model is also applied to identify and analyze the determinants of the number (intensity) of land management practices adopted. The findings indicate that nearly half of the farmers have adopted these land management practices to improve soil fertility, enhance water retention capacity, and increase productivity. It is also found that attitudes, information, education, group membership, relational capital, risk attitudes, and labor supply significantly affect the probability of adopting these agricultural practices. The estimates of the ordered probit model also indicate that extension services, risk attitudes, group membership, relational capital, education and labor supply are major determinants of the number of land management practices used. However, financial resources, biophysical factors and some demographic factors are found to have an insignificant effect on sustainable agriculture adoption. This implies that when it is necessary to promote sustainable land management practices and to stimulate smallholder farmers to adopt such practices in isolation or combination, specific strategies should be designed to improve awareness, build positive attitudes, reduce risk aversion, strengthen formal organizations, and empower endogenous groups (or informal institutions).",0.9605377034895827,0.21139875131180927,0.10639739789834525,0.533109885849058,0.017277768736540123,0.019672958134527366,0.03666064803422758
What shapes vulnerability and risk management in semi-arid India? Moving towards an agenda of sustainable adaptation,"In drylands across the global South, rural livelihoods are challenged by existing development deficits, and are now increasingly vulnerable to climate variability and change. People, governments, and a range of non-state actors are responding to these climatic and non-climatic risks through planned and autonomous response strategies. While several studies examine the drivers of vulnerability and range of response strategies undertaken, few distinguish development interventions from climate adaptation actions, making it difficult to identify particular entry points for enabling and strengthening adaptation action. In this paper, we apply Eakin et al.'s (2014) framework of generic versus specific capacity to data from three semi-arid regions in India to examine the implications of multi-scalar response strategies on local adaptive capacities and adaptation processes. We find that current arguments of good development translating into effective adaptation are not always seen: building specific capacities to deal with climatic risks is essential to leverage wins through development interventions. This can help semi-arid regions and people living in them to move towards sustainable adaptation pathways.",0.5282264994799885,0.3471817115654184,0.10413200089666921,0.5875679651688054,0.07652725372896764,0.08821793986250429,0.09237136508004094
Stakeholders' perspectives towards effective climate change adaptation on the Mongolian livestock sector,"Climate change is one of the greatest threats that world is facing today, and having significant deleterious effects on natural and human systems. Recent climate-induced extreme events and their impacts demand timely adaptation actions to the changing odds of their occurrence. The great phenomenon is already being felt in the Mongolian plateau, especially on the livestock sector. The sector provides the main income and livelihood for one-third of the population of about three million people. A high number of livestock is lost due to a unique phenomenon is known as a ""dzud"". This paper examines the key stakeholders' perspectives in the implementation of climate change adaptation and identifies its barriers, with a focus on the livestock sector. In order to meet the objectives, this research used a semi-structured interview with organizations related to the livestock sector and climate change. The extent of stakeholders' perspectives might be depending on the way they share information, stakeholder engagement, and their experiences with extreme events, as well as their location and level in government. The research findings will indicate an understanding of climate change perspectives, adaptation, and level of capacity of organizations, which can be used as a guideline for organizations to develop climate change adaptation policies related to the livestock sector in Mongolia.",0.39731355446000294,0.30560305308638597,0.1658674098158443,0.34930629406334207,0.07155578988714456,0.10258987289752028,0.08482567760393774
Climate change impacts on rainfed cropping production systems in the tropics and the case of smallholder farms in North-west Cambodia,"The consequences of climate change on smallholder farms are locally specific and difficult to quantify because of variations in farming systems, complexity of agricultural and non-agricultural livelihood activities and climate-related vulnerability. One way to better understand the issues is to learn from the experiences of farmers themselves. Thus, this study aimed to better understand rainfed upland cropping systems in NW Cambodia and to identify practical, social and economic constraints to adoption of known climate adaptation options applicable to local agro-ecosystems. The study also sought to document the climate change perceptions and adaptation options employed by farmers to mitigate the climate risks. A household survey was conducted in the districts of Sala Krau and Samlout in North-west Cambodia in 2013 where 390 representatives of households were randomly selected for interviews, group discussions and field observations. The majority of respondents perceived that changes had occurred in the rainfall pattern such as a later start to the monsoon season, decreasing annual rainfall, increasing frequencies of drought and dry spells, and warmer temperatures. Farmers reported reductions in crop yields of 16-27 % over the five-year period of 2008-2012. However, these reductions were not evident in provincial data for the same period. Farmers claimed climate impacts resulted in significant yield reductions, but they appear not to have an effective strategy to adapt to the changes in climate. Further regional research is required to refine climate change adaptation strategies for rainfed upland cropping systems in Cambodia.",0.9638671907405257,0.2237518960436744,0.09216761056704771,0.49457874883257147,0.028976508652350148,0.012696780508231914,0.03727010101731956
Climate change adaptation options in rainfed upland cropping systems in the wet tropics: A case study of smallholder farms in North-West Cambodia,"While climate change is confirmed to have serious impacts on agricultural production in many regions worldwide, researchers have proposed various measures that farmers can apply to cope with and adapt to those changes. However, it is often the case that not every adaptation measure would be practical and adoptable in a specific region. Farmers may have their own ways of managing and adapting to climate change that need to be taken into account when considering interventions. This study aimed to engage with farmers to: (1) better understand small-holder knowledge, attitudes and practices in relation to perceived or expected climate change; and (2) document cropping practices, climate change perceptions, constraints to crop production, and coping and adaptation options with existing climate variability and expected climate change. This study was conducted in 2015 in Sala Krau village near Pailin (12 degrees 52'N, 102 degrees 45'E) and Samlout (12 degrees 39'N, 102 degrees 36'E) of North-West Cambodia. The methods used were a combination of focus group discussions and one-on-one interviews where 132 farming households were randomly selected. We found that farmers were conscious of changes in climate over recent years, and had a good understanding of likely future changes. While farmers are aware of some practices that can be modified to minimize risk and cope with anticipated changes, they are reluctant to apply them. Furthermore; there are no government agricultural extension services provided at the village level and farmers have relied on each other and other actors in the value chain network for information to support their decision-making. There is a lack of knowledge of the principles of conservation agriculture that urgently require agricultural extension services in the region to build farmer ability to better cope and adapt to climate change.

Climate Change and Forest Communities: Prospects for Building Institutional Adaptive Capacity in the Congo Basin Forests,"Tropical forests are vulnerable to climate-change representing a risk for indigenous peoples and forest-dependent communities. Mechanisms to conserve the forest, such as REDD+, could assist in the mitigation of climate change, reduce vulnerability, and enable people to adapt. Ninety-eight interviews were conducted in three countries containing the Congo Basin forest, Cameroon, CAR, and DRC, to investigate perceptions of decision-makers within, and responses of the institutions of the state, private sector, and civil society to the challenges of climate change. Results indicate that while decision-makers' awareness of climate change is high, direct institutional action is at an early stage. Adaptive capacity is currently low, but it could be enhanced with further development of institutional linkages and increased coordination of multilevel responses across all institutions and with local people. It is important to build networks with forest-dependent stakeholders at the local level, who can contribute knowledge that will build overall institutional adaptive capacity.",0.39335924575868186,0.3718269046212005,0.17684554180744969,0.22038936720348307,0.10360144358812028,0.05113684583716218,0.06730231918201335

Optimizing dambo (seasonal wetland) cultivation for climate change adaptation and sustainable crop production in the smallholder farming areas of Zimbabwe,"Most smallholder farming areas of Zimbabwe have low soil fertility and low rainfall, which has continually decreased over the past years. In recent years, most of the smallholder farming areas have experienced perennial droughts, poor rainfall distribution and crop failures and these have been attributed to climate change and variability. Cultivation of dambos, which are seasonal wetlands, presents a climate change and variability adaptation option for smallholder farmers. This synthesis analyses the role of dambo cultivation in climate change and variability adaptation and discusses future directions for sustainable dambo utilization. The data on current dambo farming practices were collected from literature, surveys and field observations. The results showed that farmers grow crops in dambos as an adaptive strategy to climate change and variability and have largely abandoned upland fields where yields are <1 t ha(-1) in preference of dambos where yields average 2-3 t ha(-1). Dambo cultivation offers a buffer against crop failures and has resulted in improved household food security. We conclude that dambo cultivation is a potentially beneficial farmer-driven climate change and variability adaptation strategy. However, if not properly designed and managed, dambo cultivation may result in their degradation hence there is need for further research to evaluate options for sustainable dambo utilization as intensification of dambo agriculture is important for food security.",0.9647128229224609,0.18844017967842283,0.09428081685040013,0.5934360901132927,0.016745859254487568,0.014444257803918508,0.02359427411138401
Assessing vulnerability of rural communities to climate change A review of implications for forest-based livelihoods in South Africa,"Purpose - The paper aims to enhance the understanding of the impacts of climate change on rural communities in Africa, including people's livelihoods, their adaptive capacity, coping practice and ability to engage in sustainable forest use and management of climate change adaptation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for a desktop review approach, using the forest-based rural communities of South Africa as a case study. Findings - This review shows that climate variability and change are affecting rural people and their livelihoods negatively. Forest-based livelihoods are particularly vulnerable. Nevertheless, the people have developed coping mechanisms to cushion the effects of climate variability and change. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these strategies are greatly constrained by factors that are related mostly to their socioeconomic characteristics (for example, skill level, educational status and health) and the functionalities of infrastructures and services in their communities. Research limitations/implications - Given that the study focused on forest-based rural communities and livelihoods, the results may be limited in generalizability. This may have particular implications for other categories of rural communities and livelihoods in Africa and developing countries in other continents. Practical implications - The study showed that opportunities for planning and implementing effective climate change adaptation at rural community level in South Africa are reliant on effective strategies to overcome the constraints identified by the study. The authors thus recommend that climate change adaptation initiatives in rural communities of Africa should focus on improving people's socioeconomic conditions and the overall sustainable development of the community. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need to study how climate change affects rural forest-based communities and livelihoods.",0.6445461131744633,0.4383438475318255,0.128871736428955,0.5588233378873959,0.10764970200863104,0.07350115489324446,0.10887003677078275

"Evaluating water productivity of tomato, pepper and Swiss chard under clay pot and furrow irrigation technologies in semi-arid areas of northern Ethiopia","Managing irrigation water is among the critical issues to address food insecurity under climate change and variability conditions. Irrigation is suggested as one of the adaptation practices commonly implemented to reduce climate related risks. However, there is scarcity of water in many drylands and identifying an efficient and effective irrigation system is crucial. A comparative study was undertaken between bar-shaped clay pot and furrow irrigation on tomato, pepper and Swiss chard crops in northern Ethiopia during the cropping season of 2014/2015. Results were compared on the basis of yield, water productivity and economic performance. The yields of Swiss chard, tomato and pepper were increased by up to 51, 32 and 30%, respectively, in bar-shaped clay pot irrigation system as compared to the control. Water saving was also considerably increased by 40.6, 41.2 and 41.7% for the respective crops as compared to the control. Similarly, the water productivities of Swiss chard, tomato and pepper were 10.9, 4.2, and 1.8 kg m-3, respectively. Further research on the suitability of bar-shaped clay pot irrigation on various soils and crops is recommended.

ADAPTATION THROUGH WATERSHED MANAGEMENT IN THE CHANGING CLIMATE,"Civilization has been experiencing frequent changes in the climate due to global warming. The developing nations are worst affected as they are largely dependent on the local precipitation and soil moisture for their livelihood generations. The changing climate with extended summer, change in the rainfall pattern (intensity and duration) and variations of onset and departure of seasons are directly impacting the cultivation, status of natural vegetation, surface and sub-surface water, and other natural resources in a watershed area. Among the various efforts, watershed development approach, in which intervention is more site-specific in nature and can address the local requirements, is found to be more effective at micro levels. The vulnerability of climatic changes is mainly due to water stress, degradation of natural vegetations, degradation in the health and hygiene conditions, and poor information communication technology. The present article highlights these issues, impact of watershed development project in the Himalayan region and identifying the adaptation mechanism through watershed programs. A site specific action, research methods including primary and secondary data collections, GIS, remote sensing and statistical techniques were used. The study on the Jusho Bakro micro-watershed treated by TERI under the program DROP has been found to be effective in drawing possible adapting mechanism to withstand the changing climate and its severity on the natural resources and the livelihood of the community.",0.562210856888118,0.31944868112823893,0.20480320784439407,0.4212345802630311,0.05793491533795527,0.080092449372254,0.29633116417640415
Climate risks and adaptation strategies in the Lower Mekong River basin,"This paper examines perceived climate risks, their impacts, and existing adaptation practices at the local level, including the role of local institutions. The analysis focuses on two selected areas in Vietnam and Thailand. The paper is based on the information collected through key informant interviews at provincial and district level, focus group discussions at village level, and household survey. Several adaptation practices exist at local level to deal with the perceived risks of drought, floods, and salinity intrusion. Most of the adaptation practices were autonomous focusing on coping with short-term risks rather than structural long-term climate risks. Some adaptation practices, such as crop insurance and regulatory measures included in the literature and practiced in other places, did not exist at local level in the case study countries, but some local practices such as farmers' annual fair could be an important addition to the inventory of potential adaptation measures. Local institutions have facilitated adaptation in different ways. They (1) lead and support unique adaptation practices suitable to the local context; (2) act as a catalyst to help people to adapt some practices by providing technical and material support; and (3) act as the bridge between local people and the governmental and non-governmental agencies. But several factors constrain the effectiveness of locally practiced adaptation measures. Thus, to enhance the adaptive capacity of households and the local community, it is necessary to: (1) improve the technical capacity of farmers; (2) create effective mechanisms for strengthening, promoting, and disseminating locally initiated efforts; (3) subsidize and improve access to credit services; (4) improve links between production and markets; and (5) establish effective mechanisms for coordination.",0.8014528677697285,0.3300224384847285,0.06847011233916761,0.3863305829519718,0.05609058829603166,0.09110917059621829,0.13813451648544828
Analyzing flood risk and related impacts to urban communities in central Vietnam,"This study aims at understanding flood risks and their impact on a community, in order to enhance communities' resilience and adaptive capacity to these threats. It also investigates the possibility of looking at and handling risk from a resilience point of view. Therefore, while a conventional risk management process is employed in this study, social, physical, economic, and institutional dimensions of resilience are also included in order to grasp the extent of risks and the ways in which communities face, cope with, and recover from flooding. Findings showed that there was no significant difference in the perception of flood risk among household heads educated up to secondary school level, suggesting that they believe floods are purely natural events. Those with a higher level of education (high school and above) (82.7 % of respondents) were aware that flood disasters are the result of hazard and vulnerability combined. In addition, social dynamics were apparently strengthened by such disasters, which resulted in cohesion and mutual help following floods in some wards. Also, households with more sources of income and more savings appear to recover faster than others after a flooding event. With regard to governance and networks, greater efforts have to be made by local institutions to ensure basic functioning during and after disaster events and to invest more into risk reduction activities. However, further studies need to be conducted to clarify the understanding of the impact flood disasters have on the environment and community lives and livelihoods in general, as traditional coping strategies, although still practical, no longer suffice in the face of changes in climate and environment.",0.19870478190962687,0.37749370867027215,0.09206826210332159,0.3584431512840743,0.13602950157665056,0.335180149662139,0.6456549095916182
Joint optimization of water allocation and water quality management in Haihe River basin,"A hydroeconomic optimization modelling framework for joint water allocation and water quality management is presented in this study. Water resources planning is often limited to water quantity, even though water quantity and quality are interdependent. Including water quality in a hydroeconomic optimization model increases complexity and uncertainty. In this study, the problem is addressed with a multi-reservoir, multi-temporal, multi-objective linear optimization model with fixed but spatially variable water quality. Model complexity is kept at a manageable level, leading to limited demand for computational resources, despite a high spatial resolution and representation of both surface water and groundwater resources. The model is applied to Haihe River basin, a water-scarce and highly polluted river basin in China. Economic trade-offs between limiting groundwater overdraft and sub-basin specific costs as well as maps of water availability shadow prices are presented. Adding water quality to the model framework impacts water availability shadow prices, which can influence model-based decision support. If groundwater abstractions are limited to sustainable levels, Haihe River basin will benefit from increasing inter-basins transfers and groundwater recharge to the shallow plain area aquifer. A scenario analysis showed that managed aquifer recharge in the plain area is also a feasible adaptation strategy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

CONSTRAINS AND CONSENSUS ON WATER USE AND LAND ALLOCATION IN MINOR SCHEME TANKS IN THE DRY ZONE OF SRI LANKA,"In the dry zone of Sri Lanka, climate change is predicted to exert a severe impact on paddy cultivation. Paddy is cultivated with irrigation water from reservoirs called ""tanks"", and decisions regarding water distribution from tanks are made by farmers in cultivation meetings which are held before cultivation seasons. In this study we focused on the bethma practice and other field crops cultivation which are potentially adaptation measures to climate change, but are not actively applied. This study tries to find constraints on applying bethma practice and other field crops (OFC) cultivation for better adaptation to climate change. We investigated the current status of bethma practice and of OFC cultivation, the reasons for the decline of bethma, and the manner in which farmers arrive at a consensus on water and land use. For the investigation we used survey data and observation of a cultivation meeting in a study area. We found that bethma is rarely applied at present and the reason is largely based on human perception of dislike of bethma, due to the unfairness in sharing responsibility in land use. This results in not only the decline of bethma but also disagreement on cultivating OFC with tank water. The lack of mechanism to arrive at a consensus between owners of suitable land and land users is a key constraint to practicing OFC using tank water. When farmers try to adapt climate change through water and land management or OFC cultivation, a new mechanism is necessary to ensure fairness in sharing responsibility for land use.",0.8882496998709999,0.2512709703451255,0.15593977606636494,0.29588963577618743,0.03440181556909938,0.06051279462959389,0.18165639981928255
e-Infrastructure for Climate Adaptation Policies: the UNDP/AAP Activities,"To effectively plan for adaptation to climate change and its impacts, decision makers require the infrastructure and tools that will provide them with timely access to current and future climate information. For example, climate scientists and operational forecasters need to access global and regional model projections and current climate information that they can use to generate climate products and services for multi-sectorial adaptation planning. Through the UNDP African Adaption Programme (AAP), an e-infrastructure capacity has been built across Africa that will provide multi-tiered access to such information and data for informed decision making. Web accessible servers provide both computational power and access to the information at many levels: including raw and processed climate model output, real-time climate conditions and products, knowledge products (technical documents and presentation) as well as decision support tools for decision and policy makers. In this paper we present (report and discuss) the results of a two-year activity in building such an e-infrastructure under the AAP program and the extensive technical support and services programme associated with establishing capacity across Africa.",0.3518798364978638,0.28455409615643573,0.10610584591046694,0.27134042375260947,0.07849137389174092,0.20312528467500576,0.10794358640850184
Reducing vulnerability to hydro-meteorological extremes in Africa. A qualitative assessment of national climate disaster management policies: Accounting for heterogeneity,"In Africa, hydro-meteorological disasters (HMDs) have hit with increasing frequency and magnitude in recent years, with detrimental impacts on local livelihoods.African countries display a patchwork of national policies and institutional frameworks to address these rising HMDs.This paper examines the heterogeneity that exists within Africa's institutional arrangements for climate-related disaster risk management, and introduces a three-partite policy classification that ranks each country as one of three disaster management policy types: the 'Unprepared Firefighters' (whose response to disasters is late, delayed and ineffective), the 'Prepared Firefighters' (for the most part effective disaster responders) and the 'Disaster Averters' (who experienced a paradigm shift and moved focus away from the hazard itself towards a reduction of the underlying risk factors that cause disasters). Through extensive data mining, interviews and qualitative country assessments, we map where African countries lie on this spectrum of effective climate-related disaster risk management.We find that African countries lay at different levels on the spectrum of effective disaster risk management. Across Africa, countries display differential progress in achieving the Hyogo Framework for Action goals and great variation and heterogeneity exists from country to country, one that calls for a concomitant heterogeneity in aid programs and initiatives meant to support comprehensive disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation (DRR-CCA) in Africa.In closing, this paper suggests ways to support African countries' efforts towards effective disaster risk management and planning. It offers a qualitative method to continually assess developing countries' progress in achieving the Hyogo Framework for Action goals, one that straddles top-down country self-reporting and bottom-up civil society assessment. © 2013 The Authors.",0.1487008488436885,0.4076246534837908,0.15456697617608767,0.30656862884852465,0.14915222916630003,0.14822594354257346,0.21675084331415195
Climate adaptation in the public health sector in Africa: Evidence from United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change National Communications,"Climate change has potential to affect human health in various ways. Extreme temperatures and cold both result in deaths, while the changing habitats favouring the breeding of vectors could result in the spread of diseases such as malaria, cholera and typhus. This article reviews climate change adaptation measures in the African public health sector. The evidence is drawn from National Communications of 21 countries as submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This article combines the literature review and grounded theory approaches with data obtained from the UNFCCC National Communications. Among key adaptation measures emerging from the work are weather-based forecasting and early warning systems, public education and awareness, putting in place appropriate policies, surveillance, research and monitoring as well as improving public health infrastructure and technology. The study recommends that African nations should commit to address health impacts of climate change through the implementation of appropriate adaptation measures.",0.2738495227517571,0.4544828431476816,0.18698991587449082,0.20644332550601982,0.07922777453834033,0.1846890053045098,0.0851226450403664

Advancing climate compatible development: lessons from southern Africa,"Climate compatible development (CCD) has emerged as a new concept that bridges climate change adaptation, mitigation and community-based development. Progress towards CCD requires multi-stakeholder, multi-sector working and the development of partnerships between actors who may not otherwise have worked together. This creates challenges and opportunities that require careful examination at project and institutional levels and necessitates the sharing of experiences between different settings. In this paper, we draw on the outcomes from a multi-stakeholder workshop held in Mozambique in 2012, the final in a series of activities in a regional project assessing emerging CCD partnerships across southern Africa. The workshop involved policymakers, researchers and representatives from NGOs and the private sector. We employ a content analysis of workshop notes and presentations to identify the progress and challenges in moving four case study countries (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe) towards CCD pathways, by exploring experiences from both project and policy levels. To advance institutional support for the development of successful CCD policies, practices and partnerships, we conclude that there is a need for: (a) institutional development at the national level to strengthen coordination and more clearly define roles and responsibilities across sectors, based on the identification of capacity and knowledge gaps; (b) partnership development, drawing on key strengths and competences of different stakeholders and emphasising the roles of the private sector and traditional authorities; (c) learning and knowledge-sharing through national and regional fora; and (d) development of mechanisms that permit more equitable and transparent distribution of costs and benefits. These factors can facilitate development of multi-stakeholder, multi-level partnerships that are grounded in community engagement from the outset, helping to translate CCD policy statements into on-the-ground action.",0.15050948663108288,0.34145488282075553,0.14029565557517595,0.3442208649149496,0.13060384662638708,0.15672895903833034,0.1615829773479635
Regional response to climate change and management: an analysis of Africa's capacity,"Purpose - The mainstream climate change community has primarily concerned itself with mitigation and adaptation strategies, both of which require monitoring and prediction. These four inter-connected response actions (mitigation, adaptation, monitoring and prediction) constitute the main strategies for managing climate change. This paper aims to weigh in on policies and societal coordination for effective management of the earth's climate with respect to these four elements in Africa because of its socioeconomic peculiarities. Design/methodology/approach - The Delphi experts' method backed by questionnaires was used to obtain relevant data for the study. The questionnaires were distributed to professionals dealing with issues related to climate change response and sustainability in various parts of the world, with a focus on Africa. Findings - With respect to the strategies that are most needed for effective climate change actions in Africa, government's policies, activities and decisions rank highest at 1.20 with a p-value of < 0.001, and financing is next at 0.93, mitigation is 0.83, prediction is 0.76 and adaptation is 0.68 (p = 0.048), at the 5 per cent cutoff. Also, for the most appropriate approaches to managing climate change across Africa, regional efforts are at least 8 times more effective than country-wide approaches, followed by continental efforts at 6.51 times, international cooperation at 3.99 times and inaction at 0.00 times. Originality/value - The paper concludes that a holistic climate change management approach is important in Africa to contain the impacts of climate change in the continent.",0.44494369498479575,0.31879928831192295,0.1019357521869584,0.40895558768214163,0.04811420108051115,0.15632401929325226,0.0674708478443273
"Variable adaptations: Micro-politics of environmental displacement in the Okavango Delta, Botswana","Increasing environmental variability associated with global climate change is expected to produce social instability and human displacement in future decades. As such, there remains a pressing need to understand the implications of environmental changes for human populations and their adaptive capacities. This paper analyzes governmental and intra-community responses to environmental variability through a case study from the Okavango Delta, Botswana. We report findings from fieldwork conducted during May June 2011 and October 2012 May 2013 in the village of Etsha 13. Following an increase in annual flooding in 2009, 2010, and 2011, the Government of Botswana permanently relocated hundreds of residents to a nearby dryland area, asserting that this new settlement was necessary to reduce future risks from flooding variability. While some residents accepted this position, others elected to return to the floodplain or to illegally divert the flow of the water to protect their homes. This paper explores the micro-politics of these relocation efforts and competing responses in order to examine differential adaptive responses to increased flooding levels. We situate these findings within the burgeoning literature on transformative adaptation and suggest that micro-political dynamics are critical in shaping the limitations to, and possibilities for, effective adaptive responses to global environmental change.

"Farming transitions under Socio-economic and climatic constraints in the southern part of Setif, Algeria","This study was carried out on a sample of 224 farms in the southern region of Setif-Algeria, aimed to identify the different typologies and the agricultural changes caused by the climatic constrains experienced in last three decades. Indeed, the combined effect of climatic and anthropogenic factors on agricultural practices transitions is too tangled. A series of multivariate and classification statistical analysis have been implemented to demonstrate the main trends and adaptation strategies of farmers in such conditions. The farming characterization analysis showed that the medium scale farming was more economically efficient than small and large scale farming. Moreover, the study showed the effect of climate change on some farming transitions, where farming practices transited to bovine and poultry farming as well as for market gardening cultivation. Indeed, these changes occurred at the expense of rainfed agriculture (cereals) and ovine breeding. These transitions have impacted the economic performance of farms in some municipalities. However, greenhouse crops and tobacco cultivation were observed as being a Local Production Systems (LPS) that could be a good alternative to mitigate the natural and socioeconomic constraints. The emergence of LPS in an agricultural system may facilitate farmer adaptation that will provide a tool for agricultural development policies, through financial and technical assistance.",0.9618441111838085,0.14942884164004563,0.09438829819159239,0.4849916468627014,0.03672460769871716,0.025555683387053753,0.01332352658629849
"Defying the odds: Climate variability, asset adaptation and food security nexus in the Delta State of Nigeria","There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that the adverse impacts of climate variability and change is making it increasingly difficult for the poor rural populations, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to continue engaging in meaningful agriculture and obtain secure livelihoods. This is, partly, because agricultural productivity in SSA is highly dependent on rainfall. Thus, the slightest variation in climatic conditions has the potential of subjecting a large proportion of the rural poor to increased poverty and misery as the ability to obtain their livelihoods can be compromised. Despite the effects of climate variability on rural livelihoods, the rural poor are not passive actors. They are actively and consistently involved in adapting and modifying their asset portfolios to reduce the impacts of climate variability, and consequently, build their adaptive capacity and resilience. Drawing on a recent field-based research conducted in the Delta State of Nigeria and using the participatory climate change adaptation appraisal, this paper discusses the various asset adaptation strategies employed by the rural poor in building their adaptive capacity and resilience to climate variability. These issues have been explored in the broader theoretical debates revolving around climate change adaptation and food security in countries of the developing South.",0.8359566381606532,0.3191388020901232,0.10315821497224291,0.6980599834082419,0.04126118932189463,0.037820547922780355,0.07004245362096462
Understanding climate change adaptation in Africa: key considerations,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to synthesise lessons from research on adaptation to demonstrate that African countries can explore the opportunities and challenges inherent in climate variability and change. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a review work which synthesises lessons from relevant journal articles and other related documents. The literature was retrieved from Google and Google Scholar using search terms such as climate change, climate change and mitigation, climate change and mitigation in Africa, climate change adaptation and mitigation in Africa, climate change vulnerability, climate change impacts, among others. Various combinations of the search terms were also deployed. The journals were subjected to critical review and key lessons synthesised from them and reflections on their future implications in relation to climate risks and vulnerability presented. Findings - Key lessons were synthesised and reflections on their future implications in relation to climate risks and vulnerability were presented. The evidence seems to suggest that countries in Africa recognise that it is time for them to take action on the impacts of climate change. The key lessons which emerge, going forward, are that climate change adaptation should be mainstreamed into development plans of nations. All efforts should be geared towards sustaining livelihoods of people. Key stakeholders also have a role to play in adaptation. The paper has indicated that although a lot has happened, there are areas that require strengthening and that should be the focus and priority of change and policy makers for the future. Research limitations/implications - The paper is a synthesis and reflection of existing literature and it is possible that some of the dynamics may have changed since the paper was published. Practical implications - The dynamics of climate change adaptation is understood. The approaches to adaptation are also explored. Areas worth prioritising in the discourse of adaptation studies have also been indicated. Originality/value - The syntheses provided are the reflections of the author. The views of the researcher provide insights and understanding into the current adaptation debate.",0.5207524047596884,0.39876832526012135,0.07615395692203246,0.2902941445628843,0.06167192033318763,0.1439311830773952,0.0745046912306146
"Adaptation as by-product: migration and environmental change in Nguith, Senegal","In the debate about the nexus between environmental change, climate and migration much attention has been given to a changing climate as a push factor for migration. A more recent strand of academic work focuses on migration as a means to enhance adaptation capacities and resilience, This article questions these intentional attributions and starts from the observation that migration is occurring regardless of environmental or climatic change and connects people and places through shared social and cultural identities and the flow of ideas and resources. Drawing on a case study of Nguith, a village in the Senegalese Sahel with a long and complex migration history, it is shown how migration and material and non-material remittances have led (in a way accidentally) to an increased independence from local agro-ecological conditions. Therefore, we investigate the social, cultural and historical background of the people of Nguith with regard to their mobility and trace the continents-traversing migration network and connected translocal spaces. Finally, we explain the cohesive forces of this community that perpetuate and reinforce migration and show the effects of migration on everyday life, economic development in the village and resulting land-use change.",0.18449247435076027,0.6184220504552453,0.1326812022091425,0.5437973985905736,0.197739363357943,0.051306057034791124,0.06892711915867902
How Do Farmers' Climate Change Beliefs Affect Adaptation to Climate Change?,"This exploratory study aims to examine (1) the reasons for farmers' range of climate change beliefs and (2) how those beliefs affect their climate change adaptation responses. Interviews with 11 key-informant irrigators from the South Australian Riverland uncovered skepticism about climate change predictions. Interviewees mostly believed changes to the climate were not human-induced but were a result of natural cycles, which meant that they then felt less obliged to undertake climate-change adaptation responses. With low water allocations and low commodity prices, most did not identify climate change as their most compelling problem. They found it hard to identify climate change adaptation options beyond those they had implemented to manage their immediate problems. The reasons for interviewees' stated skepticism are complex, but not as equated to disbelief as they might seem. Their beliefs about climate change appear to be chosen to allow them to retain hope for the future.",0.5499587206473607,0.31774893431401885,0.10763973687006834,0.25616922702744377,0.08003280528642617,0.07194417380048414,0.13938575928381275
"Identifying trade-offs between adaptation, mitigation and development in community responses to climate and socio-economic stresses: Evidence from Zanzibar, Tanzania","In this paper, we examine how communities in Zanzibar cope with and adapt to multiple-stressors including climate change, and how these responses affect long-term adaptation, mitigation and development (AMD) goals. In particular, we identify the multiple-stressors that affect natural-resource dependent communities in Zanzibar. We then explore how community responses affect long-term development and mitigation goals before we examine the barriers to maximising AMD synergies in community responses. We use the DPSIR (Drivers - Pressures - States - Impacts - Response) as a tool to organise the complex information relating to both the marine and terrestrial SES in Zanzibar. Using data from household surveys and community-level focus groups, we find that responses to stressors resemble coping strategies as they provide short-term relief but in the long-term may negatively affect development goals. Furthermore, responses generate a trade-off between adaptation, mitigation and development. For example, when farmers respond to low productivity by spending longer on the farm, there is a development trade-off as time burdens are increased, and a mitigation trade-off as secondary forest cannot be established. We identify that AMD compatible responses are constrained by resource, regulatory, learning and governance barriers. We conclude that without local climate policy intervention, 'mal-adaptations', which threaten both mitigation and development goals, could occur across a range of temporal and spatial scales.

"Limits to climate change adaptation in Zimbabwe: Insights, experiences and lessons","The need to climate proof Zimbabwe’s socio-economic development sectors is now a central theme in the country’s climate policy discourse. This stems from the realisation that most of the country’s areas and sectors are already showing signs of vulnerability to the change and variability in the climate system. Accordingly, climate change adaptation is no longer an option but an urgent requirement. However, scholarly attention to the topic has largely remained fragmented in synchrony with the segmented sectoral policy interventions in various adaptation efforts. Research that analyses the major factors underpinning successful adaptation is highly timely given that most of the empirical evidence point towards gaps in adaptive capacities across the country’s climate sensitive sectors. Driven by the acknowledgement that Zimbabwe’s adaptation efforts are chiefly stymied by its predisposition to non-climatic drivers of vulnerability, this paper shows that the country is already showing numerous signs of limits to adaptation. It draws the evidence from various insights and experiences in the agriculture, water, human settlements and health, energy and industry, and biodiversity sectors. Specifically, this report serves to document existing evidence of challenges in successful adaptation in order to guide adaptation policy and practice. In addition, it is intended that this illumination would provide Zimbabwe and other countries, in similar adaptation failure milieu, to formulate strategies meant to build resilience in areas and sectors already showing signs of maladaptation. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",0.3670277997262041,0.35591678825326173,0.13258359613159926,0.3892385330638362,0.09288931696177959,0.08713051197749117,0.11852090052433238
Comparing Smallholder Farmers' Perception of Climate Change with Meteorological Data: Experience from Seven Agroecological Zones of Tanzania,"This paper examines and compares smallholder farmers' perceptions of climate change with the collected meteorological data (1980-2015) across the seven agroecological zones (AEZs) of Tanzania. Systematic and simple random sampling procedures were employed in the selection of districts and villages, respectively. This study used both quantitative and qualitative datasets. Quantitative data were derived from climatic records and questionnaires, while the qualitative data were widely derived from interviews and discussions. The Mann-Kendall test (software) and theme content (method) were used for data analyses. The results showed that rain has experienced a significant change in terms of patterns, frequency, and intensity, while temperature was locally increasing in all the AEZs. Moreover, the farmers' responses to both closed and open questions indicated that most of them (>70%) noticed these alterations. Comparatively, the farmers residing in the most vulnerable AEZs, that is, arid and semiarid lands, were more responsive and sensitive to climatic impacts than those in the least vulnerable zones, such as alluvial regions. The increase in temperature and change in the rain patterns led to the decrease in crop yields. As a response to this, farmers have adopted new strategies such as early planting and the use of shorter growing crops cultivars. This study concludes that, although farmers' perceptions were correct and echoed the meteorological/measured data in all the AEZs, adaptation and mitigation strategies are inadequate.",0.9658073785508111,0.19810634016895837,0.05820488916828621,0.541614472561877,0.03150439441333018,0.012090472303741863,0.02667625707215552
Conservation Agriculture to buffer and alleviate the impact of climatic variations in Madagascar: farmers' perception,"Conservation Agriculture (CA) has been promoted during the last 15 years in Madagascar to develop a sustainable rainfed agriculture in order to cope with low fertility upland soils, soil erosion, low productivity and erratic rainfall. If CA does provide a better sustainability with adapted cropping patterns when adopted, a question is, whether CA is able to alleviate the impact of climatic variations thanks to the mulching effect and to which extent. We took the example of medium altitude zones in the Lake Alaotra area to illustrate farmers' perceptions. If climate change is not proven in these areas, climatic variations are very high and erratic rainfall patterns at the beginning of the rainy season induce serious risks of crop failure. Two surveys were implemented in 2013: (i) on CA changing practices of 92 farmers (during the 10 years project duration) and (ii) on the evolution of behavior among 28 farmers who have recently adopted CA (less than 5 years). In CA systems, the mulch contributes to better cropping systems resilience and helps alleviating the effect of climatic variations. If a limited number of farmers have effectively adopted CA practices, in the long run, most farmers have developed innovative cropping systems between conventional agriculture and CA, to address their own constraints, leading to a widespread range of agro-ecological practices. A typology of behavior is presented to identify farmers' strategies regarding risks in a context characterized by multiple uncertainties.",0.9698992205790011,0.13872768055662593,0.08888479609020457,0.4873212129717546,0.014025077282894085,0.017619178540055305,0.011530529555941785
"Understanding watershed dynamics and impacts of climate change and variability in the Pangani River Basin, Tanzania","Watersheds and rivers are vital ecological features for the provision of hydrological services for the health, welfare and prosperity of human communities. Nevertheless, anthropogenic activities coupled with climate change and climate variability are blamed for degrading watersheds and rivers and decreasing their capacity to irrigate. To address the situation, it is important to understand why and how water shortages are occurring. This paper reports findings of a study carried out to identify and assess drivers of water shortages and adaptation strategies to climate change and variability in Pangani River Basin of Tanzania. To assess the influence of climate change and variability on hydrological flow and water shortages, time series data on rainfall and temperature were compiled from the Tanzania Meteorological Agency. We also used structured questionnaires to collect data on villagers' perceptions about the drivers of water shortages and adaptation strategies. Results indicated a decreasing trend of water flow (p < 0.05) at Kikuletwa-Karangai gauging station along Pangani River Basin. Trend analysis indicated a slight decrease of rainfall and increase of temperature. Although there is no empirical evidence to associate climate change with the decline of rainfall and water flow, adaptation measures need to be put in place in order to mitigate against increasing climate variability, reduced water flow, and projected climate change. Therefore, watershed conservation strategies should also focus on improving the welfare of local communities. Additionally, involvement of stakeholders in the entire PRB is crucial toward watersheds conservation for steady flow of hydrological services.

The role of farmers' perceptions in coping with climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Global climate change represents one of the most important challenges of modern times, and policy makers have a crucial role to play in the definition of policies to tackle it. In terms of Africa, the priority is to explore the means to help African policy makers - at the national level - to deal with uncertainties relating to climate change. This also includes assistance in defining the right adaptation policies. Indeed, among specific stakeholders such as farmers, perceptions of climate change are translated into decisions pertaining to agricultural practice and with regard to their autonomous adaptation strategies. These should, ideally, be based on sound scientific information so as to positively impact them.",0.6973944357278405,0.31556046783224445,0.12159035912171766,0.4125062147230555,0.0686330330720206,0.07325798275104016,0.15343806763319942
Farmers' perspectives on climate change manifestations in smallholder cocoa farms and shifts in cropping systems in the forest-savannah transitional zone of Ghana,"The study was conducted to explore actual manifestations of climate change in smallholder cocoa farms to aid extension response to climate impacts, and to understand the reasons for a renewed interest in cocoa production in the forest-savanna agro ecological landscape in Ghana, in spite of unfavorable climatic conditions. Two hundred cocoa farmers were interviewed in nine cocoa farming communities. Selected farms were also visited to document on-farm manifestation of climate impacts as well as innovations and strategies farmers are employing to respond to the adverse impacts of climate change on their cocoa systems. The results revealed various manifestations of climate impacts on cocoa farms which included, increased incidence of pests and diseases, wilting of cocoa leaves, high mortality of cocoa seedlings which affected expansion and farm rehabilitation, and wilting of cherelles resulting in low yield. The farmers maintained that their response to the immediate impacts of climate on cocoa was a shift to cereals due to the unpredictable climatic patterns and the shortened duration of rainfall. However, a combination of storage and supply chain challenges and low returns from cereal production, coupled with land scarcity in the Western Region, where most of them are migrant fanners accounted for their decision to return to cocoa production lately. It was observed, among other adaptive responses, that some farmers plant about three times the plantain suckers they usually plant, to provide a dense temporary shade over cocoa seedlings, and resort to planting more cocoa seedlings randomly per unit area on new farms, contrary to recommended planting approach, as a form of insurance against seedling mortality. More importantly, a community-based fire response system was identified to be a major safeguard mechanism to the threat of fire. Clearly, the farmers are not replanting cocoa in the forest-savanna agro ecological landscape because it is more productive than cereals, but they believe that a low yielding cocoa is far better than a productive cereal cropping systems that offer low returns when compared to cocoa. The study brings out the sustainable livelihood challenges of the rural farmer within the context of a changing climate for appropriate policy response.",0.9153067239068097,0.2376713718567506,0.11791398042336457,0.4764371642675848,0.0313331913437707,0.01675316337371021,0.02747874145071816
"A socio-economic evaluation of community-based adaptation: A case study in Dakoro, Niger","Community-based adaptation (CBA) is gaining popularity as an approach to supporting vulnerable communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change, but in an environment of competing financial demands, to what extent is CBA economically efficient? Empirical research from NEF Consulting (New Economics Foundation) using an extended social cost-benefit analysis (SCBA) of qualitative and quantitative data gathered from four communities compares and contrasts the benefits and investment in CBA initiatives carried out by the Adaptation Learning Programme (ALP), implemented by CARE International in Dakoro, Niger. The results suggest a high return on investment on ALP’s CBA activities in Dakoro and an increase in the economic capital of communities (revenue and savings) as well as social and environmental capitals. Even only taking into account the benefits ALP has generated to date (over 4 years), findings suggest that for every £1 invested in communities, there has been a return of more than £4. In order to capture the future value of community-based adaptation, the evaluative model was extended further to forecast evolutions to 2020 using three core climate scenarios to evaluate the impact on the different forms of communities’ capital under a no intervention scenario, compared to an intervention scenario. Even under a high discount rate, results remain positive and returns are high, proving that CBA is both an economic and socially effective approach to adaptation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",0.2790853087517977,0.40230127900768414,0.14234438519636072,0.4004884285427863,0.12496186017779656,0.08157980823610912,0.2829462244987119
Constraints and Limits to Climate Change Adaptation Efforts in Nigeria,"Nigeria is experiencing adverse climate conditions with negative impacts on the welfare of millions of people. Persistent droughts and flooding, off season rains and dry spells have sent growing seasons out of track, in a country dependent on a rain-fed agriculture. The result is reduced water supplies for use in agriculture, hydro power generation and other users. It is widely believed that climate change is responsible for all these as reported in the 4th IPCC Assessment Report, which suggests that Africa will be worst hit by the effects of climate change of which Nigeria is a part. Farmers were facing a lot of climate change induced challenges on their farms of which flooding, erratic rainfall, high temperature and low crop yield are the most prominent. The Nigerian government have made efforts to curtail these challenges by promoting various adaptation measures. These include provision of improved crop varieties, fertilizers, irrigation schemes and geo-data. Most of these measures are not well received by the farmers due to cultural and religious sentiments, illiteracy, language barrier and unwillingness to change mode of farming. The paper assessed the adaptation measures and the barriers of adoption and proffered solutions for acceptance. The results of the study will be beneficial for agricultural ministries, departments and agencies in Nigeria and Sub-Sahara Africa. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",0.875038416660934,0.22838938650904003,0.10167522270231395,0.4148185016781424,0.04038685021665984,0.07107256922795382,0.1437555947851358
Overview of flood management actions and policy planning in Bangladesh,"Flood is a critical issue in Bangladesh. Regular flooding affects 20% of the country, increasing in extreme years. Various measures, policy planning and actions have been taken in different time period. Legislation and policy planning are essential for flood management, which should be guided by distinct policy, strategies, legal frameworks, and action planning. A review of legislative and institutional arrangements is required for effective and sustainable flood management. In this research, the evolution of flood management actions and policies is reviewed considering the related environmental and social changes. The approach to flood management is shifting to a more comprehensive risk reduction effort following environmental changes such as climate change. Extreme floods are increasing. The history of extreme flood management is short compared to that of annual flood management. However, extreme floods have significant impacts. Thus, a holistic approach by all stakeholders is encouraged. This review could help to examine how to increase local involvement in flood control and water management projects. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",0.08025533992077238,0.381236110301367,0.18955679957522073,0.17134479015419396,0.19867373887367645,0.6578695492406688,0.9028349987031108

Scarcity to solution: perceived reasons for safe drinking water scarcity and local coping responses in a coastal village of Bangladesh,"People are directly and indirectly exposed to changing weather patterns through changes in the quality of water, air, and food changes in ecosystems, agriculture, industry, human settlements and the economy. Hence, this study explored local perceived reasons for safe drinking water scarcity and under such circumstances the coping responses in their region. This is a descriptive study based on qualitative methods. Male and female informants (30 + years of age) were purposively identified and data for the study were collected in three ways, through observation and informal discussion, in-depth interviews (n = 18), and three focus group discussions in a coastal village of Bangladesh. Climate change consequences include damaged trees and increased salinity intrusion, leading to a scarcity of safe drinking water. To cope with such scarcity of water, small scale road side mangrove tree planting was found to protect fresh water from salt water. In addition, cost effective rainwater preservation in the community during the rainy season was taken as mitigation of the scarcity of safe drinking water. Considering the geographical and socio-economic context of any specific region, cost effective and environment friendly local adaptive measures can reduce or mitigate the impact of climate change on water resources.",0.6919329699975335,0.2859497910116342,0.14460824778172238,0.332741857289071,0.07533344509017191,0.06851174892895419,0.8421150011197776
Farmer's Response to Changing Climate in North East India,"Diversification of land use in the cultivation of various crops provides an alternative way to moderate the climate risk. By choosing alternative crops that are resilient to various weather parameters, farmers can reduce the crop damage and achieve optimum output from their limited land resources. Apart from other adaptation measures, crop diversity can reflect farmers' response towards changing climate uncertainty. This paper tries to examine the changing climatic condition through spatio-temporal variation of two important weather variables (precipitation and temperature) in the largest North-East Indian state, Assam, since 1950. It is examined by the variation in crop diversification index. We have used (1) Herfindahl Index for measuring degree of diversification and (2) locational quotient for measuring the changes in the regional crop concentration. The results show that, in almost all the districts, crop specialization has been taking place slowly and that happened mostly in the last phase of our study. The hilly and backward districts recorded more diversification but towards lower value crops. It goes against the normal feature of crop diversification where farmers diversify in favour of high value crops. Employing ordinary least squares method and/or Fixed Effect model, irrigation is found to have significant impact on crop diversification; while the flood plain zones and hill zones are found to have better progress in this regard, which has been due to the survival necessity of poor farmers living the zone. Thus crop diversity does not reflect very significant response from the farmers' side towards changing weather factors (except rainfall) though they have significant impact on the productivity of various crops, and thus profitability. The study thus suggests the necessity for rapid and suitable diversification as alternative climate change mitigation in the long run.",0.9469788613541998,0.19882652307588275,0.06548124318381211,0.5299341894262716,0.054929236225896544,0.029906300406858866,0.05512325693718065
Community based initiatives to mainstream climate change adaptation into disaster risk reduction: evidence from the Hunter Valley (Australia),"In Australia, local communities often enact Community-Based Initiatives (CBIs) to respond to climate change through Climate Change Adaptation (CCA). CBIs can also be integrated into the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) agenda. The paper explores the extent to which CBIs promote the mainstreaming of CCA into DRR. Primary data were obtained from interviews with representatives of CBIs and supporting organisations in three local governments of the Hunter Valley (New South Wales, Australia). Findings show that CBIs recognise the potential contribution of climate change in modifying the local hazard profile. CBIs mainstream CCA into DRR by following four approaches: environmental and social justice; sustainability and transition; ecosystem-based approach; and adaptive planning. Partnerships were identified both among CBIs and between CBIs and City Councils; however, conflicts between CBIs, City Councils and business actors emerged, and a lack of commitment by multi-level governments in responding to climate change was revealed. The findings show that CBIs consider CCA and DRR within a broad everyday context related to vulnerability and local development. But we argue that assigning responsibility for climate change issues to CBIs is not a panacea and should not be the only local climate change response. Instead, CBIs need to be included in a larger and long-term commitment by actors that possess access to resources, such as higher levels of government. The paper provides a local Australian perspective on the effectiveness of mainstreaming CCA into DRR and furthers the conversation for the benefit of other communities facing similar challenges.",0.23277851395865548,0.3858328684746403,0.1309777633517907,0.2872909023176815,0.10639398606828887,0.19519663208892124,0.32203680281987057
"Drought and the future of rural communities: Opportunities and challenges for climate change adaptation in regional Victoria, Australia","Australia's vulnerability to climate variability and change has been highlighted by the recent drought (i.e. the Big Dry or Millennium Drought), and also recent flooding across much of eastern Australia during 2011 and 2012. There is also the possibility that the frequency, intensity and duration of droughts may increase due to anthropogenic climate change, stressing the need for robust drought adaptation strategies. This study investigates the socio-economic impacts of drought, past and present drought adaptation measures, and the future adaptation strategies required to deal with projected impacts of climate change. The qualitative analysis presented records the actual experiences of drought and other climatic extremes and helps advance knowledge of how best to respond and adapt to such conditions, and how this might vary between different locations, sectors and communities. It was found that more effort is needed to address the changing environment and climate, by shifting from notions of 'drought-as-crisis' towards acknowledging the variable availability of water and that multi-year droughts should not be unexpected, and may even become more frequent. Action should also be taken to revalue the farming enterprise as critical to our environmental, economic and cultural well-being and there was also strong consensus that the value of water should be recognised in a more meaningful way (i.e. not just in economic terms). Finally, across the diverse stakeholders involved in the research, one point was consistently reiterated: that 'it's not just drought'. Exacerbating the issues of climate impacts on water security and supply is the complexity of the agriculture industry, global economics (in particular global markets and the recent/ongoing global financial crisis), and demographic changes (decreasing and ageing populations) which are currently occurring across most rural communities. The social and economic issues facing rural communities are not just a product of drought or climate change - to understand them as such would underestimate the extent of the problems and inhibit the ability to coordinate the holistic, cross-agency approach needed for successful climate change adaptation in rural communities.

Tourist adaptation behavior in response to climate disasters in Bangladesh,"To assess the impacts of climate disasters on the behavior of tourists in Bangladesh, this study makes an initial attempt to investigate tourists' adaptation behavior in response to climate disasters. A questionnaire survey was developed and administered to address both tourists' previous adaptation behavior and their stated adaptation behavior in response to different future climate disasters. The choice modeling analysis of tourists' previous behavior revealed that a cyclone is more likely to result in the cancellation of a trip, and a flood is more likely to result in a change in trip timing. As for the stated behavior analysis, it was confirmed that most variables related to disaster severity show significant influence on adaptation behavior. The results also indicate that construction of disaster-resilient transportation networks is essential to avoid trip cancellations. In addition, improving market-oriented tourism service quality in Bangladesh could play a significant role in reducing the probability of both trip cancellations and changes of destination. The findings of this study can provide the tourism industry in Bangladesh with critical insights for future disaster management and sustainable development of the tourism industry.",0.21917097057763732,0.3524666338212798,0.13287189986101627,0.3522795815424499,0.09157478953549744,0.07596249576448556,0.11564408756280382
Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EbA) for Coastal Resilience Against Water Related Disasters in Bangladesh,"Since the publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment report (MEA in Ecosystems and human well-being: wetlands and water synthesis. World Resources Institute, Washington, DC, 2005), ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) has appeared as a popular strategy for adaptation to the impacts of climate change. In Bangladesh, people have been adapting to climatic disasters in various ways for long. There exist valuable narratives about many ways of adaptation, yet only sporadic attempts have been observed to analyse the effectiveness of EbA. In fact, there is a clear lack of research that addresses the effectiveness of EbA against water related disasters and the challenges the EbA encounters. This chapter fills these gaps in knowledge in three ways. Firstly, it presents an overview of the vulnerability of coastal social-ecological systems to water related disasters against which increased adoption of EbA has been observed in coastal Bangladesh. Secondly, it examines the status and role of EbA in three distinct coastal regions. Thirdly, it presents an array of factors that put limits on the adoption and functions of EbA in coastal Bangladesh. Finally, it offers some policy suggestions to enhance the effectiveness of EbA. This chapter heavily draws on a review of most recent published and other grey literature on EbA. Most commonly adopted EbAs are mangrove afforestation, wetland restoration, tropical green-belt, hydroponic agriculture, and integrated agriculture and aquaculture. These EbAs build resilience through buffering water related disasters, controlling erosion, recycling nutrients, and offering other co-benefits. The factors that put the limit on the effectiveness of EbA are broadly biophysical, socio-economic, technological, and institutional. In line with the suggestions, initiatives could be taken to make EbA more effective. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",0.34141291157799014,0.3624115865424536,0.18442684619702576,0.322243309215164,0.18422651005340865,0.19103629012902004,0.26369459957725006

Enabling environments? Insights into the policy context for climate change and health adaptation decision-making in Cambodia,"Changes in climatic conditions and increases in weather variability affect human health directly and indirectly, including through agricultural changes and urban warming. Adaptation to climate change is receiving increasing attention, given, now, the inevitability of further climate change and its diverse impacts. However, with increased international funding for adaptation comes challenges such as ensuring supportive national policy environments for developing and implementing effective adaptation activities. Adaptation at community and population levels is underpinned by governance processes, such as the nature by which decisions are taken and implemented by government, community and private organizations. Thus an understanding of the policy context is necessary to identify the factors that enable or inhibit adaptation policy and programmes. This article examines to what degree there exist enabling factors to support the development of adaptation policy and activities, with relevance to the health sector. Results of a policy analysis are presented, which used stakeholder participation to investigate the context in which adaptation decisions were made within organizations across different sectors in Cambodia. Five factors were identified as critical components of the governance environment: (1) policy development processes; (2) the existence of a political recognition of climate change and (3-5) the organizational barriers relating to coordination, funding and lack of information. Without achieving a supportive policy environment, future adaptation actions are likely to have limited effect.",0.18767339032619126,0.4256297206100248,0.11530609077104922,0.27641759951727296,0.06151282366582718,0.16015728888509775,0.06489888673960414

"Turning water into wine: Exploring water security perceptions and adaptation behaviour amongst conventional, organic and biodynamic grape growers","Australian irrigators regularly experience drought conditions, placing water security as a critical issue facing agriculture, especially for permanent plantings such as grapes. This study explores irrigators' water security perceptions and their water management adaptation behaviour using in-depth interviews and surveys with 37 conventional, organic and biodynamic grape growers in South Australia. Conventional growers' water adaptation behaviour was primarily reliant on activities external to the vineyard (e.g. upgrading irrigation infrastructure); whereas alternative (i.e. certified organic/biodynamic) growers' water security actions were based largely on internal vineyard activities (e.g. agro-ecological methods). Conventional growers often named governance and district physical capital as influencing their adaptive capacity to water scarcity, while alternative growers focussed more on the role of human, social, and farm soil and land capital in influencing their farm adaptive capacity. Two-thirds of surveyed alternative growers converted away from conventional production at the end of the Millennium Drought, naming water security issues as their main reason. Overall alternative growers perceived higher water security and less water vulnerability due to higher soil water retention. Findings suggest a need for current Murray-Darling Basin water policy to seriously reconsider the approach of primarily investing money in irrigation infrastructure to save water and to focus more on agro-ecological methods.",0.8398429413451356,0.21612992059083355,0.18297287871782222,0.271636106050399,0.027831636110626883,0.08255831455075308,0.8928833833070624
Adaptation in a transboundary river basin: Linking stressors and adaptive capacity within the Mekong River Commission,"River basin organizations serve as potential forums to promote adaptation to environmental change in transboundary river basins. Yet how these organizations adapt is an understudied area of the literature. We explore and compare four examples of adaptation within the Mekong River Commission (MRC), focusing on how the nature of stressors shapes adaptation responses. We measure adaptation responses in terms of adaptive capacity, which includes technical, institutional, social and financial capacity. We find that the uncertainty of the impact of stressors plays a role in shaping the extent of adaptive capacity. We also find that the adaptive response may depend on a river basin organization's pre-existing capacity to address the stressor. Finally, our research suggests that investments in new capacity can create a feedback mechanism that helps reduce uncertainty and foster further adaptation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Coastal household adaptation cost requirements to sea level rise impacts,"This study assessed the autonomous adaptation cost requirements of coastal households to sea level rise impacts at a level to accommodate and protect (excluding retreat). The study examined six vulnerable villages, including both urbanized and fishery communities, located in the Gulf of Thailand. Half of them were near the shore, and the other half were further inland. In initiating the study, to assess actual adaptation costs, common household adaptative measures were first identified; then, using a questionnaire to collect associated costs data, interviews were conducted with individual households. To predict future adaptation costs, the study applied the budgeting for recurrent costs of investment and the future value of an equal annual expenditures payment. Adaptation costs were classified into capital and operating expenditures. Then a statistical comparison was completed of the mean differences in costs between the villages. The study results indicate that the impacted households primarily spent their money for capital expenditures related to home and farming environments. Operating expenditures are not a concern for them. The expected future adaptation costs adjusted with inflation throughout the next 30 years will be five times that of the present costs. This will require households to plan their savings very carefully. Whereas the adaptation costs of urbanized villages are clearly higher than those of fishery villages, there is no significant difference in the costs between near shore and next-to-shore villages. Information regarding adaptation costs at the household level is extremely rare. Knowing the requisite amount for the adaptation costs will be of added benefit to policy makers preparing for future assistance programs.",0.5172248042069645,0.303905744125396,0.07704811151552267,0.398099539524571,0.12352286461330583,0.15604232725555695,0.09262655810671169
"Culture, climate change and farm-level groundwater management: An Australian case study","Cultural factors - values, beliefs, and norms - provide important insights into the environmental attitudes, risk perceptions, and behaviors of the general population. Little is known, however, about the ostensibly complex relationships linking those elements of culture to climate change risk perceptions, especially in the context of farm level decision in the ground water context. This paper addresses that gap through an analysis of survey data provided by irrigators in the Namoi catchment of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin. We use Values-Beliefs-Norms theory to construct multivariate models of the relationship between ground water irrigators' interpretations of climate change risks and their implementation of adaptive water conservation practices. Results indicate that these cultural factors are important explanations of irrigators' climate change risk perceptions, and these risk perceptions are related to adaptive ground water management strategies at the farm level. The implications of the findings are discussed for research on the culture-environment nexus and for outreach designed to encourage agricultural adaptations to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Resilience and organisational institutionalism from a cross-cultural perspective: an exploration based on urban climate change adaptation in Vietnam,"Resilience theory has gained considerable prominence with regard to the management of social-ecological systems and more recently climate change adaptation. Yet, how resilience is precisely understood, how its institutionalisation works and how organisations can operationalise principles for achieving resilience often remains vague. Therefore, the paper explores how institutional and organisational theory can enhance the understanding on resilience. Linking organisational institutionalism to resilience theory, the paper analyses in particular how resilience thinking can diffuse and translate into organisational action, and which challenges and barriers may exist. Empirical research on formal urban climate change adaptation in Vietnam is used to explore the important role of distinctive institutional features in a given culture, region or sector for shaping this process. It is argued that such context-specific institutional framework conditions are often underemphasised, thereby, hampering the transferability as well as operationalisation and implementation of resilience propositions. Relevant aspects include epistemological, ontological and normative dimensions. Linking the case study to neoinstitutional theory, recommendations are developed for increasing the intercultural transferability of resilience thinking into organisational practices.",0.34805258731523286,0.47320795012034256,0.17744223389174707,0.30932723561129033,0.11204460820614968,0.1697792290217212,0.1624089203681154

Co-evolving dynamics in the social-ecological system of community forestry-prospects for ecosystem-based adaptation in the Middle Hills of Nepal,"This paper analyses prospects for ecosystem-based adaptation, through examining diverse forest-people interactions in Nepal's community forestry as a social-ecological system (SES). We examine the linkage between social-ecological resilience and societal adaptation in the Middle Hills of Nepal and, based on this, discuss the prospects of this system for climate adaptation. In doing so, we also discuss the prospects of community forestry for ecosystem-based adaptation in the rural agrarian context, focussing on a few attributes of resilience: diversity, modularity, and flexibility. We find that community forestry provides multiple pathways for both reactive and anticipatory adaptation, often reinforcing community resilience. Our finding also shows that, while ecological processes in community forestry (CF) are being managed by local institutions with an explicit goal to enhance the overall resilience of the SES, the underlying social and political dynamics of CF tend to be neglected in adaptation policy and planning. This prevents local organizations from harnessing the benefits of ecological resilience to enhance their adaptive capacity. The contribution of ecological resilience to societal adaptation has been constrained by large scale social and political drivers, especially bureaucratic structures underpinning the governance of forest in Nepal. Based on these findings, we recommend that ecosystem-based adaptation is fully informed by, and takes account of, local power dynamics. For instance, aligning governance and decision-making with the needs of marginalized groups can increase the resilience and adaptive capacity of social-ecological systems.",0.41257329804167947,0.45577931310770287,0.414566727660224,0.3628652255240502,0.15262187692914408,0.07822139595944466,0.13243496224327303
"The role of culture and traditional knowledge in climate change adaptation: Insights from East Kimberley, Australia","Indigenous peoples offer alternative knowledge about climate variability and change based on their own locally developed knowledges and practices of resource use. In this article we discuss the role of traditional ecological knowledge in monitoring and adapting to changing environmental conditions. Our case study documents a project to record the seasonal knowledge of the Miriwoong people in northern Australia. The study demonstrates how indigenous groups' accumulate detailed baseline information about their environment to guide their resource use and management, and develop worldviews and cultural values associated with this knowledge. We highlight how traditional ecological knowledge plays a critical role in mediating indigenous individuals and communities' understandings of environmental changes in the East Kimberley region of north-west Australia, and how these beliefs may influence future decision-making about how to go about adapting to climate change at a local level.

Communication and capacity building to advance adaptation strategies in agriculture in the context of climate change in India,"Climate change is perhaps the most serious issue that affects food security of a very large number of human beings and animals. Impacts of climate change will be particularly significant in South Asia where most of food production comes from smallholder farms. Vulnerability in this region is twofold: production of important food crop varieties may be affected by developments such as rise in temperature; smallholder farmers have low economic resilience when large variations in crop outputs occur. Both adaptive and anticipatory measures based on research in agricultural sciences are being proposed. What is also important is to build the capacity of smallholder farmers to cope with the impact of climate change-induced phenomena. Key guides to large-scale actions such as the UN Framework Convention for Climate Change propose integrated action for capacity building involving both top-down and bottom-up inputs. In this paper, we provide an overview of accepted impacts of climate change on agriculture and food security in South Asia, and the proposed and ongoing agronomic adaptation strategies in India. Our focus is on capacity building at a micro-level which can augment adaptation efforts. We offer two case studies that provide pointers for integrating novel communication and capacity building processes for smallholder farmers that can considerably improve their ability to engage in action for adaptation.",0.8828240932140293,0.2232248769716327,0.08579568738492586,0.4243447405541654,0.03806152273227784,0.05194599349380108,0.01972253051605129
Differential livelihood adaptation to social-ecological change in coastal Bangladesh,"Social-ecological changes, brought about by the rapid growth of the aquaculture industry and the increased occurrence of climatic stressors, have significantly affected the livelihoods of coastal communities in Asian mega-deltas. This paper explores the livelihood adaptation responses of households of different wealth classes, the heterogeneous adaptation opportunities, barriers and limits (OBLs) faced by these households and the dynamic ways in which these factors interact to enhance or impede adaptive capacities. A mixed methods approach was used to collect empirical evidence from two villages in coastal Bangladesh. Findings reveal that households' adaptive capacities largely depend on their wealth status, which not only determine their availability of productive resources, but also empower them to navigate social-ecological change in desirable ways. Households operate within a shared response space, which is shaped by the broader socio-economic and political landscape, as well as their previous decisions that can lock them in to particular pathways. While an adaptive response may be effective for one social group, it may cause negative externalities that can undermine the adaptation options and outcomes of another group. Adaptation OBLs interact in complex ways; the extent to which these OBLs affect different households depend on the specific livelihood activities being considered and the differential values and interests they hold. To ensure more equitable and environmentally sustainable livelihoods in future, policies and programs should aim to expand households' adaptation space by accounting for the heterogeneous needs and complex interdependencies between response processes of different groups.",0.5635657698088146,0.37374353601729265,0.10840805410589964,0.5688913108286958,0.17491077887954928,0.06745667185440431,0.12723931535163546
Building ecosystem resilience for climate change adaptation in the Asian highlands,"The Asian Highlands, the vast mountainous area from Pakistan to China including the Hindu-Kush Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, have considerable global importance; they are the source of most of the major rivers of Asia, which sustain billions of downstream dwellers, are part of four Global Biodiversity Hotspots, and support rich cultural diversity. However, climate warming in the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau has been greater than two times the global average, and regional climate appears to be shifting with potential to trigger large-scale ecosystem regime shifts (landscape traps'). A host of other driversurbanization/infrastructure development, land-use/agricultural practices, upstream/downstream water management and ongoing nation-state security conflictsinteract with climate signals to produce complex changes across ecological and social systems. In response, highlands people are evolving hybrid forms of adaptive capacity where bottom-up' behaviors are mixing with top-down' state and market policies. To increase ecosystem and livelihood resilience to future change, there is a need to link upstream and downstream conservation action with local climate adaptation. While the key problem is that institutional and government capacity for coordination is low, we present four general strategies to move forward: application of cross-sector coordinated planning, strategic integration of science-based conservation with developing local-level hybrid knowledge, recognition of the critical role of governance in support of change, and increased emphasis on environmental security. We discuss these strategies for each driver of change in the region. (C) 2014 The Authors.

"Forest management options for adaptation to climate change: a case study of tall, wet eucalypt forests in Victoria's Central Highlands region","Australia has a highly diverse and variable climate and its forests are well-adapted to climatic variation. However, human-induced changes in climate could exceed historical ranges of variability and have effects on forests well beyond the experience of forest managers. These conditions will require implementation of management practices appropriate to a changing climate but there has been little analysis of potential management options for Australian native forests. The paper analyses potential management options for the tall, wet eucalypt forests in Victoria's Central Highlands. This region has already experienced a strong drying and warming trend and a high incidence of severe bushfires over the last 15years. Future changes are likely to include rising CO2, increasing temperatures and an overall decrease and changing seasonal patterns in rainfall. This is likely to result in higher fire danger weather conditions, changes in phenology of flowering, seeding and germination and shifts in forest composition and productivity. A range of different management options were considered and analysed in terms of current practice, costs and implementation feasibility. Many management actions identified to support adaptation to climate change were assessed as currently being implemented as part of sustainable forest management arrangements. Options that are not generally currently implemented include developing gene management programs and off-site gene banks, ex-situ conservation and increasing cooperation in species management, increasing stand and regional species diversity, identification and deployment of more drought- or disturbance-tolerant species or genotypes, planning to reduce disease losses through monitoring and sanitation harvests, managing stand structure to reduce impacts on water availability and implementing silvicultural techniques to promote stand vigour, as practised elsewhere in Australia. The likelihood of more intense rainfall events will require changes to infrastructure, such as forest road design and construction specifications. Implementing adaptation will require new approaches to forest management, potentially involving significant human intervention, new ecological, environmental and social research, new modes of communication with the public, new policies and revised regulations and management prescriptions.",0.5,0.2880647099673571,0.28060039793849895,0.23654450441885722,0.04921115519472863,0.07218728098149421,0.039903117539996515
Understanding convergence and divergence in the framing of climate change responses: An analysis of two wine companies,"Adaptation is a highly malleable concept and people may use various framings of adaptation to support what they are already doing and limit their need to change. By analysing organizations' different, strategic constructions of climate change, this malleability becomes clear. Our paper focuses on two Australian wine companies' approaches to climate change. Using an analysis of interviews with 18 company staff we uncovered two divergent business logics underlying the same climate change responses. Our analysis extends beyond simply identifying dominant frames of climate change to examining what motivates different organizations to create different frames. This has implications for the climate change responses that organizations might implement (or not) and more broadly, for how climate change 'adaptation' (and 'mitigation') is understood and applied.

"Adaptive climate change resilient indigenous fisheries strategies in the floodplain wetlands of West Bengal, India","Floodplain wetlands are considered as biologically sensitive habitats and predicted to be the most impacted through climate change. They form an important fishery resource in West Bengal, India. Analysis of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) derived climatic data has revealed a unanimous warming trend (0.18-0.28 degrees C) and decreasing rainfall (135.6-257 mm) among the studied districts (North 24 Parganas, Nadia and Kolkata) of West Bengal over the last three decades. Four floodplain wetlands under cooperative fisheries management were studied during February 2015 and December 2015. Data were collected through a structured communication process involving multiple interviews through multiple rounds of surveys and also from secondary sources. Six climate smart fishery strategies could be identified, namely Temporary pre-summer enclosure, Submerged branch pile (Kata) refuge, Autumn stocking, Torch light fishing, Deep pool (Komor) refuge and Floating aquatic macrophyte refuge fishery (Pana chapa). Few of them are capable of serving as conservation tools by providing refuge during summer or water stress and maintaining base stocks in the wetlands for recruitment in the following monsoon season. The present paper discusses the climate smart nature of these pre-existing indigenous fishery strategies. These strategies need to be optimized and may be used for adoption of sustainable climate smart fisheries management in floodplain wetlands.",0.718198614103506,0.27707629378799026,0.11904941904165375,0.4711881182564376,0.11284365941128746,0.05983813398581603,0.08191250982256135
Impacts and effects of government regulation on farmers' responses to drought: A case study of North China Plain,"Frequent extreme weather events like drought, etc. in the context of climate change present huge challenges to agricultural production. To find out if farmers have taken measures against them and identify governments' impact on their response measures are the foundation of and key to further improving relevant policies and farmers' responsiveness. Taking the North China Plain as an example, the study analyzes farmers' responses to frequent climate change-induced drought, and assesses the impacts of governments' early-warning, policy support and other factors on farmers' responses based on questionnaire survey data and an econometric approach. The results show that: (1) Farmers are responsive to drought, and they are more likely to take measures as the degree of drought deepening. (2) Governments' regulation affects farmers' responses, although only part of its regulation measures has remarkable effects. Governments' early-warning messages can increase the possibility of farmers' responding to drought, however, only when they get the early-warning in all the processes including before, during, and after disasters can the effects be significant. Currently, as the primary channel through which early-warning information is released, television cannot change farmers' behaviors significantly. Early-warning is most effective when spread via two or more types of channels. In addition, governments' (especially town and village level institutions') policy support has certain impacts on farmers' responses to drought, yet with less prominent effects in disaster years than in normal years; to provide subsidies, as a regulation measure, can encourage farmers' initiative a lot in adopting response measures, but most of the farmers haven't got support from any institutions. Both the structure and strength of government regulation need to be improved. (3) Farmers with different conditions respond differently. Farmer households in irrigation areas, those whose farmland is lower fragmented, and those with numerous agricultural family members tend to take response measures. The study can provide scientific reference to the making of relevant regulation policies under the background of acidifications.",0.9457913835904067,0.20124757464632795,0.06391070364764506,0.3444908227464349,0.01095257615484999,0.02844931615308301,0.1017385236148526
Adaptation strategies followed by the livestock rearers of Coastal Odisha and West Bengal to cope up with climate change,"Adaptation to climate change and variability has recently become a subject of increasing importance in climate change research with an objective to reduce the vulnerability of climate sensitive people. The present study was designed to identify and assess the adaptation strategies followed by the climate sensitive livestock rearers of coastal Odisha and West Bengal. Livestock rearers (480) were selected from 4 coastal districts of Odisha and West Bengal. The study revealed that 17 adaptation strategies were followed by the livestock rearer. To trace the relative importance among the adaptation strategies, an exclusively climate change adaptation index was developed. It was observed that change in micro-climate in cattle shed/grazing area/stall was the most preferred adaptation strategy followed by providing the frequent clean and fresh drinking water and additional washing/sprinkling of cattle and buffaloes. Livestocks are very much susceptible to heat stress.

Sustainable irrigation: How did irrigated agriculture in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin adapt in the Millennium Drought?,"The recent drought in south-eastern Australia saw the lowest inflows on record in the Murray-Darling Basin in 2006. As reservoirs were drawn down water availability for irrigation was cut. In 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, irrigators received about one third of their pre-drought allocations. Understanding how the irrigation sector adapted to less water will help planning for the next drought and a future in which irrigation water use will be reduced permanently in the basin. The aggregate responses that we report are consistent with reported data on strategies used by irrigators to adapt to less water, including water trading, input substitution, changes to crop mix, and improvements to technology leading to reduced water application rates and yield increases. These responses likely also provide some insight on how irrigators will adapt to future more permanent reductions in irrigation water and assist in the identification of constraints to adaption.

Assessing the Potential of Indigenous Technological Knowledge (ITK) for Adaptation to Climate Change in the Himalayan and Arid ecosystems,"The present study was conducted with the objective of documenting and assessing the potential of indigenous knowledge towards adaptation to climate change covering a sample of 200 farmers, hundred each from Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan representing Himalayan and Arid ecosystems respectively. Documentation of ITK was done using both primary and secondary source of information. In-depth study was designed by combining survey and anthropological approach of participant study. The major documented indigenous knowledge was 'mind' cultivation, 'chal' to harvest water, 'apple paste' to control diseases and 'siddu' to protect from extreme cold in Himachal Pradesh. Similarly, the major documented indigenous knowledge of Rajasthan were-Khadin' farming system to manage drought, 'kanabandi' to manage soil and wind storm, 'tanka' to harvest water, 'jupka' and 'kothi' for storing the grain and feed, etc. Beside these, the people of both the ecosystems observed the movement of insects and animals (butterfly, ant, and termite) to forecast the rainfall and other climatic parameter.

Effects of climate change on household economy and adaptive responses among agricultural households in eastern coast of India,"It is imperative to understand the effects of climate change on household members and the vulnerability level in and across agricultural households for India in general, and for eastern coastal part of the country in particular. This study covers primary data from 150 households from 2 blocks of Kendrapara district in Odisha. The household level unit of analysis is policy driven and follows the IPCC model on Vulnerability Analysis and Climate Change Adaptation Research. The model is expanded to include the livelihood strategies of the households, in order to empirically assess their vulnerability and adaptive responses.

Managing multi-purpose leisure facilities in a time of climate change,"In this paper, we examine the ways in which multi-purpose leisure facilities (MPLFs) - being pivotal places for delivering aquatic, exercise, and indoor sport programmes - have responded to the climate change problem. The study was framed by a resource-based view of organisations which theorises that the capacity for effective responses will be dependent upon the breadth and quality of the resources available for strategy formulation and implementation. Using an intensive case study methodology, two distinct MPLFs in Melbourne, Australia, were targeted for the analysis. It was found that while the managers of each facility were aware of the climate change problem, the preparedness to initiate change in response to shifting weather patterns - either through mitigation or adaptation - was more pronounced for the facility that had a strong base of 'environmental knowledge resources'. Additionally, these resources were used to pursue mainly adaptation strategies that included more efficient electric power use and frugal water use. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",0.40731608705169703,0.3330797191635148,0.13081095108595983,0.35813521965620243,0.10975151422900131,0.09263479859149719,0.08851926187546912
Multipurpose agroforestry as a climate change resiliency option for farmers: an example of local adaptation in Vietnam,"Increasing frequency, intensity and duration of severe weather events are posing major challenges to global food security and livelihoods of rural people. Agriculture has evolved through adaptation to local circumstances for thousands of years. Local experience in responding to severe weather conditions, accumulated over generations and centuries, is valuable for developing adaptation options to current climate change. This study aimed to: (i) identify tree species that reduce vulnerability of cropping systems under climate variability; and (ii) develop a method for rapidly assessing vulnerability and exploring strategies of smallholder farmers in rural areas exposed to climate variability. Participatory Rural Appraisal methods in combination with Geographical Information Systems tools and statistical analysis of meteorological data were used to evaluate local vulnerability to climate change and to investigate local adaptation measures in two selected villages in Vietnam, one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. The low predictability of severe weather events makes food crops, especially grain production, insecure. This study shows that while rice and rain- fed crops suffered over 40 % yield losses in years of extreme drought or flood, tree- based systems and cattle were less affected. 13 tree species performed well under the harsh local climate conditions in home and forest gardens to provide income, food, feed and other environmental benefits. Thus, this research suggests that maintenance and enhancement of locally evolved agroforestry systems, with high resilience and multiple benefits, can contribute to climate change adaptation.",0.9252714485179688,0.2533687175614516,0.11526481385434487,0.4667385356754596,0.03408086354569871,0.039248548130121255,0.07461767600523089
The interrelationship between travel behavior and life choices in adapting to flood disasters,"Disasters resulting from climate change are shown to be important determinants of people's life choice decisions. In the literature, travel behavior choice and life choices are usually addressed separately under disasters such as flood and cyclone. However, travel behavior may be interdependent with other life choices, jointly shaping people's adaptation decisions. To this end, the paper advances the literature by exploring the interrelationship between changes in travel behavior and job and residential location under flood disasters, while separating coastal and inland observations. For this purpose, a stated preference survey was conducted in 14 cities of Bangladesh in early 2013. An analysis approach based on structural equation modeling was developed to investigate the correlations between travel behavior change and job and residential location changes. Model estimation results suggest that flood impacts have significant influences on inland people's life choices, while coastal people's life choices are mainly affected by flood adaptation responses and attitudes. Significant correlations between travel behavior change and job and residential location changes are found for both observations. Moreover, both coastal and inland people tend not to change residential locations if changes in job location and travel behavior are made. Inland people may not change travel behavior if their job and/or residential locations are changed, but coastal people's job and residential location changes are associated with changes in travel behavior. Travel behavior change is found to have more of an effect on residential location change than job location change in both regions. These findings conclude that the two-way relationship between travel behavior and life choices should be taken into account in future analyses, and thus adaptation policies to climate change disasters could be better linked with people's behavioral responses.",0.23397632578229927,0.36529106521944904,0.12264649064629371,0.31166543043332245,0.12821267377456577,0.20508105050273026,0.12634190812330995

Coping with coastal risk and vulnerabilities in Bangladesh,"Livelihoods in the coastal zone are vulnerable to a variety of shocks (e.g. cyclone), trends (e.g. climate change) and seasonality (e.g. salinity). This is probably due to economic and social susceptibility. In a developing economy, vulnerability is also studied in terms of the power aspects of gender (the inequality in power relations between men and women), and manifested in the marginalization of (mostly) women in social, economic, political and cultural spheres of life. However, gender related vulnerability to disasters is a socially created form of vulnerability. This paper focuses on understanding gender-differentiated impacts on different livelihoods and how they affect the formulation of policies, programs or projects. It also examines how this input into program formulation reduces the level of risk faced by poor people and enhances their resilience and ability to cope with stresses. The results show that some coping mechanisms are directly enacted at the individual or household level (limits on food consumption, sale of assets, and so forth) and some are enacted at the livelihood group level, where people devise their coping strategies on a more occupational and livelihood-based domain. People enact these strategies in a group manner and react according to their basic needs and the requirements of their livelihoods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate change and small-scale agriculture in the Ecuadorian Andes: a study on local perceptions and adaptation strategies,"The tropical Andes have been declared one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate change. Processes of glacial decline, including their altogether disappearance, as well as notable changes in rainfall patterns presently affect the region. This research took place in two distinct ecological zones of the northern highlands of Ecuador: premontaine dry forest and montaine wet forest. The authors collected and analyzed data on perceptions of men and women small-scale farmers with regard to the experiences with changes in climate variables. Subsequently, findings were contrasted with available official weather change data. In addition, the authors studied perceptions with regard to perceived causes of climate change and the level of risk, and the research explored different individual and collective coping and adaptation measures. The research identified that perceptions of climate change variables concurred with available meteorological data. Nevertheless, farmers from both zones had great difficulty predicting climate change and thought that they must not only be prepared to react to adverse events. The research also underlines local organizational capacity, necessary for the construction of adaptive strategies. In this work we manifest the importance of understanding local context with the end of designing intervention programs of small-scale agriculture in the Ecuadorian Andes.",0.7566455221633521,0.2894875709254753,0.12111148870430595,0.44159741964439275,0.04200177901700521,0.037229356803470566,0.09254230981636594
Climate Change Coping Strategy Expressed in the Federal Public Policies in Brazil,"The objective of this paper is to analyze the climate change coping strategy in Brazil expressed in the federal government policy up to 2012, seeking to identify the implicit concept of development in light of the overall goal of sustainability. Besides the National Policy on Climate Change (NPCC), the development plans of the following sectors were also analyzed: combat to deforestation, energy, agriculture and transport. The methodology was based on content analysis of the official documents, which was supported by literature review and information obtained in interviews with qualified informants. The results showed that the NPCC favors mitigation actions over those directed to adaptation. The contradictions of this strategy become apparent in areas such as the sub-salt exploration, investment in large-scale farming, and no consideration of social inequality. The conclusion indicates that the consideration of climate change issues by the government is secondary, being the main objective to promote a development model anchored on economic growth.",0.4744409832381703,0.28254811443906713,0.12358821750972124,0.373352307014341,0.08691288376562586,0.08130514150226066,0.08485204364315273
Rural families' interpretations of experiencing unexpected transition in the wake of a natural disaster,"Natural disasters affect populations in various parts of the world. The impacts of disasters can cause many problems to the health of people and disruption to family life, potentially leading to an unexpected transition. The objective of this paper is to present the unexpected transitional experiences of rural families following a natural disaster. A multiple case study of six families was conducted with children and adolescents in a rural area affected by a 2008 disaster in southern Brazil. For data collection, we used participant observation, narrative interviews, genograms, ecomaps and an instrument called calendar routine. The analysis of the data resulted in different family interpretations about the changes resulting from the storm and compared life before and after the disaster. The loss of homes and loved ones, migration, unemployment, and losses from the farm were the main changes associated with new development tasks. The experiences of family transition after the disaster revealed that losses influenced social lives, daily routines and the preservation of cultural values.",0.3097763067634476,0.4865359320447612,0.09541289904865966,0.4572120101501631,0.1316646893567207,0.08529674945596806,0.12652114712959997
Social learning as an adaptive measure to prepare for climate change impacts on water provision in Peru,"This article examines the conditions under which social learning occurs and leads to adaptive measures through two empirical examples of Peruvian cities that invested in watershed protection for their urban water supplies. Social learning is an increasingly popular approach aimed at achieving socio-ecological resiliency through multi-stakeholder collaborative governance processes. Social learning is a convergence in knowledge that occurs through dialog and deliberation. Yet, assumptions that social learning will necessarily lead to more environmentally sustainable and resilient practices may be overly optimistic, especially as they rarely consider the political and organizational dimensions of decision making. This study analyzes two seemingly similar case studies of multi-stakeholder water management in Peru that resulted in watershed protection programs—a novelty in Peru that will help ensure future water supplies. Despite similar programs adopted, though, the social interactions were markedly different. Social learning occurred in Moyobamba, where the multi-stakeholder platform was characterized by trust, flexibility, and sustainability. In Cusco, however, stakeholders reached an agreement on projects for watershed protection, but the process exhibited little evidence of social learning, trust, or flexibility. In this article, I use process tracing to analyze if and how social learning occurred in each case. Then, I identify factors that contributed to social learning, including diverse participation, open communication, multiple sources of knowledge, extended engagement, unbiased facilitation, and an opportunity to influence outcomes. © 2017, AESS.",0.2584017277765035,0.43658990631331596,0.1634565184457945,0.3345711768334852,0.11918150414540216,0.16532267065753947,0.27465099588717534
Assessing adaptation - Climate change and indigenous livelihood in the Andes of Bolivia,"Based on a case study of Charazani - Bolivia, this article outlines the understanding of adaptive strategies to cope with climate change and its impact on environmental and socioeconomic conditions that are affecting rural livelihoods. Mainly qualitative methods were used to collect and analyze data following the framework for vulnerability assessments of a socio-ecological system. Climate data reveals an increase of precipitation and temperature during the last decades. Furthermore the occurrence of extreme weather events, particularly drought, frost, hailstorms and consequently landslides and fire are increasing. Local testimonies highlight these events as the principle reasons for agricultural losses. This climatic variability and simultaneous social changes were identified as the drivers of vulnerability. Yet, several adaptive measures were identified at household, community and external levels in order to cope with such vulnerability; e.g. traditional techniques in agriculture and risk management. Gradually, farmers complement these activities with contemporary practices in agriculture, like intensification of land use, diversification of irrigation system and use of artificial fertilizers. As part of a recent trend community members are forced to search for new off-farm alternatives beyond agriculture for subsistence. Despite there is a correspondingly large array of possible adaptation measures that families are implementing, local testimonies point out, that farmers often do not have the capacity and neither the economical resources to mitigate the risk in agricultural production. Although several actions are already considered to promote further adaptive capacity, the current target is to improve existing livelihood strategies by reducing vulnerability to hazards induced by climate change.",0.9065057670074187,0.30690684145660835,0.14674116602962575,0.4403998611835229,0.06608664450245552,0.04993854634543413,0.1287756017175937
"Farm Resilience in Organic and Nonorganic Cocoa Farming Systems in Alto Beni, Bolivia","Cocoa production in Alto Beni, Bolivia, is a major source of income and is severely affected by climate change impacts and other stress factors. Resilient farming systems are, thus, important for local families. This study compares indicators for social-ecological resilience in 30 organic and 22 nonorganic cocoa farms of Alto Beni. Organic farms had a higher tree and crop diversity, higher yields and incomes, more social connectedness, and participated in more courses on cocoa cultivation. Resilience was enhanced by local farmers' organizations, providing organic certification and supporting diversified agroforestry with seedlings and extension, going beyond basic organic certification requirements.",0.9052218736631724,0.261571641814922,0.10674323584361758,0.4411202989608987,0.03779793822734267,0.036465608575601036,0.050625192397181676
Why popular support tools on climate change adaptation have difficulties in reaching local policy-makers: Qualitative insights from the UK and Germany,"Policy support for climate change adaptation has grown rapidly and respective tools (such as online guides and handbooks) have been documented and categorized repeatedly in recent years. Nevertheless, we still know little about how relevant their target groups find them for their work. We aim to address this gap with case studies on two well-known support tools: the Adaptation Wizard from the UK and the Klimalotse from Germany. After showing how adaptation support tools have spread in recent years, we analyze qualitatively how relevant regional and local policy-makers concerned with adaptation find the two tools. One of our main findings is the following discrepancy: while both tools offer support in developing and implementing comprehensive adaptation plans, local policy-makers find this irrelevant and expect support in coping with imminent climate change impacts, for example, by single adaptation measures. Consequently, the local policy-makers we interviewed hardly use the two tools but seek more specific support, in particular regarding vulnerability and cost-benefit assessments. We conclude that policy support tools lack relevance when their well-intended attempt to enlighten target groups is too remote from what the latter expect.",0.2771389160056121,0.3706453580522029,0.13980781447343862,0.3031572809880533,0.08565766492985019,0.1804234218380342,0.1357387261642839
Prepared and flexible: Local adaptation strategies for avalanche risk,"Living with avalanche risk and road closures is part of everyday life for many communities in avalanche prone areas. This paper illustrates the interplay and dynamics of adaptive capacity and social capital through locally developed adaptation strategies to avalanche risk in two case areas in Northern Norway. Social capital includes empirically derived categories that are often connected to adaptation research: social networks and trust, place attachment, local and experiential knowledge, engaged individuals and perception of risk. These play a significant role in activating adaptive capacity, which results in adaptation strategies. The paper illustrates how adaptive capacity and resulting adaptation are outcomes of interacting, rather than individual, attributes of social capital. The adaptation strategies align in three broad categories: preparedness, flexible arrangements and influencing decision-makers. The paper shows that the communities demonstrate high adaptive capacity to deal with risk and that social capital plays a role in ensuring and shaping such capacity. However, there are significant costs associated with adaptation strategies aimed at sustaining the functions of everyday life and critical services. Such costs are relatively similar in the case areas and include limited mobility and participation in social activities, economic losses and the potential for failure to deliver health services, but they manifest in different degrees in each case study. The paper underlines the importance of the local context, which is critical for understanding both the impacts of natural hazards, such as avalanche and the socio-political contexts, which may either enable or hinder activation of adaptive capacity and adaptation strategies.",0.34822803500313143,0.46851340742205366,0.13218012491723793,0.43688826098713784,0.214013265976555,0.16451447207155792,0.3155983508569682
Adaptation to climate change at local level in Europe: An overview,"Europe's climate change vulnerability pushes for initiatives such as the European Adaptation Strategy and the associated Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. What are the triggers and barriers, for which sectors and for which risks and how is adaptation funded? This paper examines 147 Local Adaptation Strategies in Europe. Key triggers were incentives via research projects, implementation of EU policies and the increasing frequency of extreme climate events. Insufficient resources, capacity, political commitment and uncertainty were the main barriers. Prioritized sectors reflected the main local vulnerabilities - flood protection and water management, built environment and urban planning. Differing patterns of adaptation planning and adaptive capacity were identified among different regions in Europe. Large municipalities generally fund adaptation locally, whereas international and national funding appears to be more important for adaptation in less urban or densely populated territories. The database of LAS described in the present study can be expanded and used to increase the understanding of and promotion of local adaptation action in Europe and beyond.",0.27411285395658197,0.35331663920615547,0.1353536831754368,0.22908264126103717,0.12051713659359077,0.32844017344533205,0.2908676250526985
Adapting flood management to climate change: comparing policy frames and governance practices in the Low Countries,"Belgium and the Netherlands together form the Low Countries. Empirical research in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) and the Netherlands proves that there are substantive differences in the organization of governance processes regarding flood management in response to climate change. This article answers the question of how Flanders and the Netherlands, confronted with universal challenges and dilemmas in the governance of adaptation to climate change - integration versus differentiation (multi-sector versus sector-based governance), the problem of scaling (multilevel governance) and the division of public and private responsibilities (multi-actor governance) - are designing and structuring their approaches. More specifically, we look at how differences in the framing of climate adaptation can explain why organizational practices differ. For this purpose, a distinction is made between diagnostic framing (what is the problem?), prognostic framing (what could be possible solutions?) and action framing (how to act?). By referring to existing policy frames, the article explains recent policy choices on climate change adaptation in flood management.",0.1465188329321218,0.3736529213817689,0.17607779976993077,0.215727673007101,0.17647133676437657,0.5569576322177255,0.2844191674654673
Sun protective behaviour of vacationers spending holidays in the tropics and subtropics.,"BACKGROUND: The development of malignant melanoma has been associated with intense episodic sun exposure, as it typically occurs during holidays in high ultraviolet (UV)-index countries.; OBJECTIVES: To investigate sun protective behaviour and sunburn experience of vacationers spending holidays in the tropics or subtropics.; METHODS: Using standardized face-to-face interviews, we conducted cross-sectional surveys among air passengers waiting in the departure or the baggage claim area at the Airport Basel-Mulhouse (Switzerland/France), and among vacationers waiting for pretravel health advice at a travel clinic in Basel (Switzerland).; RESULTS: We completed 533, 324 and 308 interviews with departing air passengers, returning air passengers and vacationers at the travel clinic, respectively. The interviews revealed widespread misconceptions about how to prepare the skin for the sun before holidays (e.g. pretanning in the solarium). At the holiday destination, almost all respondents used sunscreen, whereas wearing protective clothing and seeking shade were less practised. Among the returning air passengers, 44% had got sunburnt during their holiday stay.; CONCLUSIONS: The sunburn rate among returning vacationers was alarmingly high. Skin cancer prevention campaigns and pretravel health advice should tackle misconceptions regarding the preparation of the skin for the sun, and emphasize the significance of covering up and seeking shade. © 2014 British Association of Dermatologists.",0.2795706590928911,0.39651326791768127,0.08756403032445456,0.24653284517063145,0.06979238518791685,0.15610861234920032,0.07342565381877084
Resilient flood risk strategies: institutional preconditions for implementation,"There is a growing recognition of resilience enhancement as an additional objective for adaptation. This will typically involve enhancing the preparedness and capacity to respond to the impacts of climate change. Within flood risk practice, resilient strategies focus on reducing impacts from flooding through better prevention and preparedness. Such strategies will not only reduce existing risk levels, but could also make the social-ecological system more robust for extreme flood events. This is because they seek to prevent those impacts on the system from which recovery is extremely difficult without outside help. Besides that, resilient strategies increase the prospect for the realization of cobenefits, particularly when measures are selected within the spatial domain. Implementing resilient strategies, however, faces many difficulties, particularly in countries like the Netherlands and Poland where prevalent governance arrangements are aimed to facilitate resistant strategies, focusing exclusively on flood protection. We analyzed these implementation difficulties for the Island of Dordrecht, which is a front-runner case of resilient flood risk governance in the Netherlands. A theoretical framework based on relevant issues regarding governance arrangements was used to reflect on the identified gaps and barriers. Although all issues played a role in the case study, there seem to be no generic institutional design parameters that have to be applied for implementing resilient strategies. Even in the current institutional regime, it is possible to find ways of implementing a resilient strategy. The more general institutional precondition has to do with the political willingness to allow for collaboration and experimentation and to enable a more flexible use of current principles and rules.",0.19430215709864423,0.3756860785427693,0.14834698194559076,0.28535489552057614,0.1799227892513145,0.4645019112488991,0.42044106434845663
Strategic planning for climate change mitigation and adaptation: the case of Greece,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to put forward a methodological framework to provide a comparative assessment of available mitigation and adaptation strategies against climate change. Mitigation options aim at minimizing CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, in an effort to reduce the rate of increase in global temperature. On the other hand, adaptation options relate to the ability of the natural or human systems to handle the impact of the climate change and to adjust to its effects, seeking to eliminate the adverse consequences and take advantage of any beneficial outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology focuses on specific parameters, leading to the most efficient package of alternatives for the area of Greece. The selection of the ""optimal"" ranking of alternatives in a defined strategy is a sophisticated procedure, and a multi-criteria decision-making process was established. A questionnaire was designed and used as input to the overall framework, based on specific decision criteria. Climate change experts gave their feedback via a face-to-face interview. ELECTRE III multi-criteria decision analysis was adopted for the comparative evaluation, as it fits best to complex environmental problems. An ""optimal"" sequence of mitigation and adaptation strategies was provided for Greece. Findings - The use of renewable energy sources, increase of energy efficiency and improved forest management - tree planting and rational water management - are among the most promising options to strategically plan climate change mitigation and adaptation for Greece. Originality/value - The presented study provides an insight into alternative mitigation and adaptation strategies against climate change. The use of the multi-criteria analysis is an innovative approach to outline the optimal bundle of strategies. The methodology focuses on specific parameters, leading to the most efficient package of measures for the area of Greece. Such an approach is implemented for the first time in Greece, at least up to the authors' knowledge, and provides a basis for strategic governance and policy modeling for the area under consideration.",0.3619954640570429,0.2788106581819459,0.11114837692751085,0.25360630012247687,0.040470812299597356,0.20738897132585293,0.07439674821485698
Resilience in Mountain Farming in Norway,"The concept of socio-ecological farm resilience is used to understand how farmers manoeuvre in a context of change, what choices and priorities they make, and how that subsequently influences the development of the farming landscape. The author uses farm resilience, the capabilities of buffering, adaptation and transformation, and the response of bouncing back or forward as a conceptual frame in a study of farmers in a mountain community in Norway. Interviews were held with selected farmers. The results indicated that the resilience framework is useful in order to understand farmers' priorities and situations. The author finds that the responses and decisions are in line with all three capabilities as well as with bouncing back and forward. However, most responses were categorized as bouncing back (i.e. adjustments and changes) but the logic of the farm system remained the same.",0.8554894725272739,0.26663447192410233,0.12247776735974657,0.4637541844508645,0.045416676143985604,0.028472361395081625,0.10629018456114464
Community-based adaptation to climate change in Schleswig-Holstein: Challenges and opportunities,"Communities will play a key role in climate adaptation as dealing with future impacts of climate change will require solutions tailored at the local level. Significant impacts of climate change in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein include rising temperatures, changes in the precipitation regime and long-term sea-level rise. These present both challenges and opportunities for communities in Schleswig-Holstein. Many of those communities are currently starting to formulate adaptation strategies. Planning and implementation of specific adaptation measures and activities are likely to follow the development of adaptation strategies. Communities in the northern federal state will increasingly need to institutionalize climate adaptation and treat it as an integrated management task. This can meet other strategic objectives and lead to sustainable planning. Due to uncertainty about the consequences of climate change, we recommend that communities develop robust and flexible adaptation plans, for example, with no-regret measures. If adaptation capacities are limited, communities will also need to think about transformational adaptation. © 2019, Deutscher Verband für Angewandte Geographie (DVAG).",0.1681916821615231,0.3870502299937809,0.12186351630532664,0.2733990235881761,0.16237676379156424,0.26216255686716555,0.11416476771186515

"""Are you prepared?' Representations and management of floods in Lomanikoro, Rewa (Fiji)","The islands of Fiji, in the Western Pacific, are exposed to a wide range of natural hazards. Tropical storms and associated floods are recurring natural phenomena, but it has been regularly alleged that Fijians lack preparation, over-rely on state assistance in post-disaster situations or engage in risky behaviours that aggravate the negative impact of floods. Risk reduction strategies, which are now implemented by government authorities and international organisations, heavily promote the principle of community preparedness'. Both community awareness programmes and capacity-building programmes are conducted throughout the country in the most vulnerable communities. This paper analyses how the inhabitants of Lomanikoro village, in the low areas of the Rewa Delta, perceive and manage existing flood risks. It examines social and cultural factors that contribute to shape risk response locallyin particular, why villagers may be reluctant to adopt some recommended preparedness measures and resettle in higher, safer zones.",0.19545710545777062,0.42082169430495003,0.13613858174836094,0.35264642077029773,0.21453599686056,0.3354957927981474,0.25367591883005847
Coping with extreme weather: communities in Fiji and Vanuatu share their experiences and knowledge,"Local communities across the Pacific Island region have long prepared for and managed extreme weather events. Strategies to cope with extreme weather, particularly cyclones and droughts, have involved using particular planting techniques, initiating innovative water storage practices, and employing food preservation tactics to survive. These local experiences and knowledge have been passed on between generations through stories and sharing practical know-how; however, very little formal documentation has transpired to date. This research attempts to document and synthesis these experiences and knowledge to safeguard them through written accounts but also demonstrate how Pacific communities can provide valuable, appropriate and effective strategies to prepare for and respond to extreme weather events. In-depth interviews (n = 40) were conducted with community members from three villages in Fiji (Naselesele, Qeleni and Yanuca) and three villages in Vanuatu (Piliura, Tassiriki and Lonamilo). While typically missing from community vulnerability and risk assessments in the Pacific, local experiences and knowledge are a core strength in enhancing adaptive capacity and planning community-based activities.",0.41656063545376776,0.4101058917725615,0.10868684953622708,0.4017142081550428,0.13031804631487076,0.06480130595430239,0.26197666830070737
The Role of Indigenous and Traditional Knowledge in Ecosystem-Based Adaptation: A Review of the Literature and Case Studies from the Pacific Islands,"Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) is increasingly being advocated as a climate adaptation approach that can deliver multiple benefits to communities. EbA scholarship argues that community-based projects can strengthen those ecosystems that deliver critical services to communities and in doing so enhance community resilience. In particular, the inclusion of indigenous and traditional knowledge (ITK) into community-based EbA projects is positioned as critical to successful climate adaptation. Yet, there is surprisingly little investigation into how ITK is being defined and incorporated into EbA initiatives. This paper critically reviews EbA literature and provides empirical examples from Vanuatu and Samoa to demonstrate the different ways ITK relates to EbA projects. We find that there is widespread recognition that ITK is important for indigenous and local communities and can be employed successfully in EbA. However, this recognition is more aspirational than practical and is not being necessarily translated into ITK-informed or ITK-driven EbA projects. ITK should not be conceptualized simply as a collection of local environmental information that is integrated with Western scientific knowledge. Instead, ITK is part of nested knowledge systems (information-practices-worldviews) of indigenous peoples. This knowledge includes local natural resource management, sociocultural governance structures, social norms, spiritual beliefs, and historical and contemporary experiences of colonial dispossession and marginalization. At present, most EbA projects focus on the provision of information to main decision-makers only; however, since ITK is held collectively, it is essential that entire communities are included in ITK EbA projects. There is a huge potential for researchers and ITK holders to coproduce knowledge that would be best placed to drive climate adaptation in a changing world.",0.2681340320917241,0.4798081814478359,0.21594735098661805,0.35875836696460356,0.16769370211654014,0.10902140575976337,0.23100861888408203
Climate-induced migration: Exploring local perspectives in Kiribati,"A number of studies have indicated that the long term habitability of Kiribati, a low-lying country in the central tropical Pacific Ocean, is tenuous given the impacts of climate change, particularly sea level rise. In an effort to plan for the resultant challenges ahead, a number of national policies and programs have surfaced to reduce the impact of localized changes on people's livelihoods. This study explores how local community members (n=60) have taken it upon themselves to respond to the impacts of climate change by utilizing a number of different strategies. The results highlight that: first, respondents consider climate change to be the most concerning issue for sustaining their livelihoods; second, respondents have built physical defences, relocated temporarily or permanently, and sought government assistance to adapt to localized climate-related impacts; and third, the majority of respondents indicated that they would migrate as a long term strategy to respond to the future impacts of climate change.",0.44802212433524713,0.3996371750525366,0.14963086744240012,0.4040059325157905,0.13267803911104237,0.08151792387583992,0.16647154155570718
The impacts of weather on tourist travel,"Interest in the interactions between climate, weather and tourism has increased markedly in the last decade in response to climate change concerns; however, there is little empirical research on how tourists respond to the weather conditions they encounter. Thus, in this paper, we examine the impact of the weather on a sample of international tourists visiting New Zealand during the 2009-10 summer season. Based on weather-related changes made to tourists' travel routes, the timing of their travel and activity participation while in New Zealand, respondents were segmented into three groups: those with no travel changes' during their trip, those with some travel changes' and those with substantial travel changes' to their trip. The results show a generally high level of changes made to trips, particularly in the less settled early summer season, and an interesting link with satisfaction. The research provides an empirical basis for a framework that would facilitate further research into the adaptive capacity of tourists towards climate variability and change.",0.3935070458113411,0.34982538621738507,0.09723424348153797,0.27442614903751994,0.07780540164567507,0.08511676472890231,0.06128994561109803
Climate change and world heritage: a cross-border analysis of the Sundarbans (Bangladesh-India),"The national policy context influences micro-level management actions for natural World Heritage facing the challenge of climate change in the developing world. Little is currently known about how climate vulnerable natural World Heritage is managed to build resilience within the socio-ecological system. Management actions based on conservation, biodiversity, community and tourism policies are important determinants of socio-ecological resilience. The aim of this study is to present a critical cross-border comparative analysis of climate change management responses for building resilience in the Bangladesh and Indian Sundarbans World Heritage area. Drawing on semi-structured stakeholder interviews and document analysis, this research finds that along with the modification of conventional biodiversity conservation practices, management agencies address community needs such as adaptation, livelihoods, involvement and empowerment to build resilience by minimising community-induced forest depletion. The management regimes of the Sunderbans in Bangladesh and India have relative advantages in biodiversity conservation in response to climate change. This research also finds that biodiversity conservation actions are challenged by poor enforcement systems, destructive land use policy, and uncontrolled economic activities including tourism which may threaten the socio-ecological resilience of the World Heritage area.",0.38265322099732674,0.3515604121588315,0.27396661286477797,0.4475558797843501,0.09481286897460976,0.05073650346532593,0.0777452143421409
Learning to Manage and Managing to Learn: Sustaining Freshwater Recreational Fisheries in a Changing Environment,"Freshwaters are being transformed by multiple environmental drivers, creating uncertainty about future conditions. One way of coping with uncertainty is to manage for resilience to unanticipated events while facilitating learning through adaptive management. We outline the application of these strategies to freshwater recreational fisheries management using a case study in Wisconsin, USA, where black bass (Micropterus spp.) populations are increasing, while Walleye (Sander vitreus) populations are decreasing. Managing for heterogeneity in functional groups (e.g., age classes and prey species of sport fishes), fishery objectives, and regulations can increase resilience, although heterogeneity must be balanced with replication to facilitate learning. Monitoring designed to evaluate management objectives and inform about critical uncertainties, when combined with heterogeneity, creates opportunities for adaptive management, another critical resilience strategy. Although barriers exist to implementing resilience strategies, management designed to accommodate uncertainty and illuminate its consequences is needed to maintain critical fisheries in a rapidly changing world. Los cuerpos de agua dulce estan siendo transformados por multiples factores ambientales, lo que genera incertidumbre sobre lo que sucedera en el futuro. Una forma de enfrentar esta incertidumbre es el manejo de la resiliencia con respeto a eventos no anticipados y, simultaneamente, facilitar el aprendizaje a traves del manejo adaptativo. En este trabajo se muestra la aplicacion de estas estrategias en el manejo de pesquerias recreativas de agua dulce tomando un caso de estudio en Wisconsin, en el que las poblaciones de la lobina negra (Micropterus spp.) estan incrementandose, en tanto que las de la lucioperca americana (Sander vitreus) estan disminuyendo. El manejo enfocado en la heterogeneidad de grupos funcionales (p.e., ciertas clases de edad y presas de peces de pesca deportiva), en los objetivos y en las regulaciones de la pesqueria pueden aumentar la resiliencia, no obstante atender la heterogeneidad debe equilibrarse usando replicas que faciliten el aprendizaje. El monitoreo disenado para evaluar los objetivos del manejo e informar acerca de imprecisiones importantes que, al combinarse con la heterogeneidad, generan oportunidades para el manejo adaptativo, representa otra estrategia critica para incrementar la resiliencia. Aunque existen obstaculos para implementar las estrategias enfocadas en la resiliencia, se necesita un manejo que incorpore la incertidumbre y que advierta sobre sus consecuencias, con el fin de mantener vivas importantes pesquerias en un mundo que esta en constante cambio.",0.3793133011368583,0.32854834175631636,0.26296249814197525,0.3806384097188418,0.07342786546684398,0.06095386480634736,0.09835559369174457
Forest-fire protection infrastructures in natural protected areas with management bodies in Greece,"The recent global climate change has already increased the risk of fire in Mediterranean forests, including protected natural areas. The adaptation options for fire protection that are related to forest fires and to climate change contain measures, which are relative to the management of biomass, the prevention and fighting of fires with proper infrastructure and, above all, with public sensitization. This research endeavours to examine the current situation of the above measures and to evaluate the 28 Management Bodies (M.B.) that are responsible for the corresponding 28 protected areas of Greece. As a research tool, the questionnaire method was used, in order to record and to evaluate the views of the land-use managers and scientists in each of the 28 Protected Areas (P.A.). The survey reveals differences among the various national parks with regard to fire-protection measures, as well as to the effectiveness of fire-fighting and public commitment, which were estimated to be more important than the management of fuel biomass. The results were evaluated in the light of a critical review of measures used in preventing and managing fires.",0.3965574271692349,0.3121185876546513,0.18611044366983925,0.27021421013361213,0.07253914553180113,0.14488849542958496,0.12841606867377287
Adaptation action and research in glaciated mountain systems: Are they enough to meet the challenge of climate change?,"The challenge of climate change in glaciated mountain systems is significant and cannot be met without adaptation actions and research that addresses the interwoven scientific, human, and socio-ecological dimensions of climate change. However, our understanding of the effectiveness of existing efforts in meeting this challenge is lacking, a shortcoming compounded by a lack of consistent and comparable information about adaptation action and research in glaciated mountain systems. This study develops a typology of the challenge of climate change in glaciated mountain systems and uses formal systematic review methods to critically evaluate existing adaptation actions and research in light of this framework. Our results-based on an evaluation of 170 English-language peer-reviewed and grey literature documents-indicate that socially-relevant climate-related changes are already manifesting in glaciated mountain systems, with the most commonly documented stimuli for adaptation being hydrological changes related to the degradation of the high mountain cryosphere. Some degree of adaptation action has occurred in 78% of countries with glaciated mountain ranges, but most adaptations are reactions to experienced climatic stimuli and carried out without guidance from a formal adaptation plan. The study also identified the emergence of explicitly mountain-focused adaptation research, yet studies framed in this way are still relatively scarce and have only been carried out in about half of the countries with glaciated mountain ranges. Although we document several laudable adaptation action and research efforts, few initiatives are adequately addressing the difficulties outlined in our evaluation framework for the challenge of climate change. The study discusses the consequences of observed shortcomings and identifies recommendations for more fully meeting the challenge of climate change in glaciated mountain systems.",0.460996088524453,0.3551985322022603,0.17117485059061985,0.32115615860849844,0.07913406166057596,0.15966076684736644,0.12173118355825405
ADAPTING INLAND FISHERIES MANAGEMENT TO A CHANGING CLIMATE,"Natural resource decision makers are challenged to adapt management to a changing climate while balancing short-term management goals with long-term changes in aquatic systems. Adaptation will require developing resilient ecosystems and resilient management systems. Decision makers already have tools to develop or ensure resilient aquatic systems and fisheries such as managing harvest and riparian zones. Because fisheries management often interacts with multiple stakeholders, adaptation strategies involving fisheries managers and other partners focused on land use, policy, and human systems, coupled with long-term monitoring, are necessary for resilient systems. We show how agencies and organizations are adapting to a changing climate in Minnesota and Ontario lakes and Montana streams. We also present how the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission created a management structure to develop adaptation strategies. These examples demonstrate how organizations and agencies can cope with climate change effects on fishes and fisheries through creating resilient management and ecological systems.",0.6459265962598729,0.3197742617737624,0.28742234595108285,0.37450379855448224,0.09681235512698219,0.05311434473883738,0.08049864633540625
Translating resilience-based management theory to practice for coral bleaching recovery in Hawai'i,"More frequent and severe coral bleaching events are prompting managers to seek practical interventions to promote ecosystem resilience. Although resilience-based management is now well established theoretically, there have been few examples of implementation. In Hawai'i, back-to-back bleaching events in 2014 and 2015 caused significant damage motivating the state to seek guidance on next steps for recovery. Hawai'i is a unique case study in distilling global recommendations to place-based action because of its ecological and social diversity. This study conducted a systematic review of literature using a weighted point system to evaluate and rank twelve potential Hawai'i-specific interventions to promote coral recovery following a bleaching event. Papers were scored based on their ability to achieve their management objective as well as their ability to directly affect coral recovery. A total of 100 papers were included in the review which varied in their scale (multi-site or case study), location (inside or outside of Hawah), and type of data collected (theoretical or empirical). Establishing a network of herbivore management areas ranked the highest followed by parrotfish size limits for action that could promote recovery in Hawai'i. Establishing a network of no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) was the intervention with the most literature and ranked third. This method provided a systematic way to compare the effectiveness of management interventions, a system that could be adapted to other regions. This type of evidence-based approach can lead to more fair and transparent decision-making processes, assisting reef managers in navigating the translation of resilience-based management from theory to practice.",0.33710728541561696,0.35501460535783486,0.1556419154426413,0.24986694136529813,0.11052835089560333,0.137996069076927,0.1575838539876307
Walrus harvest locations reflect adaptation: a contribution from a community-based observation network in the Bering Sea,"The Bering Sea Sub-Network, a Community-Based Observation Network, was initiated to improve knowledge of environmental changes occurring in the Bering Sea and to enable scientists, Arctic communities and governments to predict, plan and respond. Climate change can affect the health of the social-ecological system of Indigenous communities through negative effects to travel and changes to biological resources used for subsistence. Harvesters are perceptive of, and often have multigenerational knowledge about, the environmental conditions which subsistence activities are dependent upon. Community monitoring can detect local level environmental changes, and provide society with examples of adaptation strategies. Semi-structured interviews, with a participatory mapping component, were used to collect data on marine subsistence activity in Indigenous communities bordering the Bering Sea, in the Russian Federation and Alaska, USA. Spatial data allow exploration of human responses to change over time. In the Yup'ik village of Togiak, Alaska a shift has occurred in recent years in where residents harvest walrus, while seasonal regulations remain static. This may cause residents to travel farther in more dangerous conditions. The co-management system in place could be an effective forum to deal with change as it was structured to incorporate local input in adaptive management. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",0.37297905292972083,0.48497510241201813,0.15701809333179736,0.3140913438207318,0.2138742026617287,0.04832621265699027,0.06259408219776005
CLIMATIC ADAPTATION OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES ON THE SOUTHWEST OF TAIWAN,"Flooding is the most common and critical climatic disaster for coastal communities in Taiwan. This study applied an evaluation framework comprising five categories, namely ""community competence,"" ""infrastructure stability,"" ""social-economic support,"" ""interior environmental capacity,"" and ""outdoor environment adaptability,"" to six coastal communities of Tainan City, Taiwan, to evaluate their climatic adaptation. Having experienced multiple floods, all six communities performed relatively well in the infrastructure stability, but poorly in outdoor environment adaptability. In face-to-face interviews, interviewees reflected that the most vital sector affected by climate change is their fishing industry; however, the ""industry"" item was eliminated by experts during the implementation of the Fuzzy Delphi questionnaire. Therefore, beside the evaluation framework of community climatic adaptation, another contribution of this study is the execution of the interviews to reduce the inconsistency between real life situations and academic development.",0.1866341781681217,0.4672404834263052,0.08684923110468946,0.34237563980093233,0.23951203356750891,0.2617532935401254,0.09685701655864501
"National Adaptation Strategies, what else? Comparing adaptation mainstreaming in German and Dutch water management","Over the past decade, governments in many countries began to integrate or mainstream climate change adaptation into a range of sectors. Comprehensive multi-sectoral adaptation strategies have emerged as the preferred approach across Europe. The German Adaptation Strategy is a prominent example for such a comprehensive strategy. It addresses 14 sectors with national key issues and measures, and it provides orientation for other (mainly sub-national) actors. Against this trend, the Netherlands has pursued climate change adaptation mainly through a sectorally focused approach: the Dutch Delta Programme. Building on existing programmes,Governments in many it facilitates analysis and strategy development for long-term water management at a national scale with a strong regional focus. The present paper compares the two dissimilar governance approaches mainly with regard to how and to what degree they mainstream adaptation into water and coastal zone management in selected regions. After discussing strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, we conclude that the more common multi-sectoral approach applied in Germany and most other OECD countries is not necessarily superior to sectorally focused approaches. Although the Dutch and the German cases appear to resemble alternatives, we highlight that their combination holds the promise to compensate for each other's weaknesses. Overall, we argue that diversity in the governance of climate change adaptation is desirable because it can help to prevent that several countries fail in similar ways.",0.28370987629962335,0.30542985138530226,0.1786955280609288,0.2798653470716716,0.1153914878789929,0.3060094994475227,0.2948848513051524
Measuring the vulnerability of marine social-ecological systems: a prerequisite for the identification of climate change adaptations,"Reducing the vulnerability of coastal communities to marine climate change requires that communities have some intrinsic capacity to adapt. To assist adaptation planning and the implementation of adaptation strategies, identifying barriers and enablers to adaptation is important. Adaptive capacity, resource dependence, local climate change exposure and biological sensitivity were used to assess socioeconomic vulnerability to climate change in three Australian coastal communities: St Helens, Tasmania; Bowen, Queensland; and Geraldton, Western Australia. Higher adaptive capacity was associated with larger population size (i.e., Geraldton) whereas greater resource dependence, and lower human and natural capital were associated with smaller populations (St Helens and Bowen). Socioeconomic vulnerability was greatly influenced by climate exposure and sensitivity with the moderately sized Bowen having the highest socioeconomic vulnerability to climate change. Adaptation strategies that utilized available assets, improved adaptive capacity, or reduced socioeconomic vulnerability were identified in partnership with local communities, including increased and diversified employment opportunities, the re-establishment of local fish markets, and improved education and communication. The level of resources, or ""capitals,"" available to communities can indicate where barriers and enablers to adaptation exist. Identified barriers to adaptation included a heavy reliance on one sector for employment and a lack of physical capital. We demonstrate that knowledge of intrinsic community characteristics can be beneficial for prioritizing adaptation actions to reduce socioeconomic vulnerability to marine climate change.",0.6031437390397112,0.38509800582155423,0.1169592101391062,0.4190489142189494,0.3357070258902759,0.093253829440575,0.07688240670589978
Low-Regrets Incrementalism: Land Use Planning Adaptation to Accelerating Sea Level Rise in Florida's Coastal Communities,"Sea level rise is one of the climate change effects most amenable to adaptation planning as the impacts are familiar and the nature of the phenomenon is unambiguous. Yet, significant uncertainties remain. Using a normative framework of adaptive management and natural hazards planning, we examine how coastal communities in Florida are planning in the face of accelerating sea level rise through analysis of planning documents and interviews with planners. We clarify that communities are taking a low-regrets incremental approach with increasingly progressive measures motivated by confidence in planning intelligence and direct experience with impacts attributable to sea level rise.",0.0875752906197948,0.4112817661963483,0.15618111249321628,0.20141828986856664,0.4331874225789653,0.5851807416473738,0.16666065236790575
Synthesis of Water Infrastructure Adaptation Practices in US Coastal Regions,"One inevitable consequence of climate change is the rising sea level, which could adversely affect critical infrastructures in the coastal regions. Thirteen percent of the world population and 39% of the U.S. population resides in such coastal regions. Specifically, water resources and supporting water infrastructure in many coastal regions have become increasingly vulnerable to both quality and capacity issues. For example, nuisance-flooding events in low-lying coastal cities and salt-water intrusion into drinking water aquifers are becoming more frequent occurrences with rising sea levels. Several coastal states have already devised and implemented water infrastructure adaptation measures to effectively address the current and anticipated challenges of sea level rise. This paper presents the preliminary results of a comprehensive synthesis of water infrastructure adaptation practices in several coastal communities. A detailed review of policy documents published by various local, state and federal water infrastructure related agencies in the U.S. are reviewed to develop the database of water infrastructure adaptation strategies described in this paper.",0.11392534625803329,0.29072999799641164,0.11117553463243579,0.16389412217257412,0.4065833820548495,0.8323048640542189,0.8763957049360251
Flood risk mitigation in Europe: how far away are we from the aspired forms of adaptive governance?,"Flood mitigation is a strategy that is growing in importance across Europe. This growth corresponds with an increasing emphasis on the need to learn to live with floods and make space for water. Flood mitigation measures aim at reducing the likelihood and magnitude of flooding and complement flood defenses. They are being put in place through the implementation of actions that accommodate (rather than resist) water, such as natural flood management or adapted housing. The strategy has gained momentum over the past 20 years in an effort to improve the sustainability of flood risk management (FRM) and facilitate the diversification of FRM in the pursuit of societal resilience to flooding. Simultaneously, it is increasingly argued that adaptive forms of governance are best placed to address the uncertainty and complexity associated with social-ecological systems responding to environmental challenges, such as flooding. However, there have been few attempts to examine the extent to which current flood risk governance, and flood mitigation specifically, reflect these aspired forms of adaptive governance. Drawing from EU research into flood risk governance, conducted within the STAR-FLOOD project, we examine the governance of flood mitigation in six European countries: Belgium, England, France, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden. Using in-depth policy and legal analysis, as well as interviews with key actors, the governance and implementation of flood mitigation in these countries is evaluated from the normative viewpoint of whether, and to what extent, it can be characterized as adaptive governance. We identify five criteria of adaptive governance based on a comprehensive literature review and apply these to each country to determine the ""distance"" between current governance arrangements and adaptive governance. In conclusion, the flood mitigation strategy provides various opportunities for actors to further pursue forms of adaptive governance. The extent to which the mitigation strategy is capable of doing so varies across countries, however, and its role in stimulating adaptive governance was found to be strongest in Belgium and England.",0.06002288862980099,0.5,0.22821398916310873,0.12797515106624197,0.22850002459477534,0.7657336076401278,0.8684413325853582
"Climate change, hydro-meteorological hazards and adaptation for sustainable livelihood in Chitral Pakistan","This study contributes to the knowledge in the area pertaining to the Disaster Risk Reduction under overall domain of adaptation to climate change. Understanding occurrence and impacts of hydrometeorological disasters on people's well-being and which livelihood assets are significant for identifying coping strategies to deal with disasters are important ingredients to increased resilience of communities living in disaster prone areas. This study relies on the data collected using the Community-based Risk Screening Tool - Adaptation and Livelihoods (Cristal) to map major risks and vulnerabilities along with coping strategies then ascertaining their relationship with community-based livelihoods assets. According to results, there are three frequent disaster risks in the study area which comprise avalanches, landslides and floods. These disasters inflict a heavy damage to the livelihood assets including crops, water, houses and other physical infrastructure. In order to overcome these losses, communities apply short-term coping strategies by spending limited means and hard-earned cash reserves. These unsustainable strategies further exacerbate vulnerabilities and give way to new ones. Taking empirical example of Chitral, the study recommends to formulate policies and encourage investment to substitute short term coping strategies with long term climate change adaptation measures in order to minimize impact of devastating disasters in future. There is a need for improved governance of irrigation water management, channel management and effective management techniques for on-farm water. © 2019 Researchers Links.",0.3836681058162048,0.3146691977941156,0.12241037221777343,0.4503052043717851,0.09031542886339476,0.0705219728263908,0.40103721627539063
Are Wastewater Systems Adapting to Climate Change?,"Wastewater (WW) systems are vulnerable to extreme precipitation events; storm-induced WW system failures pollute the environment and put public health at risk. Despite these vulnerabilities, we know very little about how WW managers are responding to current climate risks or to future climate change. This study aims to fill this critical gap in the literature. Data from surveys and interviews were used to understand what WW managers are doing to adapt to the current climate, what facilitates those adaptations, and if they are adapting to future climate change. Findings show most WW managers (78%) are making changes to build resiliency to storms they have experienced in the past (e.g., extra fuel on site, extra staff on call, more training, better communication, adding generators, elevating components, adding capacity); most are not adapting to future climate change. Our work suggests organizational leadership, concern about future climate-related impacts, and experiencing storm impacts drive resiliency changes while regulatory requirements drive adaptation to future climate change. Beyond advancing science, our work offers practical suggestions for building WW system resilience and for increasing WW system's consideration of future climate impacts in their resiliency building efforts.",0.3367238396417408,0.3853986734993283,0.18699227949633151,0.26458134877756584,0.08468767455162787,0.08606240437159167,0.11736052460485745
Evaluating risk communication during extreme weather and climate change: a scoping review,"Introduction: Communicating risk to the public continues to be a challenge for public health practitioners working in the area of climate change. We conducted a scoping literature review on the evaluation of risk communication for extreme weather and climate change to inform local public health messaging, consistent with requirements under the Ontario Public Health Standards (OPHS), which were updated in 2018 to include effective communication regarding climate change and extreme weather. Methods: Search strategies were developed by library information specialists and used to retrieve peer-reviewed academic and grey literature from bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase, Scopus and CINAHL) and Google country specific searches, respectively. The search strategy was validated through a workshop with experts and community stakeholders, with expertise in environment, health, emergency management and risk communication. Results: A total of 43 articles were included. These articles addressed issues such as: climate change (n = 22), flooding (n = 12), hurricane events (n = 5), extreme heat (n = 2), and wild fires (n = 2). Studies were predominantly from the US (n = 14), Europe (n = 6) and Canada (n = 5). Conclusion: To meet the OPHS 2018, public health practitioners need to engage in effective risk communication to motivate local actions that mitigate the effects of extreme weather and climate change. Based on the scoping review, risk communication efforts during short-term extreme weather events appear to be more effective than efforts to communicate risk around climate change. This distinction could highlight a unique opportunity for public health to adapt strategies commonly used for extreme weather to climate change.",0.11342628331161048,0.5424235134432558,0.11847468489344043,0.14463549248539787,0.024906510539440412,0.18529812952066865,0.08661298324411527
"Autonomous household responses and urban governance capacity building for climate change adaptation: Georgetown, Guyana","Governance dynamics and the interplay between inadequate infrastructural investment and institutional inertia undermine the potential of low-income cities in low-elevation coastal zones to become climate change resilient. This paper explores the influence of these factors as well as household socio-economic characteristics on autonomous household adaptation to climate change. George-town, Guyana is used as a case study. Empirical analysis revealed that state inability to solve socio-economic, infrastructural and environmental problems led urban households to independently adopt measures aimed at reducing climate change impacts. Spontaneous maladaptation by all households in response to state failure and weak urban governance, however, exacerbated vulnerability to flooding. The paper has global applicability in that it cautions policymakers and practitioners on the shortcomings of spontaneous maladaptation, and provides prescriptions for improved urban governance and spatial planning to facilitate the climate proofing of cities. Furthermore, it highlights the importance and complexities of financing climate change adaptation, and concludes these will continue to constrain the adaptive capacity of vulnerable city populations in the less developed countries of the South, unless developed global partners cooperate.

Interdisciplinary approach to hydrological hazard mitigation and disaster response and effects of climate change on the occurrence of flood severity in central Alaska,"In May 2013, a massive ice jam on the Yukon River caused flooding that destroyed much of the infrastructure in the Interior Alaska village of Galena and forced the long-term evacuation of nearly 70% of its residents. This case study compares the communication efforts of the out-of-state emergency response agents with those of the Alaska River Watch program, a state-operated flood preparedness and community outreach initiative. For over 50 years, the River Watch program has been fostering long-lasting, open, and reciprocal communication with flood prone communities, as well as local emergency management and tribal officials. By taking into account cultural, ethnic, and socioeconomic features of rural Alaskan communities, the River Watch program was able to establish and maintain a sense of partnership and reliable communication patterns with communities at risk. As a result, officials and residents in these communities are open to information and guidance from the River Watch during the time of a flood, and thus are poised to take prompt actions. By informing communities of existing ice conditions and flood threats on a regular basis, the River Watch provides effective mitigation efforts in terms of ice jam flood effects reduction. Although other ice jam mitigation attempts had been made throughout US and Alaskan history, the majority proved to be futile and/or cost-ineffective. Galena, along with other rural riverine Alaskan communities, has to rely primarily on disaster response and recovery strategies to withstand the shock of disasters. Significant government funds are spent on these challenging efforts and these expenses might be reduced through an improved understanding of both the physical and climatological principals behind river ice breakup and risk mitigation. This study finds that long term dialogue is critical for effective disaster response and recovery during extreme hydrological events connected to changing climate, timing of river ice breakup, and flood occurrence in rural communities of the Far North.",0.15852107886459635,0.461772875899854,0.17429234315130085,0.3302058770054781,0.15173556863706028,0.3812943837870914,0.6950069262825856
"Adaptation strategies to cope with low, high and untimely floods: Lessons from the Gash spate irrigation system, Sudan","In arid areas, water diverted from highly uncertain flash floods is often the only source of water for crop production. Stakeholders in spate irrigation systems have developed numerous measures to cope with uncertain water supply related to low, high and untimely floods. This research evaluates the effectiveness of these measures using the MULINO Decision Support System (mDSS4) tool which is based on the Driving force-PressureState-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. Using data from interviews with 101 randomly selected farmers, 17 water user associations (WUAs), and 7 system water managers in the Gash spate irrigation system in Sudan, we compare the effectiveness with the rate of adoption. The results reveal the most effective measures are 1) pre-flood preparedness, 2) risk sharing measures through water and land management during and after flood by WUAs, 3) crop management by farmers; and 4) flexibility in operation by water managers. Unfortunately, the most effective measures are not the most adopted ones. The level of adoption is primarily related to the capacity of the farmers, WUAs and water managers to implement the measures without outside support. Generally, measures taken by downstream farmers are less effective than those adopted by upstream farmers due to weak institutional arrangements and lack of adequate resources. Supporting farmers, WUAs and water managers for a wider adoption of the existing effective measures will greatly improve irrigation performance and hence food security in the study area.",0.8774301715372692,0.15528028571277872,0.13961094118656522,0.24490365803791103,0.029389870538399993,0.13231833670684107,0.9445484709890305
Perception of Climate Change Risk and Adaptation in the Czech Republic,"Public perception of climate change is an important element that affects attitudes towards adaptation and mitigation. Understanding the general public's perception of the issue can assist decision-makers, though the climate change perception is affected by multiple factors. This study examines the main sociodemographic factors, including gender, and the role of previous personal experience with extreme weather events on climate change perception and engagement in individual adaptation and mitigation actions among the general population in the Czech Republic. Based on statistical analysis, gender, age and previous experience with extreme weather events have been found to play a significant role in the climate change beliefs of individuals and in the perception of the cause of the changing climate. The analysis revealed that respondents with previous experience with extreme weather events were significantly more likely to implement adaptation and mitigation actions than respondents with no experience. The survey represents insights into climate change perception and beliefs of the general public at the national level.",0.43501698162415037,0.36515303368346064,0.07705662031133181,0.20545441113484583,0.034659560897970836,0.07538485678939066,0.1263370784963298
"Adaptation to Climate Change in an Interior Pacific Island Village: a Case Study of Nawairuku, Ra, Fiji","We examine how residents of Nawairuku, an interior village in Ra, Fiji, are experiencing and responding to recent social and ecological changes. An analysis of data collected using semi-structured interviews with 27 households reveals that household adaptability - the ability or capacity to adapt to the impacts of climatic variations - depends on access to livelihood assets. All households have access to social capital through familial networks, which lessens the burden of extreme weather events, namely cyclones and flooding. Households with access to tangible assets such as land and the equipment and resources to utilize it, together with intangible assets like motivation and knowledge are better positioned to adapt their agricultural practices to changing climatic conditions. Households headed by a capable individual were also better positioned to adapt. We conclude that remoteness promotes self-sufficiency and initiative, and access to livelihood assets influences household capacity to adapt.",0.6954965238483628,0.425354145571927,0.10186308523822894,0.6480493465554682,0.08352014226081587,0.046253298197110895,0.07144326259389146
Artificial lakes as a climate change adaptation strategy in drylands: evaluating the trade-off on non-target ecosystem services,"Drylands are very susceptible to the effects of climate change due to water stress. One possible climate change adaptation measure is the construction of lakes to increase water availability for drinking and irrigation (food production) and decrease fire risk. These lakes can also increase local biodiversity and human well-being. However, other non-target services such as carbon (C) storage, water purification, and sediment retention might also change. Our main aim was to evaluate the trade-offs on non-targeted ecosystem services due to lakes construction in drylands. This was done using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) modeling tools, comparing a Mediterranean area located in southwest (SW) Europe, with and without artificial lakes. Results showed that the construction of artificial lakes caused an increase of 9.4% in C storage. However, the consequent increase in agricultural area decreased water purification and sediment retention services. This could diminish the life span of the lakes changing the initial beneficial cost-benefit analysis on lakes as adaptation measures to climate change. As a global measure for mitigation and adaptation to climate change strategy, we consider lake construction in drylands to be positive since it can store C in sediments and reduces the vulnerability to water scarcity. However, as a general recommendation and when built to support or increase agriculture in semi-arid landscapes, we consider that lakes should be complemented with additional measures to reduce soil erosion and nutrient leaching such as (i) locate agricultural areas outside the lakes water basin, (ii) afforestation surrounding the lakes, and (iii) adopt the best local agriculture practices to prevent and control soil erosion and nutrient leaching.",0.7158046327327474,0.20207260451818726,0.13547351199093763,0.2532739359404174,0.021893082283373434,0.06311560876164275,0.5
Resilience to flash floods in wetland communities of northeastern Bangladesh,"Globally, a number of catastrophic hydrometeorological hazards occurred in 2017 among which the monsoon floods in South Asia was particularly disastrous, killing nearly 1200 people in India, Nepal and Bangladesh. The wetland region (Haor) of northeastern (NE) Bangladesh was severely affected by flash floods early in 2017, affecting nearly 1 million households and damaging US $ 450 million worth of rice crops. This study investigates how the NE Bangladesh experienced the 2017 flash floods, and to what degree the wetland communities are vulnerable and resilience to flash floods. Focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and household questionnaire surveys (n=80) were applied in the study area of Sunamganj district. Results from statistical analyses and regression modelling reveal that poor people are particularly vulnerable to floods but they are also more adaptive and thus resilient; middle-income households are vulnerable as they are hesitant to take up any jobs and accept flood relief; and rich households, despite being less adaptive, are able to recover from flood disasters because of wealth. This study reveals that resilience also stems from deep religious faith in the Haor inhabitants that supports communities to move on by accepting that most natural calamities such as flash floods are divine tests. This study also finds that women are particularly vulnerable and less resilient as they are not normally allowed to work outside of their homes and beyond the Haor communities due to cultural and religious reasons.",0.5418955050834857,0.36896416299460727,0.0682713939143544,0.5659408560820778,0.11881553998716653,0.13448834935525839,0.30363560069842227
Expert assessment of the resilience of drinking water and sanitation systems to climate-related hazards,"We conducted an expert assessment to obtain expert opinions on the relative global resilience of ten drinking water and five sanitation technologies to the following six climate-related hazards: drought, decreased interannual precipitation, flood, superstorm flood, wind damage, and saline intrusion. Resilience scores ranged from 1.7 to 9.9 out of a maximum resilience of 10, with high scores corresponding to high resilience. We find that for some climate-related hazards, such as drought, technologies demonstrated a large range in resilience, indicating that the choice ofwater and sanitation technologies is important for areas prone to drought. On the other hand, the range of resilience scores for superstorm floodingwasmuch smaller, particularly for sanitation technologies, suggesting that the choice of technology is less of a determinant of functionality for superstorm flooding as compared to other climate-related hazards. For drinking water technologies, only treated piped utility-managed systems that use surfacewater had resilience scores >6.0 for all hazards, while protected dug wells were found to be one of the least resilient technologies, consistently scoring <5.0 for all hazards except wind damage. In general, sanitation technologies were found to have low to medium resilience, suggesting that sanitation systems need to be adapted to ensure functionality during and after climate-related hazards. The results of the study can be used to help communities decide which technologies are best suited for the climate-related challenges they face and help in future adaptation planning.

Evaluating the suitability of community-based adaptation: A case study of bangladesh,"Community-Based Adaptation (CBA) is increasingly recognised as a promising approach for the most vulnerable people to adapt to climate change impacts. However, CBA has conceptual and procedural challenges, e.g., lacking of an established theory. Under this context evaluating the suitability of CBA merits a closer look. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the suitability of CBA to determine the positive and negative factors of it so that the application of CBA can contribute more to build communityâ€™s adaptive capacity. A hybrid method Analytical Hierarchy Process in SWOT was applied to derive the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) around CBA, drawing a case study in flood-affected, drought-affected and coastal areas of Bangladesh. Results overwhelmingly explain the presence of strengths and opportunities of CBA to climate impacts, and the low importance of threats and weaknesses around CBA. The study indicates CBA has a lot of potential for building climate resilience and/or adaptive capacityâ€”by building social assetsâ€”and fostering transformational adaptation, which requires a meticulous CBA planning for addressing diverse social contexts, the dynamics of vulnerability, and their linkages with socioeconomic processes. Yet, practitioners must find ways to overcoming the challenges through placing communities at the heart of CBAâ€™s planning and implementation, and complementary actions across levels. Concrete policy implications are outlined to enhance the effectiveness of CBA.

Are We Adapting to Floods? Evidence from Global Flooding Fatalities,"There has been a growing interest in understanding whether and how people adapt to extreme weather events in a changing climate. This article presents one of the first empirical analyses of adaptation to flooding on a global scale. Using a sample of 97 countries between 1985 and 2010, we investigate the extent and pattern of flood adaptation by estimating the effects of a country's climatological risk, recent flood experiences, and socioeconomic characteristics on its flood-related fatalities. Our results provide mixed evidence on adaptation: countries facing greater long-term climatological flooding risks do not necessarily adapt better and suffer fewer fatalities; however, after controlling for the cross-country heterogeneity, we find that more recent flooding shocks have a significant and negative effect on fatalities from subsequent floods. These findings may suggest the short-term learning dynamics of adaptation and potential inefficacy of earlier flood control measures, particularly those that promote increased exposure in floodplains. Our findings provide important implications for climate adaptation policy making and climate modeling.",0.23200746370148617,0.410474803221712,0.11648465995874216,0.23071718905065666,0.12551169598378895,0.37542652364218,0.5988699865988844
EFFECTIVE WATER MANAGEMENT AS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN POLISH CITIES,"As indicated by the Strategic Plan of Adaptation to Climate Change in Poland (SPA 2020), sectors sensitive to the impact of climate change are ""water management"" and ""spatial economy and urbanized areas"". Cities are directly threatened by three phenomena: the intensification of the urban heat island, heavy downpours causing flooding, and drought, which is conducive to water deficit in cities. The aims of this study are: (1) a comparative analysis of the impact of climate change on water management - in Poland and other EU countries, (2) an analysis of the public water supply level in Poland and EU countries, (3) an assessment of the involvement of Polish cities in adapting to the climate to other EU countries - a comparative analysis of the Eurostat index ""Population covered by the Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy"", and (4) an evaluation of how the adaptive policy has been implemented in the field of water management in Polish cities - a survey carried out among the cities in the project ""Let's feel the climate!"".",0.1477188994448276,0.2928826834482478,0.13649307569885946,0.20544718725276664,0.051868533017996064,0.5747610376919206,0.6428318712316468
Flood in a Changing Climate: The Impact on Livelihood and How the Rural Poor Cope in Bangladesh,"It is already documented that climate change will lead to an intensification of the global water cycle with a consequent increase in flood hazards. Bangladesh is also facing an increasing trend of flood disasters. Among the various risks and disasters in Bangladesh, flood is the most common and frequent. Floods make people vulnerable, as they take away their livelihoods at the first instance and leave them with little resources to overcome from the situation. Because of floods, rural poor communities face job loss, and two-thirds of their income is reduced, which limits their capabilities of preparedness, response, and recovery to subsequent floods. People cope with the situation by bearing substantial debts and a loss of productive assets. With an empirical field study in one of the most flood-prone upazilas (sub-districts) of Bangladesh, namely Goalanda Upazilla of the Rajbari district, this study intends to draw a flood impact tree of the study area. It also examines the impacts of flood on the livelihood of the rural poor and explores their coping strategies. This paper aims to facilitate an understanding of the impact of floods on their livelihood, especially on the income and occupations of the rural poor. At the same time, it aims to learn from their coping mechanisms.",0.2837697440198925,0.364366567434722,0.11989305110954641,0.5108358571154961,0.10204406302754769,0.26679547695722333,0.7431219821356256
"Determinants of flood risk mitigation strategies at household level: a case of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, Pakistan","Pakistan is one of the most adversely affected countries by climate-related extreme events such as floods owing to its geographical and climatic conditions. Over the last two decades, frequency and severity of flood events have been increased and has adversely affected the livelihood and well-being of millions of people in Pakistan. The development of effective mitigation policies requires a clear understanding of the impacts and local responses to extreme events, which is quite limited in Pakistan. This study used a dataset of 600 households collected through face-to-face interviews from two districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province that were severely affected from 2010 floods. The correlation and probit model methods are used to assess the study objectives. The findings of the study revealed that elevated ground floor, foundation strengthening, construction of house with reinforced material and precautionary savings were the main adaptation measures adopted at household level. The results from the probit model showed that gender, age, location, monthly income, family size, house ownership, disability, and education influence the households' choices of mitigation strategies. The study further indicated that adoption of mitigation strategies at household level is constrained by several factors, i.e.,financial constraint, lack of early warning system, lack of land use planning and inadequate resources. Further mitigation strategies also varied across different groups of households based on education, age, and income. Additionally the study discovered that the local policies on disaster management need to be improved to address the barriers to the adoption of advanced level adaptation measures at the household level such as advanced level early warning system, flood forecasting and dissemination of updated information and support, house building codes, infrastructure building practices, and adequate spatial planning.",0.5863188298749077,0.26848184567497996,0.09204278195249257,0.48967985083526716,0.07484144085518324,0.12260789117102466,0.31462569223420067
Stimulating flood damage mitigation through insurance: an assessment of the French CatNat system,"Flood risk has increased in France in the last 20 years and is projected to increase further in the future due to climate change and increase in exposure. Since 1982, France has had a natural disasters insurance system (CatNat') in place that covers flood damage. This insurance system has been combined with what are called Risk Prevention Plans' (PPRs) in order to stimulate the undertaking of flood risk mitigation measures by communities and households. However, these schemes do not provide optimal incentives for flood damage reduction. This is confirmed by the results from a survey about flood preparedness of 885 households who live in flood-prone areas in France, which are presented in this paper. Moreover, this study provides suggestions for improvement, which are assessed on their potential economic, social and political implications. Among these suggestions are increasing the effectiveness of PPRs and increasing the incentives to apply and implement PPRs; improving the monitoring of the implementation of damage mitigation measures; and the possibility to differentiate premiums and deductibles according to flood risk.",0.20138370744461315,0.3669900804749192,0.14799082772612687,0.22600834111259333,0.1456780438177992,0.5653240795057103,0.852205353068394
The determinants of private flood mitigation measures in Germany - Evidence from a nationwide survey,"Public flood protection cannot eliminate totally the risk of flooding. Hence, private mitigation measures which proactively protect homes from being flooded or reduce flood damage are an essential part of modern flood risk management. This study analyses private flood mitigation measures among German households. The final data set covers more than 4200 households from all parts of the country, including flood plains as well as areas which are typically not at a high risk of riverine flooding. The results suggest that the propensity to mitigate flood damage increases i.a. with past damage experience and damage expectations for the future. The latter effect can be interpreted as a 'climate adaptation signal' in the flood mitigation behaviour. All other factors remaining equal, a strong belief in a climate-change-induced increase of personal flood damage in the next decades correlates with an increase of the probability of flood mitigation by more than 10 percentage points. Moreover, empirical evidence for moral hazard in the flood mitigation behaviour cannot be observed. Households expecting insurance coverage do not reduce their mitigation efforts. Likewise, the expectation of government relief payments hinders mitigation only for some groups of households. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A Comparative Study of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation on Flood Management Between Ayutthaya City (Thailand) and Samarinda City (Indonesia),"Increased population and urban growth have made converting open spaces that can cause flooding. Thailand and Indonesia are two of the most prone areas to various types of disaster but especially to floods. However, the climate change is the significance factor impact to floods risk. The climate change makes direct and indirect effects to floods. In addition, adaptation and mitigation to climate change are an important aspect to reduce and prevent the impact of floods. This paper tries to explore flood management in Ayutthaya, Thailand and Samarinda, Indonesia. Primary and secondary data are used in this paper. This objective of this paper is done by using qualitative analysis. This paper shows that the flood risk on both cities has same characteristics and indicates that the role of government of Ayutthaya also stronger than Samarinda. The comparison shows that flood management especially on adaptation is main challenges for Indonesia government that will require further plan to establish how manage water, and increase adaptive capacity for reduce the flood damage. This paper provides us to understand the important of climate change adaptation in real cases. As flood hazard, we learn about the impact of big flood causing to damage loss in many sectors, and we also learn to assess the risk by assess vulnerability and adaptive capacity.

Marshaling Adaptive Capacities within an Adaptive Management Framework to Enhance the Resiliency of Wastewater Systems,"We assess adaptive capacity and adaptive management as measures of wastewater (WW) system resiliency using data from interviews with WW system managers (hereafter managers) impacted by past storms. Results suggest the most resilient WW systems are those with high adaptive capacities that employ an adaptive management approach to make ongoing adaptation investments over time. Greater amounts of generic adaptive capacities (i.e., skilled staff and good leadership) help smooth both day-to-day and emergency operations and provide a foundation for adaptive management. In turn, adaptive management helps managers both build more generic adaptive capacities, and develop and employ greater amounts and diversity of specific adaptive capacities (i.e., soft and/or hard adaptations) that are especially important for enhancing and sustaining resiliency. Adaptive management also enables managers to better understand their system's vulnerabilities, how those vulnerabilities change over time, and what specific actions may reduce those vulnerabilities. Finally, our work suggests WW system resilience critically depends on the capacities of the human systems for building resilience as much as or more so than relying only on physical infrastructure resilience. Our work contributes to filling an important gap in the literature by advancing our understanding of the human dimensions of infrastructure resilience and has practical implications for advancing resilience in the WW sector.",0.3337524660028301,0.3511056366238749,0.37054481998170075,0.20934173375701542,0.13409553699388124,0.1003710882821531,0.1249838423440978
Eco-districts: can they accelerate urban climate planning?,"Despite signing the Mayors Climate Change Agreement, few US cities have made significant progress in either climate mitigation or adaptation. For the most part, European cities have been more effective, albeit with assistance from the European Union and their national governments. Several of the most successful European cities have implemented eco-districts, which have offered many lessons for overall sustainability planning. Using Malmo, Sweden as a case study, we ask how planners and elected officials learned from implementing an eco-district, focusing on experimentation with new technologies and approaches to planning. We identify how ""double-loop learning"", a term coined by Argyris and Shon, was at play in changing planning practice. As eco-districts are catching on in North American cities, there is much to be learned from European practice.",0.19257023890911087,0.37739540870808486,0.07687063459244356,0.18205068120758672,0.08143433623522618,0.45131480829813375,0.10871802106192474
A Comparison of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for the Construction Industries of Three Coastal Territories,"The success of climate change strategies depends on how well mitigation and adaptation measures are implemented. It is especially important to implement effective mitigation and adaptation measures in coastal territories because they will be more directly affected by some of the possible effects of climate change. This study assessed and compared how Singapore, Miami-Dade and San Francisco - three coastal territories - implement climate change strategies in their construction industries. Case study method - in which primary and secondary information was collected and analyzed - was used. It was found that these three territories have a few similarities; for example, Singapore and San Francisco mandate green building requirements, whereas Singapore and Miami-Dade do not explicitly consider adaptation measures in their building codes. It was also noted that although mitigation has entered mainstream policy-making, adaptation still lags behind. Consequently, this study has proposed a few lessons; for example, policy-makers in Singapore and Miami-Dade should complement existing measures with platforms to engage the public on disaster management.

Community vulnerability to changes in the winter road viability and longevity in the western James Bay region of Ontario's Far North,"A network of winter roads that consists of snow-ice roads over land, muskeg, and frozen lakes and rivers has been and continues to be a critical seasonal lifeline in remote-northern First Nation (FN) communities in Ontario's Far North. This study examines current vulnerability of the Fort Albany community to physical, social, and economic impacts associated with the changing of the viability and longevity of winter roads and its seasons, as well as the river ice regimes. Semi-directive interviews with key informants (n = 8) and structured surveys with winter road users (n = 54) were conducted to gather local knowledge about the evolution of winter roads and climatic and environmental changes in winter road conditions and seasons. Trends in the river ice breakup and flood events for the Moose River, Albany River, and Attawapiskat River were also examined. The results of this study indicate that climatic factors, particularly air temperature and snowfall, have directly affected the construction and maintenance of the James Bay Winter Road. Trend analyses of spring flooding for the three rivers exhibit statistically significant increases (p <= 0.01) over the past few decades; thus, flooding in nearby communities has become a more significant threat in recent years. A few short- and medium-term adaptation strategies have been initiated in response to the impacts of climate change on winter roads; however, developing long-term planning and feasible adaptation for remote-northern communities in Ontario's Far North is necessary.",0.3781877689053984,0.39507516588555813,0.10360122662405138,0.3118983235519176,0.10149234786477467,0.13953070457346586,0.2018880086542749
"Social adaptability in ecotones: sea-level rise and climate change adaptation in Flushing and the Isles of Scilly, UK","Coastal zones and small islands are among the areas most impacted by global climate change and face great challenges for adaptation. While being considered as particularly vulnerable, many coastal communities, nevertheless, have long traditions of living not only by but with the sea. If such ecotones. places where ecosystems intersect. have features distinct from purely continental regions, the question is how life with the shore translates into adaptability towards environmental change. Life at the shore shapes emergent social relationships, local traditions, and collective memory. At the same time, issues such as tourism development, demographic change, and national and international administrations influence how environmental challenges in coastal areas are addressed. In this paper, I analyse how place-specific social structures and conflicting influences in ecotones affect adaptability to sea-level rise in coastal areas. This research draws on quantitative and qualitative data from a comparative study of two case studies, a coastal town and an archipelago, in Southwest England.",0.12367903451290096,0.4518414610250315,0.09920852437798158,0.3231357849897804,0.6030829915119669,0.4034104675788031,0.16807154498052665
Assessing the impacts of climate change in cities and their adaptive capacity: Towards transformative approaches to climate change adaptation and poverty reduction in urban areas in a set of developing countries,"Many cities across the world are facing many problems climate change poses to their populations, communities and infrastructure. These vary from increased exposures to floods, to discomfort due to urban heat, depending on their geographical locations and settings. However, even though some cities have a greater ability to cope with climate change challenges, many struggle to do so, particularly in cities in developing countries. In addition, there is a shortage of international studies which examine the links between climate change adaptation and cities, and which at the same time draw some successful examples of good practice, which may assist future efforts. This paper is an attempt to address this information need. The aim of this paper is to analyse the extent to which cities in a sample of developing countries are attempting to pursue climate change adaptation and the problems which hinder this process. Its goal is to showcase examples of initiatives and good practice in transformative adaptation, which may be replicable elsewhere. To this purpose, the paper describes some trends related to climate change in a set of cities in developing countries across different continents, including one of the smallest capital cities (Georgetown, Guyana) and Shanghai, one the world's most populous cities. In particular, it analyses their degree of vulnerability, how they manage to cope with climate change impacts, and the policies being implemented to aid adaptation. It also suggests the use of transformative approaches which may be adopted, in order to assist them in their efforts towards investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure, thereby maximizing investments in urban areas and trying to address their related poverty issues. This paper addresses a gap in the international literature on the problems many cities in developing countries face, in trying to adapt to a changing climate. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Implementing Green Infrastructure in Spatial Planning in Europe,"Interest in green infrastructure (GI) has grown in research, policy and planning in recent decades. The central idea behind GI is the understanding of the physical non-built-up environment as an infrastructure capable of delivering a wide variety of benefits to society, including the ability to preserve biodiversity; to provide food, feed, fuel and fibre; to adapt to and mitigate climate change and to contribute to enhanced human health and quality of life. The European Union (EU) has had a GI strategy since 2013, and member states are involved in several strategic and applied GI initiatives and projects. The aim of this study is to explore if and how the European strategy has been implemented. The study adds to the body of knowledge of current GI policies and measures in Europe via an online survey and insights into previous research. The survey reveals that GI is integrated into one or more policy sectors in all 32 countries covered. In 11 of the 32 countries, GI-specific policies are already in place or are being drawn up at a national level. In general, the respondents see the responsibility for GI policy and strategy as a matter of national governments and the implementation as a matter of local governments. They also see the LIFE+ and Horizon 2020 project funds, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), as the most important EU funding sources for the implementation of the GI strategy. The study also identifies availability of georeferenced information, zoning and biotope area factor as three of the spatial planning tools used to implement GI.",0.2493189901273809,0.38973769737132313,0.12621066869903813,0.2861800488240737,0.08960777675489959,0.24084618990440274,0.13708816347805167
Informing notions of climate change adaptation: a case study of everyday gendered realities of climate change adaptation in an informal settlement in Dar es Salaam,"This paper examines the gendered dynamics of climate change adaptation in a rapidly urbanizing area of the global South. As climate change adaptation gains increasing prominence in global environmental policies and development strategies, there is a tendency to conceptualize adaptation as a technical process, disconnected from the everyday reality of how adaptation is practised by people facing negative climate change impacts. We present evidence from a small-scale case study of a flood-prone informal settlement in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to provide a contextually grounded contribution to a growing body of literature on gender, climate change and cities. We argue that the way climate change impacts are perceived, experienced and adapted to on an everyday level is characterized by gendered differences (among others). We demonstrate that a greater understanding of these gendered nuances highlights the disconnect between everyday gendered realities and a high-level technical notion of adaptation deployed at strategic and policy levels.",0.3900283032408869,0.4127351837207816,0.11447225155599293,0.3775520839740007,0.0921786334350408,0.1540982880108987,0.11752531101416264
"Sea-level rise adaptation measures in local communities of Zhejiang Province, China","China is a country that is particularly negatively affected by the challenge of sea-level rise (SLR), which will increasingly threaten the country's coastlines. As a result, it is vital that China's local communities adapt to these impacts. This paper assesses how local decision-makers in coastal communities of Zhejiang Province perceive SLR adaptation and how the decision-makers act on these perceptions. We also investigate the effect of an information brochure on local decision-makers' knowledge, awareness, and policy actions regarding SLR adaptation. The results show that decision-makers located along the Zhejiang coast have little knowledge of climate change and SLR, and they do not place a high priority on the issue of SLR. While providing local decision-makers with relevant information could increase their knowledge and awareness of the need to act, it will not necessarily lead to action. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Drowning the suburb: settlement planning and climate change adaptation in a Hungarian metropolitan area,"Urban planning can contribute to reducing vulnerability to the impacts of climate change (including the expected increased occurrence of extreme weather events) in metropolitan areas. However, lack of urban governance and planning focusing on the metropolitan area as a whole, and decisions that do not take into account sufficiently the occurrence of such events, can substantially increase the cost of recovery from weather-related disasters. This policy study connects climate change adaptation, urban planning and metropolitan governance issues in the Hungarian context, focusing on the June 2010 floods in the town of Felso{double acute}zsolca, in the Miskolc metropolitan area. A review of key literature is provided on the impacts of climate change in cities and on governing climate action in metropolitan areas. Events leading up to and following the June 2010 Felso{double acute}zsolca floods are analysed from the perspective of urban planning. Based on evaluation criteria including effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, institutional capacity, transparency, political feasibility and time, four policy options are identified for climate action-related governance and planning in metropolitan areas, in the Hungarian context. Based on the above criteria, formalized horizontal partnerships between local authorities within the metropolitan area are chosen as the most favourable and currently most feasible policy option in Hungary. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",0.11759420708848488,0.335089151971068,0.13115798441008752,0.2187592766715448,0.09750735049490249,0.6458844957635669,0.28322351192934964
A survey of urban climate change experiments in 100 cities,"Cities are key sites where climate change is being addressed. Previous research has largely overlooked the multiplicity of climate change responses emerging outside formal contexts of decision-making and led by actors other than municipal governments. Moreover, existing research has largely focused on case studies of climate change mitigation in developed economies. The objective of this paper is to uncover the heterogeneous mix of actors, settings, governance arrangements and technologies involved in the governance of climate change in cities in different parts of the world. The paper focuses on urban climate change governance as a process of experimentation. Climate change experiments are presented here as interventions to try out new ideas and methods in the context of future uncertainties. They serve to understand how interventions work in practice, in new contexts where they are thought of as innovative. To study experimentation, the paper presents evidence from the analysis of a database of 627 urban climate change experiments in a sample of 100 global cities. The analysis suggests that, since 2005, experimentation is a feature of urban responses to climate change across different world regions and multiple sectors. Although experimentation does not appear to be related to particular kinds of urban economic and social conditions, some of its core features are visible. For example, experimentation tends to focus on energy. Also, both social and technical forms of experimentation are visible, but technical experimentation is more common in urban infrastructure systems. While municipal governments have a critical role in climate change experimentation; they often act alongside other actors and in a variety of forms of partnership. These findings point at experimentation as a key tool to open up new political spaces for governing climate change in the city. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Identifying characteristics of resilient urban communities through a case study method,"With an increasing acknowledgement of climate variability, the important role of resilience in achieving healthy urban ecosystems has also been discussed by the academics recently. The literature however shows ambiguity about the characteristics of urban resilience, while substantive progress has been made in the practice of resilience building in urban communities. To bridge the gap between theory and practices, this paper dedicate to answer the question: What are the typical characteristics of resilient urban communities? Using the research method of case study, the paper screens and analyzes four exemplary cases of resilient urban communities from around the world, articulating the specific resilient strategies and their core resilient concept of each case. Finally, eight characteristics in four performance dimensions are distilled and explained. The identification of the characteristics provides a scenario of resilient urban community, and it also gives the direction for fostering the urban community resilience.",0.19399919186082212,0.3719334470703662,0.08272815737443835,0.2724433748136311,0.08829502156409796,0.6015918973778822,0.17873725282309416
"City and Building Designers, and Climate Adaptation","For cities, climate change is a major concern due to its severe impacts and its inherent complexity. City and building designers could be pivotal actors, but have yet to fully take on this role. Research can support adaptation action through greater collaboration with practitioners and a better understanding of their knowledge and practices. This paper presents results from a research project undertaken in Toulouse (France) last year. Urban practitioners were consulted through an online survey and observed in action during two design workshops. The findings highlight: (i) the hidden knowledge within design practice; (ii) the importance of providing designers with solution-focused and form-giving data; and (iii) the potential offered by design constraints to trigger changes in the practices of professionals.",0.3463913897221871,0.36258373395698307,0.0919451492871534,0.27772645935777884,0.041978383878138466,0.29107187593587175,0.10090847591650665
Information and communication technology and climate change adaptation: Evidence from selected mining companies in South Africa,"The mining sector is a significant contributor to the gross domestic product of many global economies. Given the increasing trends in climate-induced disasters and the growing desire to find lasting solutions, information and communication technology (ICT) has been introduced into the climate change adaptation mix. Climate change-induced extreme weather events such as flooding, drought, excessive fog, and cyclones have compounded the environmental challenges faced by the mining sector. This article presents the adoption of ICT innovation as part of the adaptation strategies towards reducing the mining sector's vulnerability and exposure to climate change disaster risks. Document analysis and systematic literature review were adopted as the methodology. Findings from the study reflect how ICT intervention orchestrated changes in communication patterns which are tailored towards the reduction in climate change vulnerability and exposure. The research concludes with a proposition that ICT intervention must be part of the bigger and ongoing climate change adaptation agenda in the mining sector.",0.40073672123937704,0.38044619403620883,0.14824003741836195,0.28308148797404215,0.10961907670949331,0.11965858680566173,0.13847045043734044
Climate change adaptation in Europe and the United States: A comparative approach to urban green spaces in Bilbao and New York City,"Climate change adaptation policies in the United States and Europe have common aims but a different initial focus. While in the United States the principal factor when establishing adaptation plans and programs is based on risk control, the criterion in most European countries is directly linked to strategies of urban regeneration and sustainability. In both cases, cities are taking up the initiative to define adaptation strategies without waiting for state legislative acts. This article focuses on analysis of the ability of Urban Green Spaces to promote adaptation to climate change for both risk control and as an urban regeneration resource. With the analysis of two urban regeneration cases studied in zones affected by climate change, Red Hook in New York and Zorrotzaurre in Bilbao, the adaptation policies in the United States and Europe are studied. These cases allow a focus on how cities' capacities to establish initiatives for specific adaptation measures include Urban Green Spaces. Final conclusions reveal that, according to the extreme events expected, location and composition of Urban Green Spaces is key in the adaptive strategy of cities facing climate change.",0.08335744539422756,0.35909502284058553,0.10075373561036731,0.19969395563754458,0.061203431567752244,0.7726904803670555,0.0957469332405039
"Values, Bias, and Stressors Affect Intentions to Adapt to Coastal Flood Risk: A Case Study from New York City","Sea level rise amplifies flooding from tides and storms for coastal communities around the globe. Although the characterization of these physical hazards has improved, it is people's behavior that will ultimately determine the impact on communities. This study adds to our understanding of how people may respond to various adaptation options and policies, using a household survey in New York City, New York, neighborhoods affected by Hurricane Sandy. We investigate previously overlooked factors that may influence intended household adaptive behavior, such as single-action bias, a cognitive trade-off that households make between adaptation options, whereby taking a small (and often less effective measure) may strongly discourage uptake of a more protective measure. Through a novel application of discrete choice experiments in the coastal adaptation context, we simulate plausible future conditions to assess potential adaptation under climatic and nonclimatic stressors. Our findings suggest that single-action bias plays a substantial role in intended coastal adaptation, whereby the odds of homeowners who have already implemented a modest-cost measure to insure and relocate in the future are 66% and 80% lower, respectively. The odds of homeowners to relocate are also similar to 1.9, similar to 2.2, and similar to 3.1 times as great if their peers relocate, nuisance flooding becomes a frequent occurrence, and property values fall substantially, respectively. We find that renters' motivation to relocate is largely driven more by external issues such as crime, gentrification, and economic security than by flood hazard.",0.28851619931943917,0.383543268951553,0.11038925576586187,0.25483099727830855,0.2433619079530044,0.38511494037645977,0.16268803989210268

The strategies and effectiveness of climate adaptation for the thousand pillars dwelling based on passive elements and passive spaces,"Relying on passive climate-responsive strategies, traditional dwellings can effectively control the indoor thermo-hygrometric and daylighting conditions by taking advantage of some favorable climatic elements like wind, solar radiation, etc. Furthermore, the building's elements and spaces can be regulated to make the indoor microclimate reach the comfort limits thanks to these passive strategies. In this paper, the Thousand Pillars Dwelling (TPD) is taken as a research objective to explore its climate adaptation strategies and effectiveness for the local climate in the view of passive elements (PEs) and passive spaces (PSs). By the methodologies of literature reviews, field investigations and software simulations, the buffer effect (BE) created by PEs (composed of doors, windows, walls etc.) and PSs (composed of patios, corridors etc.) contributing to the improvement of indoor comfort level (ICL) is researched qualitatively. An additional study on in-situ measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and illuminance in diverse parts of TPD was carried out to research their effectiveness of climate adaptation quantitatively. This study shows that BEs are effective at mitigating the impact of outdoor climate on internal spaces, which is helpful for the extension of indoor comfort time (EICT) by 3472 h per year. The research results of passive strategies are summarized from the study case of TPD and its effectiveness of climate adaptation can provide some methods and implications to create more comfortable indoor environments for rural residences.

The adaptiveness of law put to the test: Dealing with water scarcity in a water-rich country,"Arguably law should change and become adaptive in order to facilitate adaptation to climate change. However, adaptiveness is not the only feature of law. Too much flexibility runs counter to the need for stability, enforceability and legitimacy. Therefore a balance should be struck. Legal experiments could open up the discussion about the need for and the extent of legal adaptation to climate change. This need for experiments motivated our choice to analyze and compare two adaptation measures to deal with water scarcity in a water-rich country like the Netherlands from a resilience perspective. Our aim was to uncover whether the current Dutch legal framework enables adaptation or whether that requires a rule change. We analyzed the applicable legal rules, the legal and policy documents and selected two case studies in an area with structural water scarcity. We interviewed the main stakeholders, which set up adaptation measures. It is clear that the Dutch legal system is not designed to deal with structural water scarcity. Yet the two cases showed that the national rules did not have to change to enable adaptation to a situation of structural water scarcity. Albeit Dutch water resource law does not equally promote all elements of an adaptive approach, it enables adaptation through its polycentric structure and the discretionary room it leaves to regional authorities to create local solutions together with private parties.",0.3952526115906671,0.3026580974175342,0.15487626799312468,0.22822530210690967,0.10863165555043709,0.1114421735016517,0.7765856634425237

Evaluating climate change adaptation strategies and scenarios of enhanced vertical and horizontal compactness at urban scale (a case study for Berlin),"This study evaluates the effectiveness of climate change adaptation strategies in Berlin, Germany, on a summer day by using the urban climate model MUKLIMO_3. White coating, green roofs and a combination of both are analysed regarding their cooling ability on the 2 m-temperature. Additionally, horizontal and vertical compactness are evaluated in terms of their respective impact on the micro climate. An enhanced albedo of the urban surfaces leads to the highest cooling ability with a significant daily average cooling of 0.2 K per 0.1 increase of albedo, while green roofs have only a small cooling effect at pedestrian level. An increased vertical compactness has a cooling ability due to the higher amount of shading, enhanced horizontal compactness shows a negative impact on the micro climate due to the raised percentage of sealed surfaces and the additional urban structures that can emit additional heat during the night. All strategies show a higher effect on the daytime and a smaller influence on the nocturnal temperature.",0.34360778406273473,0.30690513483391585,0.06193875829370917,0.28574641646423127,0.03485830757092196,0.3035526777920768,0.0714463327053445
Climate change adaptation support tools in Australia,"A variety of climate change adaptation support tools (CCASTs) have become available to support adaptation, but there is limited information about the types of tools available, their aims or their effectiveness. We reviewed the CCASTs currently in use, or in development, in Australia in order to identify those most used, the areas covered and the key knowledge gaps where development of new support tools is required. To ascertain the effectiveness of the CCASTs, we contacted CCAST developers/owners and logged evidence of uptake and/or evaluations already produced. We identified a total of 85 CCASTs, 65 in Australia and 20 selected international examples. Over half of the support tools identified in Australia were found to be associated with the infrastructure and planning and local government sectors. Biodiversity and business sectors offered the fewest CCASTs, 3 and 2 %, respectively. The majority of Australian CCASTs were developed at State and local government levels, presumably because adaptation tools are most applicable at local scales. Interestingly, the number of CCASTs showed a marked increase from 2007 onwards, with approximately 30 % of those recorded being currently in development. In Australia, the prevalent adaptation activity, and CCAST type, presently taking place is the identification and assessment of climate change risks. Knowledge gaps identified were for support tools providing guidance on: costing and prioritising adaptation options, evaluating and monitoring adaptation measures, conducting vulnerability assessments, facilitating adaptation for vulnerable species and ecosystems. Most organisations are at the early stages of adaptation: assessing climate risks and beginning to formulate adaptation options.",0.2615303965486532,0.36242378817109816,0.13515628030069543,0.20469590134434226,0.10988803022191074,0.16569688242550407,0.10983786212179238

The present paper utilises advanced stochastic simulation methods to examine climate change impacts, and possible climate change adaptation strategies, for Australian power distribution networks. The assessment framework developed, which is applicable to a wide variety of infrastructure types and research areas, utilises probabilistic methods to investigate the appropriateness of climate adaptation strategies aimed at ameliorating the impact of climate change on critical infrastructure. Measures investigated include alterations to design or maintenance practices through, for example, installation of larger poles, more frequent inspections, or changes to pole replacement criteria. A cost-benefit decision analysis is developed herein using the latest AR5 climate projections, network vulnerability, adaptation measures, and cost and loss data for both direct and indirect costs. The net present value and benefit-to-cost ratio is calculated for different adaptation strategies over the life cycle of the assets up to the year 2090. An adaptation measure that allows for the installation of larger poles but less stringent pole replacement criteria has the highest net benefit-with a mean potential saving of hundreds of millions of dollars.",0.5,0.2949999359719096,0.11101097050381716,0.36566150257359814,0.07121157365277819,0.13976005532863975,0.06967462291375807
American adaptation: Social factors affecting new developments to address climate change,"Climate change and extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in the United States. The social factors that drive cities to adapt to and/or prepare for these impacts are largely unknown. Sixty-five qualitative interviews were conducted with multi-sectoral decision-makers to assess factors driving adaptation in six cities across the United States: Tucson, Arizona; Tampa, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Boston, Massachusetts; Portland, Oregon; and Los Angeles, California. We find that there are three type of factors that affect adaptation: (1) swing characteristics of or events within localities that can lead toward or away from action; (2) inhibitors ways of thinking and framing climate change available to decision-makers that slow, but do not necessarily stop change; and (3) resource catalysts types of information and moral grounding that provide a rationale for change. These factors often intersect such that swing factors are only influential in cities with some political acceptance of climate change. In cities where public acceptance of climate change is slowly shifting, resource catalysts are more influential. This is the first qualitative study of climate change adaptation in American cities.

Capacities of private developers in urban climate change adaptation,"Anthropogenic climate change has the potential to severely impact the natural and human environment. The urban environment is particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change because of a range of geographic and social factors. This chapter aims to investigate the institutional capacity of the private urban development sector in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia to respond to the task of climate change adaptation and, in turn, investigate the role of private financial institutions in funding climate adaptive urban development. The project methodology included a desktop literature review, an online questionnaire survey and a series of semi-structured interviews and focus groups held with members of the SEQ development sector that included developers, consultants, state and local government staff, architects, solicitors, planners and financiers. Larger developers tended to have more capacity to include climate adaptive features in their developments. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Bottom-up initiatives toward climate change adaptation in cases in the Netherlands and the UK: a complexity leadership perspective,"Climate change will result in large challenges that require societies to adapt to and manage increased risks. Regional practices of climate adaptation often take shape within multilevel governance networks in which representatives of different levels of government, policy sectors, public and private parties may discuss and negotiate potential measures. This paper aims to explore the role of leadership in enhancing the adaptive capacity of multilevel governance networks and in supporting regional practices of climate adaptation. The paper reviews two initiatives toward climate adaptation, the WaalWeelde initiative in the Netherlands and the Manhood Peninsula Partnership in the UK, based on policy documentation and analysis of in total 17 semistructured interviews with public and private actors. The study illustrates both the large differences in organization of water management, spatial planning, and flood risk policies, as well as strong similarities in the way in which leadership may contribute to the development of initiatives.",0.20106224783322865,0.37141477431342856,0.17656574863034255,0.16174905431781653,0.11058865049278041,0.2698640678789336,0.26280267724630835
Climate friendly urban green areas: Roadside green spaces in Sakarya/Turkey,"The role of urban green areas to adapt climate change impacts has been emphasized globally as urbanization is a very common fact around the world. This issue has been addressed by the sustainable development goals, several studies also underlined that sustainable urban planning is a crucial issue to enable more livable cities. The most natural and sustainable solution is to benefit green spaces with specific landscape design approaches including xeriscape. In this study we focus on roadside green spaces in an industrialized city. Traffic islands have been assessed based on the share of hardscape and green parts together with plant species and their irrigation specifications. The irrigation requirements have been analyzed by using a potential evapotranspiration method which is Blaney Criddle equation. The need for irrigation and the influence of the roadside green spaces as an adaptation tool emerge as a controversial situation in case of low water resources. We analyzed water needs of current plantation and irrigation systems and came out with a conclusion that xeriscape practices like mulching, use of xeric plants and grey water has a good potential to optimize water usage, mitigate urban heat island effect and support adaptation to the climate change. © 2018, International University of Sarajevo.",0.2805048665236461,0.30397089949251277,0.1287603318755607,0.22155518763753568,0.058784867815507,0.5,0.2570162482871264
Climate Change Vulnerability and Adaptation in Metro Manila Challenging Governance and Human Security of Urban Poor Communities,"Climate change and flooding in Asian cities pose great challenges to the environmental and human security of the population and their governance systems. This paper examines the intersections of ecological-environmental and social vulnerability and the adaptive responses of urban poor communities and commercial-industrial establishments in Metro Manila to floods and other climate change-related effects, such as storm surges and sea-level rise (SLR). These weaken the communities' ecological-environmental systems, threaten the well-being and security of the people and strain the resources of city governments. Disaggregating the ecological-environment vulnerabilities of a city/community according to specific places/spaces (or place-based vulnerabilities) that lead also to variable patterns among different groups (e.g., gender, income group, sector) of adaptive responses to flooding. Drawing a systematic sample of urban poor households and industrial-commercial establishments along the Pasig-Marikina River Basin of Metro Manila, this study utilised household surveys, key informant interviews, focus group discussions (FGD) and secondary data sources, in analysing the sources of their vulnerability and adaptive responses. Existing studies generally focus on the vulnerability and adaptation of urban-rural populations and do not highlight the interaction of place-based vulnerabilities with sector-specific vulnerabilities that reconfigure flood impacts and responses among the urban poor communities and commercial-industrial establishments during and after floods. In particular, poor and female-headed households residing in highly degraded environments or places/spaces within and across urban poor communities suffered higher damages and losses compared to better-off households and establishments. The interaction of these drivers of vulnerability further heightens and compromises the environmental and human security needs of poor people, their communities and those in the private sector that local/national government agencies need to respond.",0.24410863061119562,0.4819159363222798,0.13546433519113776,0.4389388014581188,0.15800535722084885,0.40875437354759375,0.1842361578697981

Learning from one another: evaluating the impact of horizontal knowledge exchange for environmental management and governance,"There is increasing advocacy for inclusive community-based approaches to environmental management, and growing evidence that involving communities improves the sustainability of social-ecological systems. Most community-based approaches rely on partnerships and knowledge exchange between communities, civil society organizations, and professionals such as practitioners and/or scientists. However, few models have actively integrated more horizontal knowledge exchange from community to community. We reflect on the transferability of community owned solutions between indigenous communities by exploring challenges and achievements of community peer-to-peer knowledge exchange as a way of empowering communities to face up to local environmental and social challenges. Using participatory visual methods, indigenous communities of the North Rupununi (Guyana) identified and documented their community owned solutions through films and photostories. Indigenous researchers from this community then shared their solutions with six other communities that faced similar challenges within Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, and Brazil. They were supported by in-country civil society organizations and academics. We analyzed the impact of the knowledge exchange through interviews, field reports, and observations. Our results show that indigenous community members were significantly more receptive to solutions emerging from, and communicated by, other indigenous peoples, and that this approach was a significant motivating force for galvanizing communities to make changes in their community. We identified a range of enabling factors, such as building capacity for a shared conceptual and technical understanding, that strengthens the exchange between communities and contributes to a lasting impact. With national and international policy-makers mobilizing significant financial resources for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, we argue that the promotion of community owned solutions through community peer-to-peer exchange may deliver more long-lasting, socially and ecologically integrated, and investment-effective strategies compared to top-down, expert led, and/or foreign-led initiatives.",0.5,0.5412925383273819,0.2142994314241461,0.441449847589253,0.17000590808606483,0.056899351592264454,0.14757252083380148
Value of traditional oral narratives in building climate-change resilience: insights from rural communities in Fiji,"In the interests of improving engagement with Pacific Island communities to enable development of effective and sustainable adaptation strategies to climate change, we looked at how traditional oral narratives in rural/peripheral Fiji communities might be used to inform such strategies. Interviews were undertaken and observations made in 27 communities; because the custodians of traditional knowledge were targeted, most interviewees were 70-79 years old. The view that oral traditions, particularly those referring to environmental history and the observations/precursors of environmental change, were endangered was widespread and regretted. Interviewees' personal experiences of extreme events (natural disasters) were commonplace but no narratives of historical (unwitnessed by interviewees) events were found. In contrast, experiences of previous village relocations attributable (mainly) to environmental change were recorded in five communities while awareness of environmentally driven migration was more common. Questions about climate change elicited views dominated by religious/fatalist beliefs but included some more pragmatic ones; the confusion of climate change with climate variability, which is part of traditional knowledge, was widespread. The erosion of traditional environmental knowledge in the survey communities over recent decades has been severe and is likely to continue apace, which will reduce community self-sufficiency and resilience. Ways of conserving such knowledge and incorporating it into adaptation planning for Pacific Island communities in rural/peripheral locations should be explored.",0.5239239829315381,0.5,0.10892730622748728,0.4240417978040904,0.23950179119615403,0.05148608706240606,0.1496322886201603
Gendered adaptations to climate change: A case study from the Philippines,"Over recent decades, climate change has rapidly become a serious threat to human society and well being. One of the key identified effects of changing climate is the expected increase in flooding events. Flooding, brought about by heavy rainfall and frequent typhoons, is predicted to increase in a climate change prone country like the Philippines. As a country which often experiences climate-related disasters, men and women have developed adaptation strategies that make them resilient to extreme weather events. Using gender-sensitive qualitative methods, this study shows the gendered adaptation to flooding in rice farming communities in Nueva, Ecija Philippines. Based on the initial results of the study, men and women adapt to flooding according to their traditional roles.Moreover, due to changing weather patterns which greatly affect their livelihoods, men and women have assumed new roles. This alteration of gender roles has significant impacts on men and women farmers and on the welfare of their households. This study highlights the importance of understanding the gendered adaptation strategies and their consequences that can provide a basis for designing long term strategies for adaptations to climate variability. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.",0.7171649693075566,0.3230312277110759,0.08646965656196354,0.5259570102598735,0.05997065434226336,0.03621050305363194,0.13524557076939775
Early alert and community involvement: approach for disaster risk reduction in Rwanda,"Natural disasters' socioeconomic and environmental losses are predicted to rise, unless early warning, full stakeholders and community involvement in the mitigation, adaptation and risk reduction are squarely engaged. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of early alert and community involvement in disaster risk reduction in Nyabihu District, Western Rwanda. A quota sampling method was employed to obtain a sample of 240 households from 12 sectors of Nyabihu District in 2015. A structured questionnaire was used, and the field data collected were computed by using SPSS16.0 for Windows. The results indicated that, as stated by respondents, the frequently experienced disasters are floods (51.25%) and landslides (42.08%). However, as asserted by 68% of informants, disaster-related information is communicated through radio channels after the occurrence, while 29% of them declared that disaster information is disseminated before occurrence, which implies the rising level of risk vulnerability and incidences to the community due to lack of early warning. A lower community participation in disaster risk preparedness and mitigation was noticed (6.2%) while 31.6% mentioned taking part in activities aimed at coping with the aftermath (adaptation). Moreover, disaster risk reduction government policies are preferentially implemented (42.9%) other than considering the community's knowledge (14.1%). To halt the gradual increase in disasters' associated risks and losses, it is suggested to introduce disaster-related training across the community, introduce disaster courses from elementary schools and integrate the community in decision-making process.",0.28383899746446367,0.40958423383779097,0.13910809975387495,0.32162493447286755,0.27224911698914367,0.07896277875813829,0.40126778326483264
"A review on extreme weather events and livelihood in Odisha, India","Over the years extreme weather events have been catastrophic and continue to have overwhelming impacts globally, mainly due to climate change. However, the impacts of extreme weather events have been uneven and devastating in developing countries largely because of lack of resources, weak adaptive capacity and large dependency on climate sensitive livelihoods. Odisha on the eastern coast of India is one of the most disaster-prone states in India with a regular prevalence of extreme events like cyclones, droughts, floods and Heat waves. The state's livelihood is mainly based on weather patterns directly (farming, fisheries) or indirectly (non-farm wage labour, dairy farming) are at stake due to the frequent occurrence of extreme weather events. However, there are very limited studies available which describe the situation, impacts and resilience of extreme weather events in the context of livelihood in the state. The present study is an attempt in this direction to review and examine the impact of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclone, flood, drought and Heat wave) on the livelihood of the population in Odisha. In addition, the study examines the resilience shown by the people and the program and policy adopted by the government on the extreme weather events in the state. The study findings highlight that extreme weather events have affected populations at large, caused substantial economic losses and exerted a disproportionate effect on the vulnerable social groups such as sharecroppers, small and marginal farmers, backward communities, landless labourers, wage labourers, rickshaw pullers and vendors as the nature of work in which they are engaged is susceptible to the effects of extreme weather events. Heat waves, droughts, floods and cyclones are the important extreme weather events that hamper the livelihoods in Odisha. Frequent occurrence of events has caused a blow to the livelihood resilience of the poor and marginalized people. While immediate coping mechanisms at the local level do provide some relief to the people, but the ability of people to adapt to these disasters is severely affected by the increased frequency of these disasters and there is a dire need to focus towards more sustainable and long-term livelihood solutions.",0.45051017164695994,0.39656352791043264,0.06148806722309406,0.3748634083996705,0.06122436693059788,0.1078211234660791,0.19570384979926905
"Adaptive governance in the developing world: disaster risk reduction in the State of Odisha, India","Under what conditions do governments turn to adaptive governance systems? This paper explores a success case of adaptive governance in a non-western country and tries to understand what factors lead to the adoption of this type of governance. Adaptive governance is considered most efficient to address the many challenges of climate change and natural disasters because it embraces uncertainty by focusing on collaboration, flexibility and learning. Yet, the concept remains underdeveloped and the conditions under which governments decide to embrace adaptive governance are not clear. The paper argues that two main factors are crucial for governments to turn to adaptive governance. First, a traumatic shock is likely to stimulate a reconsideration of the manner in which governance is thought and applied. The shock by involving considerable economic and human cost creates a momentum for governance rethinking. Second, a committed political leadership is essential to make use of that momentum to reform previous governance practices to create a more resilient system. These arguments are explored in the case of Odisha, an Indian state that was able to adopt adaptive governance and that became a successful example of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.",0.2857088395704151,0.34084236275043045,0.16613250350340722,0.2865350770647571,0.13306824348511667,0.21383318510085478,0.48038102814734834
Determinants of Climate Change Adaptive Behavior in Coastal Communities in Southeast Asia,"This study sought to understand the determinants of autonomous adaptation of households in coastal communities in three countries (Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam) as regards climate change. The study's main innovation is its focus on households facing a confluence of related hazards, a context that is unique to coastal communities. The study tackled the interrelated hazards of coastal erosion, flooding, and saltwater intrusion, and used a multivariate probit model to analyze the determinants. Regression results show that households adapt or respond autonomously to a combination of hazards. In fact, the econometric model of joint decision cannot be rejected by the data. Geographical differences were observed in adaptation patterns, implying that households react rationally to the degree of threats from the hazards. Like in some literature, the study found evidence that planned adaptation may crowd out private or autonomous adaptation. Likewise, trust increases the likelihood of self-insurance and self-protection, especially against extreme events that are either recurring or permanent. Finally, the households' adaptive capacity depends partly on the type of hazard and has a gender dimension. In recurrent extreme events, the abundance of male labor increases the likelihood of adaptation. In permanent and creeping hazards such as saltwater intrusion, the abundance of female labor increases the likelihood of adaptation.",0.5510379936972859,0.3512455259549637,0.07172223000770413,0.4660108587788405,0.2883040194124251,0.14243742886708574,0.14920617873186118
Indigenous social and economic adaptations in northern Alaska as measures of resilience,"I explored one aspect of social-ecological change in the context of an Alaskan human-Rangifer system, with the goal of understanding household adaptive responses to perturbations when there are multiple forces of change at play. I focused on households as one element of social resilience. Resilience is in the context of transition theory, in which communities are continually in a process of change, and perturbations are key points in the transition process. This case study of Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska, USA, contributes to the understanding of cultural continuity and household resilience in times of rapid change by using household survey data from 1978 to 2003 to understand how households adapted to changes in the cash economy that came with oil development at the same time as a crash in the caribou population and state-imposed limits on caribou harvests. The research illustrates that households are resilient in the way they capture opportunities and create a new system so that elements of the old remain while parts change.",0.4467425832576936,0.40766964970828906,0.1457177971978385,0.4738250771371065,0.09578125503042291,0.0715251363609011,0.10548038053529296
Adaptation to climate change as resilience for urban extreme poor: lessons learned from targeted asset transfers programmes in Dhaka city of Bangladesh,"This paper aims to identify how targeted asset transfers help to build adaptive capacity and adaptive actions of the urban extreme poor to climate change phenomena. This paper explores the theoretical debates of community-based adaptation approach and failure of such approach to address urban extreme poor. The empirical evidence of these theoretical debates will be drawn from two informal settlements of Dhaka city, where a targeted asset transfer project has been implementing since 2009. This paper explains that urban extreme poor usually work as unskilled labour and lack different livelihood capitals; and climate change is an increasingly important influence exacerbating an already vulnerable livelihood context. There is growing recognition in the literature that poor urban people and communities are adapting to climate change in physical and behavioural terms. But, in the case of urban extreme poor these adaptation approaches are delivering short-term survival strategies disregarding the notion of wellbeing in the medium to long-term perspectives. It is also evident that community level initiatives structurally reproduce the exclusion of the urban extreme poor. However, poverty literatures acknowledge that poverty-centred approaches could help to reduce vulnerability. As urban extreme poor are significantly more resource constrained, it is reasonable to assert that targeted asset transfers could be a poverty-centred adaptation approach in a changing climate. Targeted asset transfers approaches are the outcomes of recent social protection revolution that especially consider accumulation of physical, financial, human, and social capital in order to build adaptive capacity of the urban extreme poor. This adaptive capacity of the extreme poor may facilitate adjustments in assets, livelihoods, behaviours, and technologies in order to reduce future climate vulnerability. In this context, this paper seeks to answer whether targeted asset transfer approaches can be considered as effective poverty-centred adaptation approaches for the urban extreme poor or not.",0.2161522140556249,0.4222226141762006,0.11532117296283077,0.39365058944936904,0.07331535513922184,0.44037773096377325,0.17095566495862294
Adapting traditional livelihood practices in the face of environmental disruptions in subsistence communities,"This paper explores the impact of environmental disruptions on traditional livelihood practices in subsistence communities. Our research was conducted in a South Indian fishing community, which has faced several environmental disruptions over the last two decades. Our findings illustrate how environmental disruptions threaten livelihood security and bring into question the legitimacy of traditional livelihood practices. In the face of livelihood insecurity, the community legitimizes adaptations to traditional livelihood practices to reestablish livelihood security. We find evidence of three types of adaptations to traditional livelihood practices: (1) blending traditional livelihood practices with non-traditional livelihood practices, (2) expanding beyond the domain of traditional livelihood practices, and (3) altering the knowledge base underlying livelihood practices. Our findings also illustrate how various types of legitimacy push against each other during the change process and how the community resolves these tensions.",0.871471703866194,0.3584479234403878,0.1582194860899256,0.5653640105468025,0.06820014139556733,0.02913636809405304,0.10732667642804358
"Differentiated livelihoods, local institutions, and the adaptation imperative: Assessing climate change adaptation policy in Tanzania","This paper interrogates the framings and priorities of adaptation in Tanzania's climate policy and examines the implications for the role of local institutions and differentiated rural populations in climate change adaptation. Although Tanzania lacks a ""stand alone"" climate policy, Tanzania's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) and National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) provide the most comprehensive statements of the central government's framing of adaptation and its priorities with regard to adaptation. In assessing discursive framings of adaptation, we find that the dominant policy discourse constructs an anti-politics of adaptation through its framing of climate change as an urgent and generalized threat to development while failing sufficiently to address the complex governance and social equity dimensions of climate change adaptation. The technocratic prescriptions of Tanzania's NAPA and NCSS converge with similar prescriptions found in Tanzania's national development policies, such as the major agricultural development initiative Kilimo Kwanza. Adaptation challenges identified by communities in Mwanga District demonstrate complex local institutional and resource tenure questions that are not addressed in climate policy but which require policy attention if social equity in climate change adaptation is to be achieved.

Learning from disaster: community-based marine protected areas in Fiji,"This paper examines whether and how experiencing climate-related disasters can improve the rural poor's adaptation to climate change through community-based resource management. Original household survey data in Fiji capture the establishment of community-based marine protected areas following a tropical cyclone. Controlling for the endogeneity of household-level cyclone damage reveals that a household's exposure to the disaster increases its support for establishing marine protected areas, presumably for future safety nets. Evidence suggests that community members' social learning from disaster experience might facilitate their consensual decision making.",0.31717384408636556,0.40971791433665156,0.15467739219389245,0.46239789557700756,0.1812736308052954,0.08008492798256817,0.19633668199423263
"Adapting to the Inevitable: The Case of Tanbi Wetland National Park, The Gambia","The role of human activities in degradation of estuarine resources has been well documented. Besides the effects of climate change, activities such as clearing of mangroves for tourism, use of inappropriate fishing gear and excessive use of pesticides for agricultural productivity are the most powerful ecological stressors. In the Sahelian climate zone, hydrological regimes are changing due to reduced river flow and increase in atmospheric temperatures leading to the formation of inverse estuaries. The evaluation and documentation of local adaptation practices is one way to prevent “conservation bottlenecks” and encourage sustainable use of estuarine resources. This study used a questionnaire-based approach to evaluate local adaptation strategies to climate-induced ecological changes in the Tanbi Wetland National Park (TWNP) over the past three decades, targeting the communities that are engaged in the four major socio-economic sectors in the wetland i.e. Fishing, Agriculture, Oyster collection and Tourism. The agricultural zone presented the best local adaptation techniques employed as a response to ecosystem changes in the TWNP (23.53 %), followed by tourism zones (7.35 %) and fishing (5.88 %). With the disappearance of many fish species within the same timeframe, this leaves much to be desired. Bearing in mind that fisheries and tourism are the second and third largest contributors to the Gambia’s GDP, this paper provides useful recommendations for management of this important wetland. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",0.6878904907902936,0.32345449077864646,0.1670147479507236,0.5174433246802385,0.12299263637071585,0.03475772142600904,0.060235222585883756
"Understanding adaptation: Lessons from local adaptive measures to coastal risks and hazards – A case study of kukup water village, Malaysia","Globally, rising sea levels could have the most significant impact on developing countries, which have limited adaptive capacity to face the challenges of climate change. Through a case study of Kukup water village in Malaysia, this study seeks to understand the influence of coastal risks and hazards on coastal settlements’ spatial development, local construction measures for the adaptation of the coastal environment, and the implication of local adaptive measures on environmental policy and coastal management. The study used historical records and qualitative semi-structured interviews for data collection, and presented the spatial development and construction measures using an open-access 3D modelling tool, “SketchUp”. The study finds that natural, socioeconomic and cultural factors have contributed to the adjustment of spatial arrangement and that local adaptive measures reflect the local perception of coastal risks and hazards. More research is needed to understand the effects of cultural factors on adaptive capacity and how cultural aspects of adaptation can contribute to the improvement of adaptive capacity that is sensitive to different social context. © 2019, University of Malaya.

Adaptation strategies to climate change in the tourist sector: The case of coastal tourism in Spain,"Tourism activities, that are very important in the Spanish Mediterranean coast since 60s, have been described as highly vulnerable to climate change. Diversification of the tourism and tourist products are often presented as a possible strategy for adapting to the effects of climate change. The present study explores the initiatives in product diversification that are being put into practice in the Spanish Mediterranean coastal tourism sector. To this end, the study focuses on the analysis of the experiences of the rural tourism sector as an alternative tosun-and-sand tourism in the Alt Emporda (Costa Brava, North-eastern Spain). Methodology of this research is based in two aspects: a) desk research of relevant public documents aimed to promote the diversification of the tourist sector; b) regional survey of rural tourism establishments. The analysis reveals a process of diversification that is characterised by spontaneous developments that lack planning and shows an absence of product structuring in accordance with a segmentation of the market. Given these characteristics, the process of diversification that has taken place will not contribute to increasing adaptation's capacity of tourism to climate change or, consequently, to reducing its level of vulnerability.",0.21888187259980005,0.3747396789658411,0.15341149071573842,0.4005789105235352,0.20719528593585915,0.08184518650421072,0.06141659468329918
From cattle to camels: trajectories of livelihood adaptation and social-ecological resilience in a Kenyan pastoralist community,"In drylands across the globe, natural resource-dependent societies are experiencing rapid rates of environmental change as well as transforming social, economic, and political contexts. When novel adaptation strategies are adopted in response to changing climatic and environmental conditions, outcomes are often contingent on individual households' adaptive capacities as well as broader environmental, social, economic, and political contexts. Understanding the heterogeneous and context-dependent outcomes of adaptation strategies is critical information for dryland sustainability policy, and is a burgeoning focus in climate adaptation science. We evaluated the 30-year process of novel adoption of camel husbandry by a group of Kenyan pastoralists, using a five-stage analytical approach that disaggregated dynamics in three ways: at the level of each individual who adopted camel husbandry; at the processual level by distinguishing assets that influenced decision-making, enactment, and streams of livelihood benefits; and at the temporal level by assessing changes in broader social-ecological contexts that occurred over the 30-year period. Our study revealed that adaptation unfolded as a heterogeneous, multi-phase process, contingent on individuals' different sources of adaptive capacity utilized at different junctures in their adaptation experience, as well as on temporal shifts in the broader social-ecological context. Synthesizing the findings using a multi-dimensional vulnerability framework, we concluded that because of inequality in access to assets among households and a concomitant weakening of social norms of reciprocity and social cohesion, the livelihood adaptation is generating contradictory effects on household-level and community-level resilience.",0.45098151321581414,0.41777290967496994,0.16806082398749625,0.5440486007455702,0.13858186819910778,0.07291370960073394,0.07637792913549281
"Dry lands households' responses as a continuum of on and off farm strategies: Insights from Chivi, Zimbabwe","In this chapter, we aim to investigate how local communities cope with and adapt to multiple stresses in rural Zimbabwe. In semiarid regions, water scarcity is one of a number of stresses that shape livelihood vulnerability. With climate change, it is predicted that rainfall in Zimbabwe will become more uncertain and variable in the future, exposing more people to water insecurity. At the same time, the impacts of disease, a lack of institutional capacity, and limited livelihood opportunities can combine to limit adaptive capacity. Therefore, adaptation to changing climate should not be viewed in isolation but, instead, in the context of social, economic, and political conditions, all of which shape local community vulnerability and people's ability to cope with and adapt to change. This study uses a qualitative-quantitativequalitative framework, including the use of a stated preference survey, to identify the drivers of agroecosystem change, to understand the capacity of households to cope with droughts, and to determine the ability of local institutions to respond to crises. The analysis suggests that the capacity of the agroecosystem to remain productive during droughts is decreasing, individual/household adaptive capacity remains low, and institutional capacity faces considerable barriers that prevent it from supporting households to adapt to multiple stresses. This research adds weight to the claim that vulnerability reflects multiple forces and processes, and that multiple stresses, that are agroecological, socioeconomic, and institutional in nature, need to be examined in order to understand vulnerability and to prevent maladaptation. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",0.6262763244369044,0.3615943878771035,0.13496332089747956,0.5075316738177508,0.0671487764515526,0.052373286957788645,0.25993366183399697
Integration of Indigenous and Scientific Knowledge in Disaster Risk Reduction: Resilience Building of a Marginalized Sampaguita Growing Community in the Philippines,A constructivist research methodology elucidated the evolved layers of risks in a sampaguita growing community in the Philippines. Integration of indigenous and scientific knowledge was a crucial process in livelihood disaster risk reduction and resilience building. Resilience processes empowered the marginalized community to escape chronic poverty and collectively act on other constraints including climate change-related risks. The resilience process of collective adaptation was a capability manifestation of making a choice to develop livelihood capitals in the face of disaster risks in a manner that does not degrade the natural resource base of the valued sampaguita livelihood. © 2018 The Authors.

"The Role of Microfinance in Household Livelihood Adaptation in Satkhira District, Southwest Bangladesh","There is increasing interest in the potential of microfinance to foster climate change adaptation. However, existing literature over-relies upon theoretical arguments rather than empirical evidence, and until now the emphasis has been on potential positive linkages. We address these weaknesses by empirically examining the role of microfinance in adaptation, drawing from household-level quantitative and qualitative data gathered from Satkhira District, Southwest Bangladesh. We find evidence that microfinance facilitates coping by reducing sensitivity to environmental and climate hazards. Credit is especially important because its availability is uncorrelated with the occurrence of flooding, unlike many other traditional coping responses. We also find evidence that microfinance facilitates adaptation by helping households to overcome financial barriers of adopting adaptation options which reduce exposure or sensitivity. However, credit limits are likely to restrict its role to incremental adaptations, which may not meaningfully reduce vulnerability. Transformational adaptations at times required access to bank credit which the poorest cannot access. This restricts their ability to effectively adapt and are penalized financially by having to obtain loans to cope. We also find evidence that microfinance can lead to maladaptation when used in non-profit generating activities as income streams are not produced to help repay associated costs. Almost a fifth of all loans were obtained for repaying existing loans. Thus microfinance may undermine longer term adaptive capacity. (C) 2016 The Authors.

ADAPTING IN THE SHADOW OF ANNAPURNA: A CLIMATE TIPPING POINT,"Rapid climate change in the Himalaya threatens the traditional livelihoods of remote mountain communities, challenges traditional systems of knowledge, and stresses existing socio-ecological systems. Through semi-structured interviews, participatory photography, and repeat photography focused on climate change and its impacts on traditional livelihoods, we aim to shed light on some of the socio-cultural implications of climate related change in Manang, a remote village in the Annapurna Conservation Area of Western Nepal. Observed changes in temperature, precipitation, permanent snow cover, and glacial extent directly inform villagers' perceptions of and adaptations to Himalayan climate change. Adaptation strategies include a shift from traditional agropastoral practices to a more diversified blend of agropastoralism, tourism services, and cash-crop production. Climate change has tipped the scales in favor of the production of fruits and vegetables, cash crops previously unsuitable to the local climate. Diversification of livelihood strategies signifies transformation within the socio-ecological system of Manang and may enable greater resiliency to long-term climatic change. Continued development of relevant, place-based adaptations to rapid Himalayan climate change depends on local peoples' ability to understand the potential impacts of climate change and to adjust within complex, traditional socio-ecological systems.",0.8139098086430739,0.3353462803262481,0.18869463894496344,0.47245014737343916,0.07134567443773533,0.018882768096033235,0.0561417517865807
Gender-sensitive adaptation policy-making in Bangladesh: status and ways forward for improved mainstreaming,"Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change such as flooding, cyclones and drought. Women in Bangladesh are disproportionately affected by these impacts due to the nature of their livelihoods, their social obligations and confines, and their unique nutritional and health requirements, particularly during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Climate change policy in Bangladesh seeks to replicate adaptation policies under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This paper will briefly review the policy response to climate change in Bangladesh. As climate adaptation requires a multi-sectoral response, relevant policy concerned with climate, adaptation, poverty, gender and health will be studied. This assessment will determine whether gender issues related to adaptation are addressed in key policy pieces in Bangladesh. Key interventions related to climate change will also be assessed to determine whether gender is integrated in operational activity. Finally, the role of women in the development of adaptation policy will be assessed by outlining their participation in adaptation discourse. Findings indicate that gender-sensitive policies are quite limited. Policies may acknowledge the particular vulnerabilities of women, but operational planning to address these is absent. Whilst some operational responses superficially acknowledge vulnerability and may include women in planning processes, few address the unique impacts of climate change on women.",0.20146844599462543,0.4273027789888252,0.13103314817838793,0.3777415072168598,0.07136825344610388,0.13754053225944013,0.13392277137847258
"Climate change and adaptation of mountain societies in Central Asia: uncertainties, knowledge gaps, and data constraints","Mountain societies in developing and low-income countries are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which can severely threaten their livelihoods. The situation of mountain communities in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountains in Central Asia is exacerbated by remote location, difficult access, and poorly maintained infrastructure as well as by a distinctly continental climate. Designing and implementing climate adaptation policies for mountainous Central Asia is hindered by the limited understanding of a wide range of environmental and socio-ecological parameters. In particular, there are major knowledge gaps on the temperature and precipitation trends in high altitudes of the Pamir and Tien Shan mountains which are the result of poor and frequently unreliable data. These knowledge and date constraints have a negative effect also on forecasting the occurrence and intensity of extreme weather events which constitute a major hazard for local communities residing in the mountain foothills. This study reviews the state of research on climate change and climate change adaptation in mountainous Central Asia, also considering temperature and precipitation projections for the region. This includes an outline of the geophysical and socio-economic conditions of mountainous Central Asia as well as a survey of climate adaptation initiatives and policies currently implemented in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain region with special consideration of their limitations and challenges. Knowledge gaps and data constraints, especially on climate-glacier-water and hazard interactions, are identified, and research and policy measures are suggested based on the study findings for improving climate change adaptation in mountainous Central Asia.",0.5234264035310527,0.3762119500412028,0.14392461010778443,0.34265307766583375,0.08885901838753321,0.08457599484918306,0.10603545312961528
Development Control And Vulnerable Coastal Lands: Examples Of Australian Practice,"A range of regulatory instruments can be used to modify development-control frameworks for the purposes of adapting urban areas to climate change-induced coastal erosion and inundation. This article investigates the approach of three local governments across Australia. It finds that local governments are modifying development-control frameworks to ensure the appropriate development of vulnerable coastal lands.

Strengthening Climate Change Adaptation in Nepal: Needs and Perspectives,"Nepal is one of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, due to its geographical fragility and socio-political circumstances. The effects of climate change are observed across regions, society and villages, mostly impacting the wellbeing of poor and marginalized households. This research explores the existing challenges of managing climate change adaptation in Nepal. The research is based on a case study of three different locations of Nepal, representing different landscapes. The findings show that the impact of climate change differs based on the socio-economic characteristics of households and communities. Poor and marginalized households seem to be more affected by the impacts of climate change than the rich and well off, because of their resource limitations. The findings also show that responses to and management of climate change at the local level are constrained by limited information and knowledge on climate change, inadequate access to technology and services and other governance challenges. The findings imply that local, national, regional and international collaboration is needed, to address the knowledge gap and issues related to financing and technology transfer in Nepal.",0.40055138063200024,0.35487987757926226,0.12590312324520192,0.44486669026953535,0.06584986480853729,0.12117102122674413,0.13307274762288382
"Climate change and adaptation through the lens of capability approach: A case study from Darjeeling, Eastern Himalaya","Climate Change impacts would disproportionately have larger impacts on the developing countries. Both government and development agencies have initiated various adaptation strategies in the developing countries to enhance the adaptation of the local communities. Various policies and programmes have been designed keeping in mind the impact of climate change. This study was conducted in Darjeeling district of West Bengal, India, to see the benefits of such policies and programmes. Focus group discussion with community members were held in the study area. Based on the fieldwork it was seen that most of the intervention made in the study area focused on income, resources, and assets. It has failed to benefits the people due to variation in the capability among various section of the society. Various projects related to health, education, housing, and livelihood, have been implemented in the study region. However, due to lack of conversion factors in the form of gender inequality, discriminatory practices, transparency among others have come as a hindrance in the successful implementation of the projects. Hence, such project-based approach to enhance community's adaptation to climate risk, in the end fails to show benefits as it fails to expand community's capabilities and real freedom, due to the project's pre-defined aims. It is important to understand community's as agent of change rather than merely beneficiaries of adaptation projects. This study therefore recommends that to enhance community's adaptation to climate change, the interventions should be such that it enlarges the range of people's choices so that when climate disaster strikes them they will have a set of opportunities. © 2017 by IGI Global.

"Vulnerability and adaptive capacity of Inuit women to climate change: a case study from Iqaluit, Nunavut","Climate change impacts in the Arctic will be differentiated by gender, yet few empirical studies have investigated how. We use a case study from the Inuit community of Iqaluit, Nunavut, to identify and characterize vulnerability and adaptive capacity of Inuit women to changing climatic conditions. Interviews were conducted with 42 Inuit women and were complimented with focus group discussions and participant observation to examine how women have experienced and responded to changes in climate already observed. Three key traditional activities were identified as being exposed and sensitive to changing conditions: berry picking, sewing, and the amount of time spent on the land. Several coping mechanisms were described to help women manage these exposure sensitivities, such as altering the timing and location of berry picking, and importing seal skins for sewing. The adaptive capacity to employ these mechanisms differed among participants; however, mental health, physical health, traditional/western education, access to country food and store bought foods, access to financial resources, social networks, and connection to Inuit identity emerged as key components of Inuit women's adaptive capacity. The study finds that gender roles result in different pathways through which changing climatic conditions affect people locally, although the broad determinants of vulnerability and adaptive capacity for women are consistent with those identified for men in the scholarship more broadly.",0.5922963315813923,0.4488602132468164,0.1656023059830205,0.5867508774718144,0.08622474712600257,0.03485626688041047,0.08596964886457215
Microhydro electrification and climate change adaptation in Nepal: socioeconomic lessons from the Rural Energy Development Program (REDP),"This article explores the potential for microhydro installations in Nepal to improve adaptive capacity in addition to their ability to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. After explaining its methods of data collection-namely field research and research interviews-the article explores the climate change adaptation benefits of microhydro plants being promoted under the Renewable Energy Development Project (REDP). Besides displacing fossil fuels, in particular kerosene for lighting, microhydro electrification offers an effective way of improving community assets and bolstering social resilience (thereby enhancing the adaptive capacity of communities there). Our own survey of REDP project sites reveals how microhydro units have improved community income levels, equalized gender roles, enhanced access to education and information, and reduced migration patterns.

Widows: agents of change in a climate of water uncertainty,"The African continent has been severely affected by the HIV and AIDS pandemic and as a consequence, development is being obstructed. Agriculture and food production systems are changing as a result of the burden of the pandemic. Many farming families are experiencing trauma from morbidity and mortality as well as facing labour losses and exhaustion. To further exacerbate the situation, climate variability and change reduce the available water supply for domestic and productive uses. This article describes how these multiple stressors play out in Nyanza province in Western Kenya and explores livelihood responses to water stress in Onjiko location, Nyanza. In this community, widows and divorced women affected by HIV and AIDS have become agents of positive change. Data from local surveys (2007), mapping of seasonal calendars (September 2009) and numerous focus group meetings and interviews with women in Onjiko (October 2008, January 2010, January 2011), reveal that despite a negative fall-back position, widows are improving their households' water and food security. This adaptation and even mitigation to some of the experienced climate impacts are emerging from their new activities in a setting of changing conditions. In the capacity of main livelihood providers, widows are gaining increased decision making and bargaining power. As such they can invest in sustainable innovations like rain water harvesting systems and agroforestry. Throughout, they worlc together in formalized groups of collective action that capitalize on the pooling of natural and human resources as well as planned financial management during hardship periods.

"""Can You Take the Heat?"" Heat-Induced Health Symptoms Are Associated with Protective Behaviors","The risks associated with extreme heat are increasing as heat waves become more frequent and severe across larger areas. As people begin to experience heat waves more often and in more places, how will individuals respond? Measuring experience with heat simply as exposure to extreme temperatures may not fully capture how people subjectively experience those temperatures or their varied impacts on human health. These impacts may also influence an individual's response to heat and motivate risk-reduction behaviors. If subjectively experiencing negative health effects from extreme heat promotes protective actions, these effects could be used alongside temperature exposure to more accurately measure extreme heat experience and inform risk prevention and communication strategies according to local community needs. Using a multilevel regression model, this study analyzes georeferenced national survey data to assess whether Americans' exposure to extreme heat and experience with its health effects are associated with self-reported protective behaviors. Subjective experience with heat-related health symptoms strongly predicted all reported protective behaviors while measured heat exposure had a much weaker influence. Risk perception was strongly associated with some behaviors. This study focuses particularly on the practice of checking on family, friends, and neighbors during a heat wave, which can be carried out by many people. For this behavior, age, race/ethnicity, gender, and income, along with subjective experience and risk perception, were important predictors. Results suggest that the subjective experience of extreme heat influences health-related behavioral responses and should therefore be considered when designing or improving local heat protection plans.",0.1268722292373103,0.5632999545866827,0.04332515013719884,0.11041438103758494,0.024405053888389393,0.39748257144670335,0.051756711956140324
ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE - EVIDENCE FROM GERMAN HOUSEHOLDS,"Using regional temperature variation as a substitute for data on long-run climate change, this paper investigates the adaptive behavior of private households in Germany. Information on adaptive behavior is taken from a newly established household panel on attitudes towards climate change. Estimating a random-effects probit model, we find that even small increases in temperature are sufficient to trigger adaptation: An increase of one degree Celsius in average summer temperature is associated with a rise of 2.31 percent points in adaptation probability. Further tore, the willingness to adapt is heterogeneous across socioeconomic groups.",0.6288685854400144,0.3372620709378225,0.11056209950025578,0.4071801612167037,0.08817060956567978,0.06376311467423834,0.06517438109733807
Integrating Health into Local Climate Response: Lessons from the US CDC Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative,"Public health has potential to serve as a frame to convey the urgency of behavior change needed to adapt to a changing climate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Local governments form the backbone of climate-related public health preparedness. Yet local health agencies are often inadequately prepared and poorly integrated into climate change assessments and plans. We reviewed the climate health profiles of 16 states and two cities participating in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative (CRSCI) that aims to build local capacity to assess and respond to the health impacts of climate change. Following recommendations from a recent expert panel strategic review, we present illustrations of emerging promising practice and future directions. We found that CRSCI has strengthened climate preparedness and response in local public health agencies by identifying critical climate-health impacts and vulnerable populations, and has helped integrate health more fully into broader climate planning. Promising practice was found in all three recommendation areas identified by the expert panel (leveraging partnerships, refining assessment methodologies and enhancing communications), particularly with regard to health impacts of extreme heat. Vast needs remain, however, suggesting the need to disseminate CRSCI experience to non-grantees. In conclusion, the CRSCI program approach and selected activities illustrate a way forward toward robust, targeted local preparedness and response that may serve as a useful example for public health departments in the United States and internationally, particularly at a time of uncertain commitment to climate change agreements at the national level.",0.0716637462530965,0.6391181728695158,0.12395723735867352,0.13744508407111364,0.046969757959526265,0.39824517319614855,0.07644645579520302
Survey of County-Level Heat Preparedness and Response to the 2011 Summer Heat in 30 US States,"BACKGROUND: Adapting to extreme heat is becoming more critical as our climate changes. Previous research reveals that very few communities in the United States have programs to sufficiently prevent health problems during hot weather. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to examine county-level local heat preparedness and response in 30 U.S. states following the unusually hot summer of 2011. METHODS: Using a multimodal survey approach, we invited local health and emergency response departments from 586 counties to participate in the largest survey to date of heat preparedness and response in the United States. County-level responses were pooled into national and regional-level summaries. Logistic regressions modeled associations between heat planning/response and county characteristics, including population, poverty rates, typical summer weather, and 2011 summer weather. RESULTS: Of 586 counties, 190 (32%) responded to the survey. Only 40% of these counties had existing heat plans. The most common heat responses were communication about heat, outreach, and collaborations with other organizations. Both heat preparedness and heat response were, on average, more extensive in counties with higher populations, lower poverty rates, and lower percentages of older people. Heat response was generally more extensive in counties with heat plans. CONCLUSIONS: Most responding counties were underprepared for extreme heat in 2011 and lacked a formal response plan. Because counties with heat plans were more likely to act to prevent adverse heat impacts to residents, local health departments should consider adopting such plans, especially because increased extreme heat is anticipated with further climate change.",0.1191698043274351,0.5,0.07385225475767275,0.243465633382655,0.033806600687522746,0.4084982476885315,0.023102746321843098
"Climate Change, Drought and Human Health in Canada","Droughts have been recorded all across Canada and have had significant impacts on individuals and communities. With climate change, projections suggest an increasing risk of drought in Canada, particularly in the south and interior. However, there has been little research on the impacts of drought on human health and the implications of a changing climate. A review of the Canadian, U.S. and international literature relevant to the Canadian context was conducted to better define these impacts and adaptations available to protect health. Drought can impact respiratory health, mental health, illnesses related to exposure to toxins, food/water security, rates of injury and infectious diseases (including food-, water- and vector-borne diseases). A range of direct and indirect adaptation (e.g., agricultural adaptation) options exist to cope with drought. Many have already been employed by public health officials, such as communicable disease monitoring and surveillance and public education and outreach. However, gaps exist in our understanding of the impacts of short-term vs. prolonged drought on the health of Canadians, projections of drought and its characteristics at the regional level and the effectiveness of current adaptations. Further research will be critical to inform adaptation planning to reduce future drought-related risks to health.",0.37687720634292654,0.44205261386029593,0.12446365087084693,0.20339720338683231,0.03456870096885644,0.12966994751161884,0.2634477312044771

Health impacts of climate and environmental change: Awareness and challenges to adaptation,"Taking a point of departure in current knowledge about the existing health situation in Vietnam and insights into interrelationships between social, environmental and institutional risk factors and health, this chapter reports on small-scale health surveys conducted in purposely selected communities of the Thang Binh district of Quang Nam province. The surveys aimed at exploring awareness of and coping to environmental and climate change induced health problems. In the surveys most respondents associated climate change with abnormal weather conditions and typically mentioned seawater level rise, storms, floods and increase in temperature. Generally, respondents had observed considerable changes in health patterns in recent years however, without linking these clearly to climate change or climate factors but rather to a change in environmental determinants of health such as food, water and air quality. The observations are consistent with a wider socio-economic household survey, reporting a worsening of the health condition by a majority of households. A range of coping mechanisms were highlighted by community members and local authorities as ways and means of protecting each other and individual households and their members in times of increased extreme weather events and general environmental change. Future new actions should ideally be informed by parallel research initiatives and the present small-scale survey may stimulate more in-depth and broader studies that may help to identify proper, sustainable solutions for future adaptation and coping to climate and environmental change. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0.27250352952230894,0.4796725763182593,0.061084445601023225,0.31896908851269845,0.07273882422653552,0.08596596024810262,0.08815480746461857

"The New State of Nature: Rising Sea-levels, Climate Justice, and Community-based Adaptation in Papua New Guinea (2003-2011)","If a legal 'vacuum' exists at the international level, and no domestic or national remedy can be found, and (non-government organisations) NGOs have not taken up their cause, then where may climate vulnerable people look to find adaptation strategies and remedies for the equity and justice issues contained within them? With the goal of investigating one kind of answer to this question, this case study examines local-level discourse about the prospect of internal resettlement in Papua New Guinea, where slow-onset, coastal erosion has been going on since 2003. Among the several points illustrated, an institutional absence is revealed-the postcolonial state. In response to its ineffective initiative, villagers express ambivalences about, and attachments to, place, as well as fears about resettlement. They have also begun to devise and debate community-based adaptations.

The effects of climate change on the geography and timing of human mobility,"Human mobility over different distances and time scales has long been associated with environmental change, and the idea of climate change is now affecting movement in new ways. In this paper, we discuss three cases from the South Pacific to explain the ways anticipated climate futures are changing mobility in the present. First, we examine village relocation in response to coastal erosion and inundation in Fiji, drawing on our study of the unfolding experience of Narikoso village in Kadavu Province. In contrast to this spatially constrained process of permanent relocation, we examine the spatially extended yet temporally constrained seasonal migrant worker programme that aims to support economic development in the Pacific Islands by providing temporary work visas in Australia and New Zealand. Finally, we examine the likely effects of proposed open labour markets as a means to promote climate change adaptation, through a study of the analogous example of Niuean migration to New Zealand which has resulted in both permanent migration and a slow circulation of people between both countries. Across these examples, we highlight emerging and potentially constructive ways in which climate change is altering the spatio-temporal patterns and rhythms of mobility.",0.2914592786135261,0.445405536008339,0.17678397469032353,0.36126410776380796,0.21327747467430963,0.09766196331640044,0.05864659275620075

The Role of Health in Urban Climate Adaptation: An Analysis of Six US Cities,"Climate change threatens the health of urban residents in many ways. This qualitative study aims to understand how six U.S. cities are considering health adaptation when responding to climate change; 65 semi-structured interviews were conducted with salient stakeholders across six U.S. cities (Boston, Massachusetts; Los Angeles, California; Portland, Oregon; Raleigh, North Carolina; Tampa, Florida; and Tucson, Arizona), and transcripts were analyzed to identify common themes. Each city's (or county's) most recent climate action plan was also analyzed. This study found that interviewees' ability to understand the connection between climate and health was a major determinant for health adaptation implementation. In addition, institutional fragmentation in governance made it difficult to incorporate health concerns into broader climate planning. However, cross-sectoral collaborations and considerations of health cobenefits were shown to help overcome these barriers. These findings offer valuable insight regarding how policy makers and practitioners can safeguard public health from the effects of climate change.",0.1068803746283056,0.6131824384672321,0.09798065098111239,0.13151277833848324,0.05091116736776962,0.44089561342193667,0.05893943119276284
Health Vulnerability of Households in Flooded Communities and Their Adaptation Measures: Case Study in Northeastern Thailand,"Floods adversely affect community well-being and health. This study aims to assess the present health vulnerability of households to floods in a rural flood-prone area of northeastern Thailand, as well as their adaptation measures. The participants were the representatives of 312 randomly selected households, and data were collected using an interview questionnaire. Health vulnerability was assessed in terms of flood exposure, flood sensitivity, and flood adaptive capacity. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The results showed that 47.1% of the households had a low level of health vulnerability to flooding, while in 21.2% the level was high. Households had been adapting themselves to cope with the health impacts from flood. Their coping practices included special arrangements for the protection of property, food management, the provision of water supply and waste disposal, the elimination of sources of vector-borne diseases, family health care, the protection of family livelihood, and communication and transportation.",0.320068789424608,0.5110064898388642,0.08124460991098112,0.4347224458311189,0.0979868921095824,0.220630967976287,0.39640525253784875
Perceptions of climate change and occupational heat stress risks and adaptation strategies of mining workers in Ghana,"Heavy physical workload for long hours coupled with increasing workplace heat exposure due to rising temperatures stemming from climate change, especially where there are inadequate prevention and control policies, adversely affect workers health and safety, productive capacity and social well-being. However, variations in workers' concerns and awareness of occupational heat stress and climate change risks impede the effectiveness of heat stress management. A mixed method approach was used to assess climate change perceptions and occupational heat stress risks and adaptation strategies of Ghanaian mining workers. Questionnaires and focus group discussions were used to collect data from 320 respondents. Quantitative and qualitative approaches were used for data analysis. Workers' climate change risk perception, as confirmed by trends in climate data, was reasonable, but concerns about climate change effects and workplace heat exposure risks varied significantly across types of mining activity (p < 0.001). Workers experienced heat-related morbidities, but the variation in heat-related morbidity experiences across the type of mining activity was not significant. However, the type of heat-related morbidities experienced by workers differed across the type of mining activity (p < 0.001). Workers' awareness of occupational heat stress prevention and control was adequate. The disparities in workers awareness and use of the prevention and control measures significantly differed across the type of mining activity (p < 0.001). Occupational heat stress prevention activities should focus on workers, and a concerted effort must be made to promote workers adaptive capacity and inform policy decisions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

"Protective factors for mental health and well-being in a changing climate: Perspectives from Inuit youth in Nunatsiavut, Labrador","The Canadian Arctic is experiencing rapid changes in climatic conditions, with implications for Inuit communities widely documented. Youth have been identified as an at-risk population, with likely impacts on mental health and well-being. This study identifies and characterizes youth-specific protective factors that enhance well-being in light of a rapidly changing climate, and examines how climatic and environmental change challenges these. In-depth conversational interviews were conducted with youth aged 15-25 from the five communities of the Nunatsiavut region of Labrador, Canada: Nain, Hopedale, Postville, Makkovik, and Rigolet. Five key protective factors were identified as enhancing their mental health and well-being: being on the land; connecting to Inuit culture; strong communities; relationships with family and friends; and staying busy. Changing sea ice and weather conditions were widely reported to be compromising these protective factors by reducing access to the land, and increasing the danger of land-based activities. This study contributes to existing work on Northern climate change adaptation by identifying factors that enhance youth resilience and, if incorporated into adaptation strategies, may contribute to creating successful and effective adaptation responses.

Using Social Network Analysis to Evaluate Health-Related Adaptation Decision-Making in Cambodia,"Climate change adaptation in the health sector requires decisions across sectors, levels of government, and organisations. The networks that link these different institutions, and the relationships among people within these networks, are therefore critical influences on the nature of adaptive responses to climate change in the health sector. This study uses social network research to identify key organisational players engaged in developing health-related adaptation activities in Cambodia. It finds that strong partnerships are reported as developing across sectors and different types of organisations in relation to the health risks from climate change. Government ministries are influential organisations, whereas donors, development banks and non-government organisations do not appear to be as influential in the development of adaptation policy in the health sector. Finally, the study highlights the importance of informal partnerships (or 'shadow networks') in the context of climate change adaptation policy and activities. The health governance 'map' in relation to health and climate change adaptation that is developed in this paper is a novel way of identifying organisations that are perceived as key agents in the decision-making process, and it holds substantial benefits for both understanding and intervening in a broad range of climate change-related policy problems where collaboration is paramount for successful outcomes.",0.20371582897712723,0.5943619032903994,0.12201868076488007,0.26509774670862224,0.1287544690541932,0.1445491510597171,0.06688574420094404
Using a Social Justice and Health Framework to Assess European Climate Change Adaptation Strategies,"Climate change puts pressure on existing health vulnerabilities through higher frequency of extreme weather events, changes in disease vector distribution or exacerbated air pollution. Climate change adaptation policies may hold potential to reduce societal inequities. We assessed the role of public health and social justice in European climate change adaptation using a three-fold approach: a document analysis, a critical discourse analysis of a subgroup of strategies, and a ranking of strategies against our social justice framework. The ranking approach favored planning that includes various adaptation types, social issues and infrastructure changes. Themes on values identified in the five subgroup documents showed that risks are perceived as contradictory, technology is viewed as savior, responsibilities need to be negotiated, and social justice is advocated by only a few countries. Of 21 strategy documents assessed overall, those from Austria, England and Sweden received the highest scores in the ranking. Our qualitative assessment showed that in European adaptation planning, progress could still be made through community involvement into adaptation decisions, consistent consideration of social and demographic determinants, and a stronger link between infrastructural adaptation and the health sector. Overall, a social justice framework can serve as an evaluation guideline for adaptation policy documents.",0.16484719726589717,0.4374836398157363,0.13321530756942032,0.2872455405143076,0.08091023072597103,0.207376473336238,0.061236577485362646
A multilevel analysis to explain self-reported adverse health effects and adaptation to urban heat: a cross-sectional survey in the deprived areas of 9 Canadian cities,"Background: This study identifies the characteristics and perceptions related to the individual, the dwelling and the neighbourhood of residence associated with the prevalence of self-reported adverse health impacts and an adaptation index when it is very hot and humid in summer in the most disadvantaged sectors of the nine most populous cities of Quebec, Canada, in 2011. Methods: The study uses a cross-sectional design and a stratified representative sample; 3485 people (individual-level) were interviewed in their residence. They lived in 1647 buildings (building-level) in 87 most materially and socially disadvantaged census dissemination areas (DA-level). Multilevel analysis was used to perform 3-level models nested one in the other to examine individual impacts as well as the adaptation index. Results: For the prevalence of impacts, which is 46 %, the logistic model includes 13 individual-level indicators (including air conditioning and the adaptation index) and 1 building-level indicator. For the adaptation index, with values ranging from -3 to +3, the linear model has 10 individual-level indicators, 1 building-level indicator and 2 DA-level indicators. Of all these indicators, 9 were associated to the prevalence of impacts only and 8 to the adaptation index only. Conclusion: This 3-level analysis shows the differential importance of the characteristics of residents, buildings and their surroundings on self-reported adverse health impacts and on adaptation (other than air conditioning) under hot and humid summer conditions. It also identifies indicators specific to impacts or adaptation. People with negative health impacts from heat rely more on adaptation strategies while low physical activity and good dwelling/building insulation lead to lower adaptation. Better neighbourhood walkability favors adaptations other than air conditioning. Thus, adaptation to heat in these neighbourhoods seems reactive rather than preventive. These first multi-level insights pave the way for the development of a theoretical framework of the process from heat exposure to impacts and adaptation for research, surveillance and public health interventions at all relevant levels.",0.2744814414976872,0.44688687148319056,0.07391378747842611,0.25277746275368346,0.060821770091447944,0.3301158841243373,0.07839764511023234
Social impacts of occupational heat stress and adaptation strategies of workers: A narrative synthesis of the literature,"Dimensions of risks and impacts of occupational heat stress due to climate change on workers' health and safety, productivity, and social well-being are significantly deleterious. Aside from empirical evidence, no systematic review exists for policy development and decision making in managing occupation heat stress impacts and adaptation strategies of workers. This study sought to synthesise evidence on the social impacts of occupational heat stress and adaptation strategies of workers. From a review of existing literature, eight categories were obtained from 25 studies and grouped into three syntheses: (1) awareness of occupational heat stress, (2) social impacts of occupational heat stress and (3) workers' adaptation to occupational heat stress due to changing climate. Awareness of occupational heat stress among workers varied and their social impacts were related to workers' health and safety, productivity and social well-being. Sustainable adaptation to occupation heat stress due to climate change hinges on financial resource availability. Adequate investment and research are required to develop and implement policies to combat the threat of rising temperature and climate change to enhance workers' adaptive capacity, boost resilience and foster sustainable development.

Facing the heat: A systematic literature review exploring the transferability of solutions to cope with urban heat waves,"Urban heat waves are an increasing phenomenon around the world. Over the last decade the combination of climate change and the urban heat island effect have resulted in rising temperatures in cities. The related heat stress has severe impact on urban populations and infrastructure. However, it is unclear to what extent solutions to urban heat waves depend on context or if similarities can be identified that would support their adoption to different urban settings. The purpose of this study is to gain a better overview of solution characteristics and ultimately of their transferability. Based on a systematic qualitative and quantitative literature review we analysed solutions to urban heat waves with regard to geographical distribution, specific characteristics and pivotal actors. Results show that the sampled case studies concentrated on North America, Europe and Australia. The analysed solutions focus mostly on the use of green and blue infrastructure or grey infrastructure. Our review highlights city administration as pivotal actor for implementing solutions and emphasizes the importance of inhabitants as well as local governments as essential actors for adaptation to urban heat waves. We conclude by formulating recommendations to increase transferability of solutions to urban heat waves.",0.06137308474565608,0.3985365087910516,0.07620318971135298,0.1769231951231762,0.039366545062412064,0.8285316241988653,0.038315019355623675
"Citizen engagement in climate adaptation surveyed: The role of values, worldviews, gender and place","Local governments' limited mandate and capacity to adequately deal with increasing climate risk and impacts means that citizen engagement is becoming increasingly important for adapting to hazards such as floods and storms. Stronger collaborative approaches are urgently needed. At the same time, there is little research and hardly any empirical evidence on what inspires adaptation engagement in different citizen groups. Against this background, this paper examines the external/material (e.g., resources, hazards, public support) and internal aspects (e.g., values and worldviews) that shape people's engagement in and for adaptation. Based on a survey of Swedish citizens at risk from severe climate events, we show that engagement is a gendered process, which is mediated by personal values, worldviews and place aspects rarely considered in public adaptation. While a high level of diverse citizen action is often related to past experiences of hazards, motivation to adapt goes beyond the idea of acting out of rational self-interest. Economic considerations (e.g., low cost) are not the only motivation to adapt; the potential of an adaptation action to contribute to green, thriving surroundings and mitigate global climate change was found nearly as (and among female respondents, more) motivating. Women were also found to be more motivated to engage in adaptation if this supports other community members at risk. At the same time, past adaptation action could not be linked to motivation to adapt, and was found to be negatively correlated with communitarian and ecological values or worldviews. This confirms that motivation to adapt does not automatically translate into action, and indicates a 'mitigation-adaptation gap' in people's climate awareness, which can lead to ineffective climate responses. Given these findings, we discuss alternative approaches to support increased citizen engagement and more effective and transformative climate action. We end with a call for public adaptation and risk communication that takes greater account of inner/subjective dimensions. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Adapting air quality management for a changing climate: Survey of local districts in California,"Air quality can be affected by weather and thus is sensitive to a changing climate. Wildfire (influenced by weather), consecutive high temperature summer days, and other extreme events are projected to become more severe and frequent with climate change. These may create challenging conditions for managing air quality despite policy targets to reduce precursor and pollutant emissions. Although extreme events are becoming more intense and interest in climate adaptation is increasing among public health practitioners, little attention in scholarly literature and policy covers climate adaptation for air quality governance. Understanding the management and managers' perspectives at the local level provides insight about the needs for climate adaptation, including their adaptation status, perspectives, responsibilities, and roles. This study explores local manager perspectives and experiences of managing air quality within a changing climate as one puzzle piece to understand the gap in climate adaptation within the air quality sector. A broader goal is to contribute to the discussion of developing a multi-jurisdictional vision for reducing the impacts of air quality in a changing climate. In 2016 local air quality district managers in California were invited to participate in an online survey of 39 questions focused on extreme event impacts on air quality. The questionnaire focused on present air quality threats and extreme event challenges, adaptation status and strategies, adaptive capacities, perceived barriers to adaptation, and jurisdictional responsibilities and roles. Over 85 percent of the 35 local air districts in California participated in the survey, which represents 80 percent of the state's population. High awareness and knowledge of climate change among local managers indicates they are ready to adopt and take action on policies that would support climate adaptation, but barriers reported suggests they may need policies and adequate funding to take action and make necessary changes.Implications: Downscaled global climate models project an increasing severity and frequency of extreme events. In the southwestern United States, these include wildfire, heat events, and dry periods, among others, all of which can place an extra burden on air quality managers and emitters to achieve air quality standards even as they reduce emissions. Despite climate change presenting increasing challenges to meet air quality standards, in the southwestern United States, policy and action to mitigate these impacts have been surprisingly absent. California presents a valuable case study on the topic because of its historic leadership in air quality management for the United States and also because of its initiatives in combating climate change. Yet still we found that adaptation has not been incorporated into air quality management thus far, but local managers seem sufficiently knowledgeable and willing.",0.1448494384662883,0.3969749254654924,0.1339697866772927,0.1525584058957908,0.044913160587005986,0.3097806619153054,0.14020088073595552
Grassroots Technologies and Community Trust in Climate Change Adaptation: Learning from Coastal Settlements of Bangladesh,"This paper reports doctoral research that explores grassroots technologies as an asset for poor coastal communities of Bangladesh, how local knowledge contributes to the creation of such technologies, and how they can be useful to build a communityâ€™s trust in its own adaptive capacity. Bangladesh is one of the most disaster vulnerable countries in the world due to its deltaic morphology and frequent climate-induced hazards (storm surge, annual flooding, salinity intrusion, frequent cyclones, etc.). Southwestern coastal settlements are especially vulnerable because people considered among the poorest in the world inhabit them. To cope with climate extremes under severe resource limitations, grassroots technologies evolve over generations from autonomous decision-making processes and creative experimentation. However, communities often fail to recognize the value of these technologies and may have little trust in their innate capacity for climate change adaptation. A conceptual framework will be presented that identifies the interactions among grassroots technology, local knowledge, community trust and climate change adaptation. The framework will be validated in case studies of specific grassroots technologies identified through field observations, and explored through qualitative methods to understand the importance of indigenous knowledge to the development of community-based climate coping strategies.

Sustainable survival under climatic extremes: linking flood risk mitigation and coping with flood damages in rural Pakistan,"Various measures are adopted by flood-prone households for the mitigation of flood risk along with various post-flood coping strategies. We analyze the role of various ex ante household-level flood mitigation strategies in influencing riverine flood damages. The study also presents an account on the linkages of various ex post coping strategies and flood damages experienced in a flood event in Pakistan. For achieving a uniform flood damage indicator, polychoric principle component analysis (PCA) is employed to construct a composite flood damage index considering various aspects of economic, social, and psychological impacts of a flood event. The adjusted flood damage index is regressed on various socioeconomic features and ex ante mitigation actions to know their effect on the former. Results indicate that distance from river, elevating house, and pre-shifting investigating about flooding problem help in significantly reducing the overall flood damages. Likewise, group-based actions like voting political candidates based on their flood-control promises, organizing grass-root group meetings, and raising voices through memos/petitions are found to significantly reduce flood-related damages while leaving house premises before flooding is foundto increase the overall flood damage. Post-flood coping strategies comprise of social and financial support along with some livelihood diversification and disinvestment strategies such as selling livestock, jewelry, and withdrawing children from schools. Borrowing money, reducing food consumption, and agricultural diversification are more prevalent strategiesamong low and medium damage groups while consuming savings is more conspicuous among high damage group. The study concludes with the emphasis on policy interventions for effective early warning, location-specific flood intensity information, and proper streamlining of planning process and compensation system.",0.17348659226238297,0.3357109678528616,0.06802188471236958,0.30309932953925484,0.1604052534180255,0.4501809447915661,0.6258100200135117
A study on the perception of heat waves among urban residents: Based on a survey in Fuzhou,"Climate change is characterized by warming trends, consequences of which are heat waves. These major meteorological disasters have severely threatened ecosystems, social and economic development, and human survival. At present, research on heat waves focuses on their description, causation, and consequences. Currently, little research describes the public perception of heat waves, even as this perception forms the social foundation of human response and adaptation to this phenomenon and has aroused interests of scholars both domestic and abroad. Our survey of 585 residents of Fuzhou, an urban area severely affected by heat waves, shows that: (1) most Fuzhou residents (75.56%) were able to correctly discern the local warming trend and 85.81% believes that this trend has become more severe since 2000, in accordance with meteorological data; (2) most Fuzhou residents (79.83%) have experienced heat waves and noticed their impact: 85.81% believed that heat waves significantly affected daily life, while 14.02% reported no effects. (3) ANOVA revealed that perceptions differed among subgroups. The perception of the warming trend differs significantly across age groups, increasing at first and then decreasing. Moreover, the perception of the impact of heat waves correlates with health, gradually decreasing with improved health levels. No correlation was found with gender, education, or occupational factors, consistent with previous reports. In addition, the results demonstrate that local residents spontaneously adopt a variety of adaptive behaviors during heat waves; these include increasing water intake, making dietary adjustments, installing air-conditioning, wearing cooler clothing, and using shading devices. Factors determining the adaptive measures chosen include income and convenience. Although air conditioning can effectively mitigate heat wave impact, because widespread use of this technology enhances the urban heat island effect and the risk of future heat waves, measures should be taken to reduce it. In the context of global warming, most metropolitan areas in China have been heavily affected by heat waves. Perceptions of heat waves among urban residents, which will guide them in taking measures to alleviate negative impacts, is a crucial area requiring further study, the results of which can serve as a valuable resource for local governments. © 2015 Ecological Society of China.

"Framing climate change in frontline communities: anthropological insights on how mountain dwellers in the USA, Peru, and Italy adapt to glacier retreat","We report on anthropological research conducted in three mountain communities (in the USA, Italy and Peru), which have been directly affected by glacier retreat for over 40years. Our mixed methods include ethnographic research, analysis of transcripts of interviews, focus groups and community meetings, and case studies of adaptation projects. Our findings indicate that local people are acute observers of change. They draw on two frames (climate change and community) in their discussions and projects but rely much more heavily on the latter frame. This pattern of drawing on the community frame, characteristic of all discussions, is most marked in the community meetings. The effectiveness of the community frame in supporting projects calls into question some widely shared notions about the role of belief in climate change as a crucial precondition for adaptation and challenges the perceive-predict-act model of climate change response.",0.38554683499605724,0.4181412846287251,0.1698617654217333,0.4177464210451764,0.09808236412971076,0.06905169584700045,0.14146107549154657
Climate change adaptation in South Africa: a case study on the role of the health sector,"BackgroundGlobally, the response to climate change is gradually gaining momentum as the impacts of climate change unfold. In South Africa, it is increasingly apparent that delays in responding to climate change over the past decades have jeopardized human life and livelihoods. While slow progress with mitigation, especially in the energy sector, has garnered much attention, focus is now shifting to developing plans and systems to adapt to the impacts of climate change.MethodsWe applied systematic review methods to assess progress with climate change adaptation in the health sector in South Africa. This case study provides useful lessons which could be applied in other countries in the African region, or globally. We reviewed the literature indexed in PubMed and Web of Science, together with relevant grey literature. We included articles describing adaptation interventions to reduce the impact of climate change on health in South Africa. All study designs were eligible. Data from included articles and grey literature were summed thematically.ResultsOf the 820 publications screened, 21 were included, together with an additional xx papers. Very few studies presented findings of an intervention or used high-quality research designs. Several policy frameworks for climate change have been developed at national and local government levels. These, however, pay little attention to health concerns and the specific needs of vulnerable groups. Systems for forecasting extreme weather, and tracking malaria and other infections appear well established. Yet, there is little evidence about the country's preparedness for extreme weather events, or the ability of the already strained health system to respond to these events. Seemingly, few adaptation measures have taken place in occupational and other settings. To date, little attention has been given to climate change in training curricula for health workers.ConclusionsOverall, the volume and quality of research is disappointing, and disproportionate to the threat posed by climate change in South Africa. This is surprising given that the requisite expertise for policy advocacy, identifying effective interventions and implementing systems-based approaches rests within the health sector. More effective use of data, a traditional strength of health professionals, could support adaptation and promote accountability of the state. With increased health-sector leadership, climate change could be reframed as predominately a health issue, one necessitating an urgent, adequately-resourced response. Such a shift in South Africa, but also beyond the country, may play a key role in accelerating climate change adaptation and mitigation.",0.14326849781644554,0.4846927791311467,0.06411054129421628,0.16060039436018259,0.06113794669522441,0.19477583446573554,0.05874567155796632
Community perceptions and responses to climate variability: Insights from the Himalayas,"A prerequisite for the formulation of effective adaptation strategies and plans is an in-depth understanding of impacts resultant of climate variability, the measures adopted by communities as a response to such stress and the support needs to reduce vulnerabilities arising out of such challenges. A satisfactory, updated information base covering all these aspects is difficult to come by, particularly in the Hindu Kush Himalayan countries, posing serious challenges for any agency tasked with the responsibility of formulating climate change adaptation strategies and plans. To bridge this knowledge gap, an extensive participatory assessment was undertaken in selected districts of Bhutan, India and Nepal, covering 90 villages spanning an altitudinal range of 50-3500 MSL. The results of this extensive survey are reported in this chapter, with special focus on perceptions of mountain communities on climate variability, their impacts and the responses of the communities to overcome the resultant stress. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",0.5488945897786327,0.3654664648935863,0.10912977274919207,0.4739844290396908,0.08664807983227914,0.07464279563469392,0.08963909570786313
Understanding climate adaptation investments for communities living in desert Australia: experiences of indigenous communities,"Climate change is predicted to lead to warmer temperatures and more intense storms within the century in central and northern Australia. The ensuing impacts are anticipated to present immense challenges for remote communities, in terms of maintaining housing comfort, family health and wellbeing, engagement in education and employment, and community services and businesses. About 50 % of the Australian landmass is considered remote and it is home to a highly dispersed population of about half a million people (with 30 % being Indigenous people). Much of the population in remote Australia is considered highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change as they are highly exposed and sensitive to the impacts, with many having a low adaptive capacity. The lives of Aboriginal Australians living in remote communities are strongly influenced and governed by traditional customs, knowledge and practices. Even when living in large towns, people who are strongly connected to their country are able to blend knowledge from traditional and modern sources to adapt to the current climate. This article explores the extent of adaptive capacity of people to climate change in a small remote community and large service town in the Northern Territory of Australia and provides insights about their capacities and vulnerabilities. Results indicate that the social and cultural capital are of greater importance than commonly assessed and provide scope to enhance effective community-based climate adaptation.",0.38355840260527485,0.5108503304250341,0.12088945922993186,0.42439560744230304,0.13957153457386434,0.05595474502589953,0.1612705454021733
"Perceptions of Heat Risk to Health: A Qualitative Study of Professional Bus Drivers and Their Managers in Jinan, China","Summer extreme heat threatens the health of individuals, especially persons who are involved in outdoor activities. Ensuring the normal function of a city, bus drivers are among those who participate in outdoor physical activities and are exposed to excessive heat in hot summer weather. This qualitative study was performed to explore professional bus drivers' in-depth views of extreme heat risks to their health, and ultimately develop targeted advice and policy interventions for city bus drivers. An interview-based study was performed among professional bus drivers in Jinan, China, including four focus groups with professional bus drivers (n = 37) and three interviews with their managers (n = 14). Five central themes or categories from the bus driver interviews were found: concerns about summer heat; health effects related to extreme heat; adaptive measures; barriers in implementing these adaptive measures; and suggested interventions. The beneficial role of cooling facilities (particularly air-conditioning) during extreme heat are addressed. The barriers not only impede the implementation of behavioral adaptive measures but also enhance the negative attitudes of bus drivers towards their effectiveness. The responsibilities of managers in promoting preventive actions are addressed.",0.1484893944792145,0.5645700108734395,0.0873494638343631,0.1903628212325199,0.03600505331330303,0.2061315147194508,0.025235413122818042
Agricultural Technology Adoption under Climate Change in the Sahel: Micro-evidence from Niger,"In this article, we assess the determinants of adoption of agricultural technologies under climate risk and evaluate their impact on food security using data from Niger, together with a set of novel weather variation indicators. We employ multivariate probit and instrumental variable techniques to model adoption decisions and their impact. We find that the adoption of both modern inputs (inorganic fertiliser and improved seed) and organic fertiliser is positively associated with crop productivity and crop income. The use of crop residues does not seem to correlate positively with crop productivity and could even have a negative effect. We find a strong negative association on crop productivity among households reporting that they had experienced a delayed onset of the rainy season. We also find that factors driving modern input use are different from those of crop residues and organic fertiliser. While the latter can be characterised as low-investment capital requirements, more labour requirements and longer times for results, the former includes higher investment capital requirements, fewer labour requirements and shorter times for returns. Furthermore, we find that weather variability is one of the strongest determinants of the type of practice adopted. In regions with greater rainfall and temperature variability, crop residue incorporation into soils is more widely adopted. The probability of using modern inputs and organic fertiliser is negatively and strongly correlated with variability in rainfall and temperature. Households with higher levels of wealth, education and labour are most likely to adopt modern inputs. Distance to the nearest market and extension service also plays a strong role in adoption; the greater the distance, the less likely they are to use modern inputs. The converse holds true for organic fertiliser use: the greater distance the farm household is from the market and the extension centre, the more likely it is to use organic fertiliser.",0.9350592208208586,0.23957028348794082,0.07009107937588804,0.5296708633975299,0.02846386302777009,0.02046404114190216,0.01965030619033193
Rural agriculture and adaptation strategies to the climate change in North Benin,"The adaptation to hazards and the management of the risk are everywhere considered in the traditional land systems. As a matter of fact, the global climate change is locally manifested through the evolutions which modify the production conditions. The present study is about the understanding of the strategies developed by the producers in condition climate changes, of its visible effects in the agrarian landscape and the policies set up to face it. It is based on a sample of 270 producers in the different agri-ecological areas in North of Benin. The impact of climate change on agriculture is multiple and weighs on the people, the capital of exploitations of the results (stock rearing system and crops less productive). To face these impacts, the producers have set up adaptation systems. They begin modifying their cultural habits. In effect, the farmers change the ranges (search for periodicity as factor of adaptation to the reduction of pluviometry), even the cultivated species to prioritize the crops more hardy. The farming habits also progress as well on the level of achievement dates as on the techniques used (dropping out of the work of the soil in certain cases for example). The use of the means of production (work, inputs) is thought to take into account the risks: this is manifested in some cases through extensification, elsewhere through the concentration of the means on the ""more plausible"" spaces (concerning mainly the available water). Another way of adaptation explored by the producers is based on the development of new agricultural activities in order to try to distribute the risks and / or to adapt themselves to the new conditions of production: integration of new speculations, implantation of food crops by some cattle-breeders, practice of rearing used by farmers development of truck-farming and small rearing then the processing of the products.",0.8754557323279938,0.2275173974142367,0.10341275654364802,0.40259306626039487,0.05682760824998722,0.03437242838926933,0.04022109762743383
Using a migration systems approach to understand the link between climate change and urbanisation in Malawi,"Most scholarship on rural urban migration in Sub-Saharan Africa demonstrates that migrants tend to move in a ""circular"" fashion and only spend short periods of time in cities before returning home to rural villages. However, some scholars working on the impacts of climate change on migration suggest that deteriorating environmental conditions may undermine rural livelihoods and lead people to move to cities for longer periods of time. If this is true, then climate change threatens to accelerate urbanisation and lead to renewed stress on urban infrastructure. The purpose of this paper is to explore these positions and we do so by collecting survey [n = 241], in-depth interview [n = 75] and focus group [n = 123 participants] data from rural and urban Malawi. Two key results stand out as significant. The first is that migrants in Malawi's capital city tend to stay in the urban environment for longer periods of time than conventional understandings of migration would predict. The second key result is that climate change may actually lead, in the case of Malawi, to reverse (i.e urban rural) migration. This is because many of the people in Malawi's cities depend on products produced in rural environments (e.g. food and fuel-wood). If climate change undermines rural livelihoods, then many urban residents will find the basis of their livelihoods removed and will likely respond by moving back to rural villages. Overall, our results, therefore, suggest that in at least one case the effect of climate change on migration may not be to increase migration towards cities but to stimulate an exodus from cities and back to the rural countryside.

Fostering food security and climate resilience through integrated landscape restoration practices and rainwater harvesting/management in arid and semi-arid areas of Ethiopia,"Land degradation and rainfall variability are severe problems affecting sub-Saharan Africa. Ethiopia is one of the countries in the region which is hugely impacted by these processes. To circumvent the impacts of these problems, the country has been involved in implementing various landscape restoration and water harvesting (LRWH) practices since the 1970s. However, the success of these efforts has been limited especially at the earlier periods. The major reasons include the top-down approach followed to implementation of the LRWH practices, mismatch between landscape characteristics and recommended LRWH options, lack of appropriate monitoring and maintenance of schemes, and low adoption rate by communities due to limited economic return from the interventions. Despite these bottlenecks, however, various achievements have been recorded in some parts of the country. In those areas, the interventions have significantly changed the environmental and socio-economic conditions of the areas. Understanding the key drivers that promoted successful restoration of landscapes and water resources could help in designing appropriate technologies and their implementation mechanisms. This study aims to assess the biophysical and socio-economic conditions that need to be fulfilled for LRWH technologies to be adopted and be effective and to enhance resilience to climate/rainfall variability. We critically reviewed five successful cases in Tigray region to understand the critical elements to be considered when identifying, introducing and managing LRWH options. The results show that promotion of integrated management practices considering the whole landscape continuum is essential for LRWH options to succeed and create resi- lience to climate variability. It is also observed that interventions should be designed considering both agro-ecological, land use/cover, soil, geomorphological, hydrogeological, socio-economic and institutional conditions of specific landscapes/watersheds. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",0.7947915504919117,0.30224763124300286,0.14628084598120109,0.5734363178613902,0.05720594174691416,0.06598319196479084,0.13295411184419131
Cassava Farming Transforming Livelihoods Among Smallholder Farmers in Mutomo a Semi-arid District in Kenya,"The study established that climate change is real and has negatively affected smallholder farmer families in Mutomo and as such it was prudent to introduce drought tolerant crops like cassava in order to improve food security as a climate change adaptation technology. It was evident that the elite cassava varieties from KARI were supplying the much needed carbohydrates in an affordable form. The assessment also established water scarcity is a major development-limiting factor in Mutomo that needed urgent attention. The Mutomo community had shed ""Mwolyo"" the hand-out mentality through adoption of appropriate technologies for this place like growing, processing, marketing, and consumption of cassava. Cassava roots were mainly marketed as fresh roots for chewing and boiling. Cassava cuttings and cakes on sale in the Mutomo market suggested that demand for cassava was rising and only need upscaling. Being dominated by agro-pastoralists, it was obvious that cassava and other crops that take more than four months before being harvested do not fit well into the system and this is an area that has to be addressed to pre-empt potential conflicts.",0.7938087453445306,0.24838774713582099,0.095563405017414,0.4328258006038669,0.03663542512035089,0.047480069535387824,0.11559378081404326
Divergent adaptation to climate variability: A case study of pastoral and agricultural societies in Niger,"Adaptation is a complex, dynamic, and sometimes unequal process. Stemming from social ecological systems theories of climate change adaptation and adaptive capacity, this case study introduces the concept of 'divergent' adaptation. Adaptation is divergent when one user or group's adaptation causes a subsequent reduction in another user or group's adaptive capacity in the same ecosystem. Using the example of pastoral and agricultural groups in northern and southern rainfall zones of Niger, this study illustrates the concept of divergent adaptation by identifying changes to the adaptive capacity of users who are currently engaged in conflicts over access to natural resources. Similar to other studies, we find that expansion of farmland and the consequent loss of pastoral space are restricting pastoral adaptation. Divergent adaptations favoring agricultural livelihoods include cultivating near or around pastoral wells or within pastoral corridors, both of which limit the mobility and entitlements of pastoralists. Institutions rarely secure pastoral routes and access to water points, a problem that is compounded by conflicting modes of governance, low accountability, and corruption. The case study illustrates the need to enhance the adaptive capacity of multiple user groups to reduce conflict, enhance human security, and promote overall resilience. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Re-creating the commons and re-configuring Maasai women's roles on the rangelands in the face of fragmentation,"Throughout the world pastoralists today face a particularly daunting challenge of intensified rangeland fragmentation combined with human population growth and climate change. In many pastoral settings, rangelands are undergoing processes of fragmentation due to tenure transformations, as previously communal lands are privatized into individual holdings. Such processes of enclosure have raised concerns over the long-term costs on pastoral communities and on rangeland eco-systems. This paper explores pastoral responses and adaptations to enclosure based on long-term ethnographic engagement in a Maasai community in Southern Kenya that has recently privatized. Detailed family case studies and herd tracking illuminate the ways in which families try to re-create the commons by relying on social networks for free access to resources. In particular, women's social networks (for example, their kin, affines, friends, or religious associates) seem to play an important role. This paper calls attention to the need to better understand women's changing roles in pastoral governance and production and the implications these new roles have for women's well-being and for pastoralism in the face of fragmentation.",0.5,0.44169210596582686,0.10767137446002727,0.5651511525689666,0.06790913537879681,0.04335765837600825,0.14522521683159748
SADC's response to climate change - the role of harmonised law and policy on mitigation in the energy sector,"The negligible levels of energy-related GHG emissions attributable to the Southern African sub-region translates into the sub-region contributing relatively little towards global climate change. Notwithstanding, the member states comprising the Southern African Development Community (SADC) are among the most vulnerable to the trans boundary effects of global climate change. Existing SADC climate change policy documents highlight the important role of the energy sector in climate change mitigation. Furthermore, various international, African Union and SADC legal instruments stress the crucial role of harmonised law and policy as climate change adaptive measure. It is the central hypothesis of this paper that harmonised sub-regional law and policy aimed at regulating SADC member states' mitigation efforts in the energy sector is a crucial climate change adaptive strategy. This hypothesis is based on the mandates for the formulation of a SADC climate change action plan and for mitigation in the energy sector. These mandates are contained in the texts of the SADC-CNGO Climate Change Agenda, 2012 and the Southern Africa Sub - Regional Framework on Climate Change, 2010 respectively. It is the main aim of this paper to investigate recent developments in the formulation of harmonised SADC law and policy on climate change in general and law and policy pertaining to mitigation in the energy sector specifically. In achieving the stated aim, themes to be investigated by means of a literature study are those of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change and harmonised sub-regional policy on mitigation in the energy sector as adaptive measure in the SADC.",0.40724679777880574,0.3427960769773651,0.14580101573237078,0.2949220572683268,0.0808788355387275,0.11762123101899327,0.08949381239074594
Impact of climate change on community health and resilience in Ethiopia: A review article,"BACKGROUND: Drought is a serious issue which might be caused by climate change that could create famine and health problems. Drought reduces air quality, increases fungal infestation, reduces people hand washing, affects mental health, leads to malnutrition by decreasing agricultural production, and increases diseases transmitted by insects. This study aimed to determine and describe community health status through building drought resilience in Ethiopia.; METHODS: This review was conducted based on the available peer-reviewed articles that were published from January 2004 to December 2018 Online databases from PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched for studies related to the building drought and community health resilience at different regions of Ethiopia that were published in English language. The search was made by using ""Emergency disaster"", ""prevention"", ""preparedness"", ""response"", ""recovery"", ""drought"", ""food insecurity"", ""coping strategies"" and ""drought health policy"" as keywords.; RESULTS: Most of the reviewed articles deal with the impact of climate change on the human health in relation to food security. The associated factors of the impact of drought on food security is basically due to lack of irrigation and farmland, the scarcity of water due to the direct effect of drought, flood, severe soil erosion, livestock dispossession, family size of the household and literacy of the households. Various coping strategies were employed by the households to alleviate the high and continued food insecurity problem such as reducing the number and amount of meal, scrounging cash and grain, searching for off-farm and non-farm jobs, getting food aid, vending of livestock, and partake in food for work programs.; CONCLUSION: The findings explored components of the coping strategies to the building resilience create fruitful health conditions for the food insecure household. The effect of agricultural support services as reliance's on drought and community health situation was regarded as a positive outcome. Moreover, the means to get adequate food security strategies in all regions of Ethiopia should be designed. Furthermore, future researches are recommended for finding the best building strategies for each region of Ethiopia.",0.863247240914708,0.3395865269882165,0.0728687630523835,0.5204677387821991,0.0070975590174894646,0.026133692399776132,0.10764923750276655

"""In common nature"": an ethnography of climate adaptation in the Lesotho Highlands","In Lesotho, climate change adaptation funding is being managed and distributed by the same mechanisms which have traditionally operationalised humanitarian aid and international development assistance in the country. Lessons from the HIV/AIDS disaster, along with insights into the value of participatory approaches foregrounding the expertise of indigenous communities, must be heeded in order to ensure that those most affected by climate change have a say in how adaptation is carried out. This paper proposes that indigenous people have developed and actively maintained resilience strategies, encoded in social practices and farming techniques, designed out of long experience with climatic variability. Through case studies, indigenous resilience strategies are explored, with emphasis on the anarchistic, improvisational nature of traditional ecological knowledge. Future directions for policy-makers and practitioners dealing with climate change adaptation are suggested, namely the need to foreground indigenous knowledge and the experiences of frontlines experts in key policy arenas.",0.4913818559694174,0.48260672199613475,0.12028026952258135,0.4433840972209082,0.08569461780713314,0.0813767040988928,0.20115510402007253
"The timing of agricultural production in hazard-prone areas to prevent losses at peak-risk periods: A case of Malawi, Madagascar and Mozambique","Hazard-prone areas in southern Africa experience many natural hazards, which include cyclones, floods and droughts. The severe climatic conditions of southern Africa have an especially large impact on the agricultural practices of small-scale farmers. These hazards should be mitigated to ensure more resilient communities and food security. This study mainly focuses on the timing of agricultural production in hazard-prone areas to prevent losses at peak-risk periods by adapting the agricultural cycle. This study focuses on the agricultural activities of small-scale farmers in Malawi, Madagascar and Mozambique. A literature review is presented, and a mixed-method research design were followed to determine the timing of production followed by these small-scale farmers and its impact on production and food security. Although this study found that the small-scale farmers generally plant with the first rains, it is recommended by literature that early planting should be practised to ensure optimal production. It is also recommended that small-scale farmers should implement water-management techniques for dry periods, and when farmers practice late planting, the use of residual-moisture retention should be utilised as a mitigation measure. This will in effect ensure that the communities are less vulnerable during peak-risk periods by improving or ensuring food security. Therefore, adapting the planting and production time in these hazard-prone areas at peak-risk periods could limit losses and increase communities' resilience.",0.9636531933920345,0.18581160002161065,0.05253407920557543,0.5506353566425727,0.03918535829412633,0.031043404584896545,0.09051448707988859
Climate Change Adaptation and Water Policy: Lessons from Singapore,"Asian countries with large populations concentrated in coastal cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts, such as sea level rise. This, in turn, can adversely affect water resources as a result of flooding, coastal erosion, water scarcity etc. Singapore has been hailed for its progressive water policies and practices, which were developed to overcome its natural resource disadvantage (limited resource base) and to achieve self-sufficiency. Certainly, Singapore's geopolitical situation may have provided an atmosphere conducive to the development of progressive policies; however, it is worth exploring how Singapore is preparing for climate change adaptation, as this may allow other cities/countries to learn from Singapore's experience. The paper evaluates the contribution of Singapore's water policies and practices to climate change adaptation, and examines whether they can support the development of adaptation strategies in the water sector for other similarly situated cities in vulnerable countries.

Nomads' indigenous knowledge and their adaptation to climate changes in Semirom City in Central Iran,"Herding-based livelihood is a traditional production system in arid and semi-arid areas characterized by a dynamic and flexible self-adapting structure to adjust to unpredictable climate changes and unfavorable natural conditions. In this case, indigenous knowledge and information systems play a pivotal role in linking such structures to changing conditions. Taking such role into account, an attempt was made to investigate the nomadic knowledge of local people residing in summer rangelands of Semirom Township in Isfahan Province, Iran, gained in response to climate change. A cluster sampling procedure was used to extract the case study population from a number of nearly 7700 Qashqai nomads divided into four, Dare shoori, Amale, Shesh blocki, and Farsimdan, clans in which grazing systems were recognized as clusters or sampling units. In-depth group interviewing and exploratory methods were then used to assess the role of nomadic indigenous knowledge and insights into utilization of summer rangelands gained on adaptation to climate change and data collected from interviews were analyzed using content analysis. The results showed that people of Qashqai tribes have a thorough knowledge of climate change and have adopted long-term adaptive solutions such as building cement-block houses and water storage ponds as well as changing the migration routes and locations to cope with the adverse consequences of climate change.",0.7151045628252689,0.3697336532251787,0.09711035385345598,0.42031813348651725,0.052776291783331104,0.03224496043356432,0.0881598812405709
Limits to Climate Change Adaptation: Case Study of the Australian Alps,"Climate change is occurring and not being mitigated, motivating adaptation but adaptation strategies can have biophysical, economic, technological, and social limits. We review publicly available documents to assess how successful current and proposed adaptation strategies may be for the Australian Alps, including likely limits and potential collaborations and conflicts among stakeholders. Conservation managers, the tourism industry, and local communities have implemented or are proposing a range of adaptation strategies in the region. Some stakeholder strategies complement each other (e.g. invasive species control, fire management), while others are potential sources of conflict (water and electricity for snowmaking, year-round tourism). Economic costs and biophysical constraints are the most important limits to these adaptation strategies. These types of limits and conflicts between different stakeholders on adaptation strategies are likely to occur in other regions and demonstrate that adaptation may only provide partial and short term solutions to the challenges of climate change.",0.4613217124292195,0.3201099219723387,0.19741957743989327,0.3728884668957922,0.08646255401185873,0.0971581643581396,0.127556889911536
Agro-Biodiversity Management: Using Indigenous Knowledge to Cope with Climate Change in the Middle-Hills of Nepal,"A survey was conducted to explore people's indigenous knowledge in assessing the management and farming tactics of agro-biodiversity as adaptation strategies to climate change impacts on farms in the Pokhare Khola watershed in the Middle-Hills of Nepal. People observed the effects of decreasing rainfall, prolonged air temperature with intensity, short and warm winter with insufficient post-monsoon rainfall, and seasonal changes in rainfall patterns. Indigenous management techniques involved the modification of cropping pattern and season, introduction of new farming strategy (over 95 % farmers), approaching irrigation, and managing water from spring, wells, and carrying water from long distant area. The interchanged pattern (paddy-vegetables-paddy) from previous pattern and new introduced pattern (paddy-vegetables-fallow) were documented as popular in leveled terraced fields (khet). During survey in 2010, maize-vegetables pattern has become adapted instead of maize-millet pattern in around the homestead areas (bari). People perceived that short winter with insufficient rain declined wheat (Triticum aestivum) and changed annual rainfall pattern and water shortage lowered the millet (Elusine coracana) production. The use of improved varieties of plants, goat keeping, and planting fodder trees on bari were also perceived as coping strategy. © 2014 NAAS (National Academy of Agricultural Sciences).",0.9315210561858359,0.17025272720663756,0.12642275398637845,0.4148937253991612,0.013246148795889624,0.022952850034927426,0.12351122133259375
Reducing risks by transforming landscapes: Cross-scale effects of land-use changes on ecosystem services,"Globally, anthropogenic environmental change is exacerbating the already vulnerable conditions of many people and ecosystems. In order to obtain food, water, raw materials and shelter, rural people modify forests and other ecosystems, affecting the supply of ecosystem services that contribute to livelihoods and well-being. Despite widespread awareness of the nature and extent of multiple impacts of land-use changes, there remains limited understanding of how these impacts affect trade-offs among ecosystem services and their beneficiaries across spatial scales. We assessed how rural communities in two forested landscapes in Indonesia have changed land uses over the last 20 years to adapt their livelihoods that were at risk from multiple hazards. We estimated the impact of these adaptation strategies on the supply of ecosystem services by comparing different benefits provided to people from these land uses (products, water, carbon, and biodiversity), using forest inventories, remote sensing, and interviews. Local people converted forests to rubber plantations, reforested less productive croplands, protected forests on hillsides, and planted trees in gardens. Our results show that land-use decisions were propagated at the landscape scale due to reinforcing loops, whereby local actors perceived that such decisions contributed positively to livelihoods by reducing risks and generating co-benefits. When land-use changes become sufficiently widespread, they affect the supply of multiple ecosystem services, with impacts beyond the local scale. Thus, adaptation implemented at the local-scale may not address development and climate adaptation challenges at regional or national scale (e.g. as part of UN Sustainable Development Goals or actions taken under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement). A better understanding of the context and impacts of local ecosystem-based adaptation is fundamental to the scaling up of land management policies and practices designed to reduce risks and improve well-being for people at different scales.",0.5935999780294889,0.31794429430585636,0.1875293065179704,0.3953414743011774,0.07433084204791059,0.046892973562429184,0.06106619867790095
Learning the hard way: a case study of an attempt at agricultural transformation in response to climate change,"There is increasing interest in transformational adaptation to climate change in agriculture, i.e. adaptation that involves large-scale, novel responses to reduce vulnerability to climate risks. Transformational adaptation is less well understood than incremental adaptation, since there are few studies of agricultural enterprises making transformative changes in response to climatic change. This paper is an in-depth study of an agricultural company's attempt to implement transformational adaptation in response to climate change. We document the Peanut Company of Australia's (PCA) response to predicted climatic change by expanding its operations into Katherine, Northern Territory, after decades of below-average rainfall in their traditional production region in south-east Queensland. Our research question was: what conditions and processes influenced the outcome of the company's response? We conducted 37 semi-structured interviews with company, government and community representatives to examine diverse perspectives on PCA's expansion into Katherine and its subsequent strategic retreat. To reveal insights into why, when and how this attempted transformational adaptation occurred we reviewed the literature and identified Park et al.'s (2012) Adaptation Action Cycles (AAC) framework and aspects from the organisational adaptation literature as useful for our analysis. Based on our findings, we revised the AAC framework to better reflect the way that incremental adaptation in situ can occur simultaneously with transformational adaptation at a new location. Our study illustrates that transformational adaptation in agriculture is difficult, complex, risky and costly and sometimes unsuccessful, revealing some of the challenges of and barriers to organisational adaptation in agriculture, especially when moving to a new location.",0.596389945238562,0.3595929709091443,0.15485572821708377,0.3457240908735827,0.08833265638352597,0.08211285374031602,0.06189419087237077
Ethnobotanical study of traditional edible plants used by the Naxi people during droughts,"Background: Since 2009, millions of people have been forced to live under food shortage by the continuous drought in Southwestern China. The market was the primary source of aid grains, and fears that the market will be unable to provide sufficient food make safeguarding food security in the face of climate change crucial. Traditional adaptive strategies of pre-market indigenous people are a potential source of innovation. We studied three questions among the Naxi people: 1) What edible plants did they consume during droughts? 2) How did they produce enough food? 3) How did they consume these plants? This study investigates and documents traditional Naxi food knowledge to safeguard food security during drought and facilitate Chinese policy decisions. Methods: Ethnobotanical investigation was conducted through literature review, semi-structured interviews, collaborative fieldwork and group discussions in three Naxi villages. 89 informants (including 35 key informants) were surveyed from 2012 to 2013. Significant Index (SI) was adopted to evaluate each edible plant's food supply significance. Voucher specimens were collected for taxonomic identification. Results: 1) In total, 141 edible plants (38 cultivated and 103 wild) were consumed-primarily landrace crops, supplementary edible plants and famine plants. 2) Naxi people produced sufficient food through widespread food production systems, strong landrace crop resilience, and diversity in wild edible plants. 3) Through a diverse diet and consuming almost all edible parts of the plant, the Naxi used edible plants fully to meet food and nutrition needs during drought. Conclusions: Edible plant diversity is a cornerstone of drought food security. Cultivated crops (especially landrace plants) and wild edible plants were both important. Naxi people protect edible plant diversity through ecological morality and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). National inventories of edible plant diversity and studies of the TEK of other Chinese indigenous peoples should be undertaken to inform sustainable food policy decisions in China.",0.9024433306643102,0.2751480270955603,0.10877858999147004,0.5301827079155448,0.035711182813458066,0.02597270893967851,0.08410233037719254
Adaptive flood mobilities in Bangladesh,"Global climate change has altered the efficacy of traditional responses to flooding in Bangladesh and has necessitated the adoption of new actions, social networks and mobilities to strengthen the ongoing viability of the community. These changes need to be accompanied by appropriate government responses. We examined these changing mobilities in Bangladesh by first classifying them according to the relevant characteristics of emergency mobilities as described by Adey (anticipation, coordination, absence and difference) and then applying, as appropriate, one or more of Sheller and Urry's six essential bodies of mobility theory to provide a dynamic analysis from which to generate policy responses. Major findings specific to Bangladesh include the criticality of social networks and the mobility of gender roles due to flood-related migration. The policy implications, situated at the confluence of cultural tradition, the imperative to survive and current government policy which does not encourage mobility, focus on reconceptualising the use of land space to envisage a new paradigm of support for emergency mobility and resourcing people movement. Future research could apply this novel data analysis approach to other migration situations, with the purpose of informing emergency mobility policy.",0.2599528586388023,0.4496895341003875,0.10074359338318874,0.4273658278384706,0.10980192404058764,0.14078208817807447,0.12355914492750417
Maintaining the human-natural systems of pastoralism in the himalayas of South Asia and China,"This chapter presents an overview of pastoralism in the Himalayas and summarizes the current situation and trends of human-natural systems of pastoralism in the Nepalese Himalaya, in the Indian Himalaya, and on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China. The human-natural system of pastoralism has lasted in a relatively stable manner for centuries in the Himalayas, especially through flexible responses to the variability of climate conditions in the short term. However, a great number of external and internal driving forces are currently threatening the sustainability of the long-term nature of pastoralism. They complicate interactions and feedbacks between human and natural components of pastoralism in coping with the stresses, and the integration of various tools and strategies from the ecological and social sciences as well as other disciplines in sustainable pastoral development. In the Himalayan region of northern Nepal, local institutions of collective action and indigenous property right systems for pastoral resource management are the key adaptive strategies to overcome the difficulties in pastoral management associated with poor cooperation and collaboration between the government and the pastoral society. In the Indian Himalaya, well-organized local institutions and commonly agreed norms and rules among the pastoral societies have promoted the sustainable use of pastoral resources in coping with pressures and threats of climatic, socioeconomic, and political changes. On the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China, local pastoralists have developed adaptive actions of mobility, specificity, preparedness, diversification, exchange, collaboration, and partnership based on their knowledge and wisdom to cope with rangeland degradation driven by climate change and human overexploitation. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",0.6195672161116201,0.33466445987045035,0.18232606573676033,0.47149475820841225,0.05782823108799975,0.026416474005114005,0.19790291573408747
Livelihood vulnerability to drought: A case of rural Iran,"Agriculture as the main source of livelihood for rural residents of the developing countries is inherently sensitive to climate variability and change. Among different climatic events, drought is frequently identified as a major threat to agricultural systems and livelihood security of farm families, in many arid and semi-arid regions of the developing world. The negative impacts of drought are further intensified by the threat of climate change. In order to mitigate the negative impacts of drought on livelihood, increasing adaptive capacity of farm families is imperative. If rural livelihoods are no longer secure, farm families are finally forced to abandon agriculture. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the livelihood vulnerability of farm families to drought. It was also intended to determine the drivers of livelihood vulnerability in the context of drought. A survey of 274 farm families of Fars province, selected through a multistage stratified random sampling technique, indicated that drought is the main threat to livelihood security meantime the interaction between drought intensity and its duration leads to more vulnerability. Additionally, results revealed that different adaptation strategies were used by the low, medium and high livelihood vulnerable families in order to adjust drought impacts. Tree analysis also illustrated that livelihood vulnerability is a product of the complex set of financial, physical, social and natural capitals. Some recommendations are offered to reduce the livelihood vulnerability of farm families to drought.",0.9551161142331083,0.28355989628461936,0.08509158281420436,0.6821436892399738,0.021761285058700827,0.01595665307594477,0.07862545567929095
Climate-related migration in rural Bangladesh: a behavioural model,"Research into the climate change and migration nexus has often focussed solely on how people move in response to the impacts of variability and change in climate. This notion often ignores the nature of migration as a tried and tested livelihood choice amid a variety of socio-economic and environmental opportunities and limitations. This paper closely looks at the behavioural aspects of migration decision-making in Bangladesh in the context of changes in its economy, and, increasingly, exposure to the impacts of climate variability and change. We find that villagers in areas particularly affected by increasing climatic stresses and shocks are diversifying their traditional livelihood strategies by migrating. Environmental factors, including climatic stresses and shocks, often make such shifts even more necessary. Although the migrants' primary motivation is better income, in effect, migration becomes an effective form of adaptation. Based on a qualitative study in three geographically distinct places of Bangladesh, we propose that migration is a socially acceptable behaviour that occurs in the context of perceived environmental change and climate variability. Migration decisions are mediated by a set of 'behavioural factors' that assesses the efficacy of different responses to opportunities and challenges, their socio-cultural acceptance and the ability to respond successfully. This understanding has policy relevance for climate change adaptation, in terms of both how migrants are perceived and how their movements are planned for.",0.35927515990353687,0.4609129963464058,0.09029901591162368,0.6659045038145025,0.11369345709989422,0.04234164475487553,0.020572236755159748
"High mountain communities and climate change: adaptation, traditional ecological knowledge, and institutions","Our planet has already committed to climate change and will experience its associated impacts; thus, mitigation along with adaptation strategies cannot be mutually exclusive. Yet, international and national policies to tackle climate change have focused more on mitigation than adaptation. On the other hand, indigenous communities have been continuously adapting to environmental stresses for millennia, including more recent cascading impacts of climate change. Indigenous communities have developed a wealth of information in the form of their traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), based on their observations of the obvious linkages between changing climatic conditions and biodiversity. Here, I hypothesize that in harsh environments such as the alpine Himalaya, social systems particularly local institutions that are largely based on TEK are important in improving adaptive capacity by providing social, economic, and ecological security to the community. I provide an insight into the adaptation strategies of two communities that inhabit the alpine zones of the Sikkim Himalaya, in India. We address two broad questions: (1) How are indigenous communities in the vulnerable alpine zones of the Himalaya adapting to the complex challenges posed by climate change particularly in conjunction with their indigenous governing institution? We give examples of adaptation strategies and broadly categorize them into six groups, namely (a) Institutional capital, (b) Rationing, (c) Forecasting, (d) Mobility, (e) Economic diversification, and (f) Communal pooling. (2) How can TEK be integrated with climate change sciences for improving data availability and better policy? I conclude with a framework that uses a holistic approach complementing the rigor of science with the wealth of TEK to suggest pathways for improved policy response to climate change.",0.6560271334649027,0.3949759127505764,0.21784198253107187,0.5,0.09970451312580743,0.05443913411897012,0.05490323858584342
Climate change impact in the Western Himalaya: people's perception and adaptive strategies,"The Himalaya represents a vast mountain system and globally valued for its significant role in regulation of global as well as regional climate that has direct impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services crucial for sustenance of millions of people in Himalaya and adjoining areas. However, mountain regions worldwide are impacted by climate change and at the same time represent distinctive area for the assessment of climate related impacts. Climate change impacts in Himalayan region have its implications on food production, natural ecosystems, retreat of glacier, water supply, human and animal health and overall human well being. The livelihood and food security of the people inhabited in region largely depend on climate sensitive sectors i.e. agriculture, livestock, forestry and their interlinkages with each other, and has the potential to break down food and nutritional security as well as livelihood support systems. People's perception and understanding of climate can be an important asset when it comes to adaptation to climate change impact; however it is not taken into consideration for the development of policy design and implementation of modern mitigation and adaptation strategies by governments and other civil society organizations. The knowledge of local people and farming communities for rural landscape management and sustainable use of bioresources is gaining credence as a key strategy to cope up with the climate change. Therefore, the present study analyzes the indigenous knowledge of local people and their perceptions on climate change, and also documented adaptation approaches at local level in mountain ecosystem of western Himalaya. The study could be useful to policy makers to design appropriate adaptation strategies to cope up with the impacts of climate change.",0.758120227893844,0.30441988700219014,0.13124807577868386,0.4429979289218509,0.041626978374940525,0.05555409421219149,0.06168777741167356
Local agriculture traditional knowledge to ensure food availability in a changing climate: revisiting water management practices in the Indo-Gangetic Plains,"Climate variations are considered one of several interacting factors affecting food security. Specifically, in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, increased exposure to droughts and floods are expected. Local traditional knowledge in agriculture (LTKA) is proposed in this article as valid knowledge to ensure food availability under climate change, given its long experience in dealing with climate variability. Focused on water strategies, we have conducted a literature review on LTKA practices in the Indo-Gangetic Plains complemented with a questionnaire of experts to identify LTKA-based practices that might be useful in climate-change driven water scenarios. The practices identified are categorized as a) water harvesting and recycling; b) local irrigation systems; and c) and maintenance, conservation, and water allocation. We found that a) despite acknowledging the potential of LTKA to face floods and droughts, very few studies explicitly make the link between LTKA and climate change; and b) LTKA in water management heavily relays on social norms and local institutions and, thus, any attempts to replicate it need to consider this. We conclude that agroecology can help to promote these practices since it emphasizes the collective management from below as the main approach for the design of sustainable agroecosystems and, thus, include local institutions as an essential strategy for adaptation.",0.7961000716987588,0.24940220149128195,0.20629886060463232,0.28749979983096985,0.05013760973321988,0.06745679239377071,0.3703218413359396

Adaptation to Climate Change in Industry: Improving Resource Efficiency through Sustainable Production Applications,"The objective of this study was to investigate the climate change adaptation opportunities of six companies from different sectors through resource efficiency and sustainable production. A total of 77 sustainable production options were developed for the companies based on the audits conducted. After screening these opportunities with each company's staff, 19 options were selected and implemented. Significant water savings (849,668 m(3)/year) were achieved as a result of the applications that targeted reduction of water use. In addition to water savings, the energy consumption was reduced by 3,607 MWh, which decreased the CO2 emissions by 904.1 tons/year. Moreover, the consumption of 278.4 tons/year of chemicals (e.g., NaCl, CdO, NaCN) was avoided, thus the corresponding pollution load to the wastewater treatment plant was reduced. Besides the tangible improvements, other gains were achieved, such as improved product quality, improved health and safety conditions, reduced maintenance requirements, and ensured compliance with national and EU regulations. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first ever activity in Turkey devoted to climate change adaptation in the private sector. This study may serve as a building block in Turkey for the integration of climate change adaptation and mitigation approach in the industry, since water efficiency (adaptation) and carbon reduction (mitigation) are achieved simultaneously.",0.44727474999896305,0.29558065541340467,0.14017305471515373,0.2529683922012713,0.049312452078571045,0.16163252832454564,0.15305901934000485
Policy recommendations to increase urban heat stress resilience,"As the frequency and intensity of heatwaves are growing, strategies to improve our resilience are becoming more vital. Policies to increase heat stress resilience are mostly isolated across different disciplines and government departments. A holistic approach would be necessary that mitigates the numerous negative impacts of heatwaves on public health, urban infrastructure and services through adaptation to heatwaves in the realm of public health, building and construction industry, and urban planning and infrastructure. This paper reviews the research on heat stress adaptation measures, before presenting recommendations for a range of integrated policy measures to increase the heat stress resilience of urban populations in Australian cities. The recommended policy measures include information dissemination, incentives and disincentives, promotion, demonstration and regulations. The paper concludes by identifying directions for further research and reinforcing the multiple benefits that can result from the implementation of heat stress resilience policies and strategies.",0.0724053190745468,0.4767969792770416,0.03819048763191866,0.11501678123386314,0.03707114788753622,0.6802495829214054,0.08428838427035129
Planned sheltering as an adaptation strategy to climate change: Lessons learned from the severe flooding in Anhui Province of China in 2016,"Background: Evacuation and sheltering is both a disaster response measure and a strategy to adapt to climate change, and consequently address the Sustainable Development Goals. Research has found that displacement does cause negative health impacts to evacuees, but few studies have observed how planned sheltering might reduce adverse health impacts. This article identifies the good practice and lessons learned from China's response to severe flooding in Anhui province in 2016. Methods: First, we identified the key phases for disaster sheltering by analyzing related government reports. We then interviewed 21 relevant professionals in order to identify good practice and lessons learned which could lead to better health outcomes (e.g., reduce fatalities, infectious diseases, and mental health problems). Interviewees were selected through a purposive sampling strategy, which identified emergency management professionals and those who had been assigned evacuation, sheltering, or medical tasks. Finally, thematic analysis and the constant comparative method were used to code, identify, and describe the good practice and challenges during key phases. Results: Good practice included: using early warning systems to advise communities of risks and enforce evacuation in the flood zone; preparing and using schools as shelters with open-ended periods of operation; and, providing stable shelter accommodations which offered medical and public health services, clean drinking water and food, sanitation, and toilet hygiene through multiagency cooperation. Challenges included: providing mental health services, evaluating intervention effectiveness, managing volunteers, monitoring long-term health effects, and providing economic support. Conclusions: The unintended negative effects caused by sheltering during extreme weather can be reduced. This requires close cooperation among government entities to establish planned mass shelters with appropriate levels of personal, environmental and healthcare support and to ensure long-term physical and mental health support. Additionally, if disaster mitigation strategies are integrated with climate adaptation plans, we can design more health-oriented and sustainable cities.

Should I stay or should I go? Fishers' ability and willingness to adapt to environmental change in Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake,"The livelihoods of people dependent on the Tonle Sap floodplain ecosystem in Cambodia are expected to be affected by changes in economic conditions, social circumstances, environmental perturbations, demographic shifts and political climates. This study assesses how small-scale fisheries' livelihoods are changing in response to social and environmental conditions using the opinions of fishers collected through an intensive family survey of 514 households from Pursat and Battambang Provinces in Cambodia. Probit modelling approach was used to assess whether a fisher would continue fishing or not in the future when subjected to a variety of shifting conditions and identify the factors associated with their response. It was found that in any future condition about 50% of fishers would likely continue to fish, which suggests how much they love their traditional livelihood of fishing. The remaining 50% considered to diversify their livelihood strategy by shifting towards a combination of fishing, farming, and off-farm jobs. Furthermore, the analysis found that the fishers will change their fishing practices depending on how other sectors in the region develop. The model showed increasing access to agricultural activities decreased the likelihood of continuing to fish, whereas finding an off-farm job corresponded to increased likelihood of continuing to fish.",0.8375950043417073,0.3088526758526427,0.10387312226382832,0.637583260329912,0.2763933850121505,0.014185743956784591,0.01830096538002782
Governing Climate Change Risks: Subnational Climate Policies in Brazil,"Subnational governments play a key role producing responses to climate change risks involving policy strategies and instruments. This article analyzes how Brazilian municipal and state governments have developed and implemented climate change mitigation and adaptation public policies. We surveyed all cities' and states' climate policies within the country. The methodological approach includes five main points of analysis: (1) mitigation targets and intentions; (2) adaptation actions; (3) stakeholders' participation; (4) policy implementation; (5) participation in climate change transnational networks. Our results showed that even though subnational climate policies are isolated initiatives in the country, they are relevant initiatives to respond to climate change risks in different scales and levels. The solidest subnational policies emerged where there were previous institutional arrangements related to climate change including the participation of several stakeholders. Such governments have also joined transnational climate change cooperation networks.",0.23024055170469315,0.37844678673488896,0.14970275586678583,0.30726638740724926,0.08423482797887707,0.17610140068829327,0.07470307208112296
"Adapting to Variable Water Supply in the Truckee-Carson River System, Western USA","In snow-fed inland river systems in the western United States, water supply depends upon timing, form, and amount of precipitation. In recent years, this region has experienced unprecedented drought conditions due to decreased snowpack, exacerbated by exceptionally warmer winter temperatures averaging 3-4 degrees C above normal. In the snow-fed Truckee-Carson River System, two sets of interviews were conducted as part of a larger collaborative modeling case study with local water managers to examine local adaptation to current drought conditions. A comparative analysis of these primary qualitative data, collected during the fourth and fifth consecutive years of continued warmer drought conditions, identifies shifts in adaptation strategies and emergent adaptation barriers. That is, under continuous exposure to climate stressors, managers shifted their adaptation focus from short-term efforts to manage water demand toward long-term efforts to enhance water supply. Managers described the need to: improve forecasts and scientific assessments of snowmelt timing, groundwater levels, and soil moisture content; increase flexibility of prior appropriation water allocation rules based on historical snowpack and streamflow timing; and foster collaboration and communication among water managers across the river system. While water scarcity and insufficient water delivery infrastructure remain significant impediments in this arid region, climate uncertainty emerged as a barrier surrounding adaptation to variable water supply. Existing prior appropriation based water institutions were also described as an adaptation barrier, meriting objective evaluation to assess how to best modify these historical institutions to support dynamic adaptation to climate-induced water supply variability. This study contributes to a growing body of research that assesses drought adaptation in snow-fed inland river systems, and contributes a unique report concerning how adaptation strategies and barriers encountered by local water managers change over time under continuous exposure to climate stressors. These locally identified adaptation strategies forward a larger collaborative modeling case study by informing alternative water management scenarios simulated through a suite of hydrologic and operations models tailored to this river system.",0.6375783826068188,0.24298257284044206,0.2440944178453732,0.22074745216128314,0.06026451852368426,0.10093830629912434,0.9461590441316443
Water conservation benefits of urban heat mitigation,"Many cities globally are seeking strategies to counter the consequences of both a hotter and drier climate. While urban heat mitigation strategies have been shown to have beneficial effects on health, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, their implications for water conservation have not been widely examined. Here we use a suite of satellite-supported regional climate simulations in California to show that broad implementation of cool roofs, a heat mitigation strategy, not only results in significant cooling, but can also meaningfully decrease outdoor water consumption by reducing evaporative and irrigation water demands. Irrigation water consumption across the major metropolitan areas is reduced by up to 9% and irrigation water savings per capita range from 1.8 to 15.4 gallons per day across 18 counties examined. Total water savings are found to be the highest in Los Angeles county, reaching about 83 million gallons per day. Cool roofs are a valuable solution for addressing the adaptation and mitigation challenges faced by multiple sectors in California.",0.4204815740733008,0.2981166531060371,0.15397205459677452,0.1988914323941944,0.059937478154568805,0.2898369346427968,0.3988675987634451
From Permafrost to Sunny Beaches Lessons Learned from Alaska and Southeast Florida Climate Adaptation Studies,"This paper examines two climate adaptation assessment studies conducted in significantly different climates Alaska and southeast Florida. The purpose of the studies was to identify areas of commonality between the two studies with respect to the assessment steps, tools used, and the types of strategies and actions recommended. Four topics were identified for the assessment: forecasting future climate conditions, identifying impacts and disruptions, identifying adaptation strategies and options, and considering risks and uncertainties and the implications for engineering design. The paper concludes that the use of surrogate approaches for considered environmental conditions can be a valuable tool for those conducting adaptation assessment studies. Data quality was an important concern in both studies, and adaptation strategies should include both those designed to avoid damage and disruption and those designed to mitigate any potential consequence of an event. A broader concept of loss should be incorporated into the assessment process and into the engineering decisions relating to individual project designs.",0.41340300878680236,0.3653968885695354,0.10773525811421138,0.2889528151511113,0.08529086390393494,0.15263272323845256,0.07848774644509816
Resilience strategies in the face of short- and long-term change: out-migration and fisheries regulation in Alaskan fishing communities,"Historically, communities persisted in remote, isolated areas of Alaska in large part because of the abundance of marine and terrestrial resources, as well as the ability of local people to opportunistically access those resources as they became available. Species switching and the ability to shift effort away from fisheries during poor years allowed local residents to diversify their livelihoods in the face of uncertainties and ecological change. The advent of modern fisheries management, which views Alaskan fisheries as the property of all citizens of the United States, has fundamentally altered the relationship of place-based communities to fishery resources. Local access to fisheries has been particularly affected by the development of transferable fishing privileges, making it possible for fishing rights to leave place-based communities through the choices of individual community members to sell or to move away. When fishing communities in Alaska lose active fishing businesses, over time the loss of various types of community capital will follow, including human, social, cultural, technical, and financial capital. In some cases, communities are able to adapt or transform through diversification of their local economies. In other cases, no alternatives to a fishery-based economy are accessible. We have used resilience theory to explore drivers of change affecting Alaskan fishing communities. Emphasis was placed on two primary change drivers, the regulatory environment and rural out-migration, as well as their interconnections and their impacts on individuals, communities, and the larger social-ecological system. We summarized several government programs that have been implemented to support the continued participation of communities in Alaskan fisheries. In addition, we reviewed informal and private-sector efforts to generate resilience strategies that can facilitate new entry into fisheries or retain fishing businesses and fishing rights within communities, as well as respond to increasing uncertainty related to the global market and climate changes.",0.4896591432025118,0.4809359682308248,0.13671430063021411,0.48484620304511333,0.4114525189693094,0.060078219809112814,0.1247709226188379
The climate adaptation imperative: local choices targeting global problems?,"When confronted with the demands of global climate change, what causes some policy-makers to move the climate adaptation agenda forward in their communities, while others seemingly get little accomplished? To answer this question, we first discuss work on policy-drivers in a coupled human-natural systemic context. This summary review of past research helps us develop a set of competing and complementary explanations for why some communities aggressively pursue climate adaptation policies, while others do less. Following the discussion of policy-drivers, we then undertake an aggregate-level analysis of data collected across the 169 towns in Connecticut regarding climate adaptation, thus linking policy to its fundamental global cause. The quantitative data are augmented with interview data from policy-makers and activists from around the New England region.",0.4478721762742038,0.41542196869778025,0.11908548061939177,0.359503959862264,0.07360674882256459,0.1618307833624148,0.12633371775274288
"Agricultural adaptation to changing environments: Lessons learned from farmers in eastern Ontario, Canada","Agriculture exists in dynamic environments where change is normal. All facets of agri-food systems are constantly exposed to these changes and, when necessary, make adjustments. This study builds on our growing understanding of farm-level adaptations in uncertain environments. It grapples with agriculture change in general and, more specifically, framing climatic change adaptation within the complex and dynamic environments that farmers negotiate on a daily basis. Engagement with the farming community was in conjunction with the Dundas County Federation of Agriculture, occurred during 2009-2013, and included the co-hosting of two focus group meetings plus the administration of 42 in-depth interviews. Many changes in Dundas County over the past 30 years mirror broader sectoral trends, including a decline in the number of farms (-40%) coupled with increases in farm size (+61%) and the age of farm operators (+14%). One significant difference however is that farming continues to be the main economic activity in Dundas County with only a slight decline (-3%) in the overall area devoted to farming. The continued strength of farming reflects the willingness and ability of farmers to embrace technological improvements as well as consolidate farm operations in order to manage costs and buffer uncertainties. Farmers are confident they can manage anticipated changes over the next two decades but are concerned with potential negative impacts associated with more government regulations and farm succession. Climate change, especially increases in the incidence of extreme events, is viewed as another but manageable uncertainty that will need to be factored into longer-term decisions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",0.9034217784565798,0.23351511704437847,0.11924468477847135,0.46525989010479263,0.03746763684396071,0.02200482743522784,0.04642155707110505
Tracking Drought Perspectives: A Rural Case Study of Transformations Following an Invisible Hazard,"Rural towns are especially susceptible to the effects of drought because their economies are dependent on natural resources. However, they are also resilient in many ways to natural hazards because they are rich in civic engagement and social capital. Because of the diverse nature of drought's impacts, understanding its complex dynamics and its effects requires a multidisciplinary approach. To study these dynamics, this research combines appreciative inquiry, the Community Capitals Framework, and a range of climatological monitoring data to assess the 2012-14 Great Plains drought's effect on McCook, Nebraska. Community coping measures, such as water-use reduction and public health programs, were designed to address the immediate effects of heat and scant rainfall during the initial summer and the subsequent years. Residents generally reported the community was better prepared than in previous droughts, including the persistent multiyear early-2000s drought. However, the results highlight wide variation in community perspectives about the drought's severity and impacts, as well as divergent experiences and coping responses. Despite these factors, we find evidence of the transformative potential of moving from drought coping to drought mitigation. We attribute the city's resilience to the ability to draw upon prior experience with droughts, having a formal municipal plan, and strong human and social capital to coordinate individual knowledge and expertise across agencies. We suggest that droughts have served a catalytic function, prompting the community to transform land-use practices, water conservation planning, and built infrastructure in lasting ways.",0.44195469353095607,0.40020295793553856,0.13775784631303678,0.42059993978933596,0.03823770939892587,0.09931390666950286,0.5340892888925123
Environmental Harm or Natural Hazard? Problem Identification and Adaptation in US Municipal Climate Action Plans,"A number of cities in the United States have devised climate action plans (CAPs) to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, few of these plans address strategies to adapt to the long term effects of climate change that will occur in the near and distant future. The research presented in this article examines why cities choose to embed adaptation provisions in their CAPs. Our study codes the content of CAPs for all cities (N598) in the United States with populations greater than 50,000. We find cities that frame problems associated with climate change in the language of hazards are more likely to include adaptation strategies in their CAPs than cities that focus on other types of environmental harm. Our findings suggest that more robust efforts to plan for climate change will require the activation of communities of interest beyond those that have been instrumental in setting the current climate agenda.",0.20487747654739125,0.3659276774985959,0.1286360773065754,0.24926867837670755,0.0901334572069788,0.42893877301385597,0.0561470797797309
The geography of skier adaptation to adverse conditions in the Ontario ski market,"Weather and climate directly influence ski season length, the quality of snow conditions, and skier visits. Inter-annual climate variability, which is expected to become more pronounced under future climate change, poses an increased risk for the ski tourism industry. Using a survey ( n - 2448), this study examines where and how far skiers in Ontario ( Canada) are willing to travel if their ski resort was to temporarily or permanently close due to a lack of snow. The majority of respondents ( >= 59%) would travel to five key resorts in Ontario, with the largest share ( >= 27%) selecting Blue Mountain Resort. An additional 11- 15% of respondents would leave Ontario, opting to travel to Quebec or the state of New York. Overall, this paper presents the first empirical evidence on the geographical patterns skiers may engage in as a result of marginal snow conditions, in addition to providing information on travel distance and time thresholds. This research is fundamental for assessing contemporary climate risk and can inform how future climate change could alter demand patterns in regional ski marketplaces. Future research needs are identified to further appraise the consequences and future viability of individual ski resorts in Ontario and the ski industry more generally.",0.28817480634480996,0.32788990526933626,0.10143894603353457,0.23456083497284294,0.06145433143305353,0.1304879983131219,0.04537775640586112
Longitudinal assessment of climate vulnerability: a case study from the Canadian Arctic,"The Arctic is a global hotspot of climate change, which is impacting the livelihoods of remote Inuit communities. We conduct a longitudinal assessment of climate change vulnerability drawing upon fieldwork conducted in 2004 and 2015 in Ikpiarjuk (Arctic Bay), Nunavut, and focusing on risks associated with subsistence harvesting activities. Specifically, we employ the same conceptual and methodological approach to identify and characterize who is vulnerable, to what stresses, and why, assessing how this has changed over time, including re-interviewing individuals involved in the original study. We find similarities between the two periods, with many of the observed environmental changes documented in 2004 having accelerated over the last decade, exacerbating risks of land use: changing sea ice regimes and wind patterns are the most widely documented at both times, with new observations reporting more frequent sighting of polar bear and orca. Socio-economic and technological changes have altered the context in climate change impacts are being experienced and responded to, both exacerbating and moderating vulnerabilities compared to 2004. The adoption of new technology, including GPS and widespread use of the internet, has helped land users manage changing conditions while sharing networks remain strong, despite concern noted in the 2004 study that they were weakening. Challenges around access to financial resources and concern over the incomplete transmission of some environmental knowledge and land skills to younger generations continue to increase sensitivity and limit adaptive capacity to changing climatic conditions.",0.6217835456998976,0.38579038762525825,0.19451121440896602,0.4201156222762632,0.0923194031475261,0.050647495279731204,0.07949497074192288

Mainstreaming climate change adaptation into the European Union's development assistance,"This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of mainstreaming efforts regarding climate change adaptation (CCA) in EU development cooperation. By constructing and operationalising an analytical framework capable of tracing the level of mainstreaming throughout different phases of the policy cycle, we provide an answer to the question 'what works and what doesn't' in the integration of climate change in development cooperation. We combine a document analysis with semi-structured expert interviews, encompassing both HQ level in Brussels as well as EU aid activities in nine different developing countries. Our findings indicate that the Commission envisions a harmonisation approach towards CCA mainstreaming, targeting aid activities related to sustainable agriculture, food security and rural development. Although the toolbox for mainstreaming allows for a prioritisation of CCA, the procedural approach is currently ineffective due to limited staff and mainstreaming fatigue. In contrast, the growing political salience of CCA mainstreaming can be considered the main driver of mainstreaming efforts in the Commission.",0.2798562013624316,0.3300927104358803,0.13687468229671446,0.38867810830072225,0.07190222529023563,0.17703191039109664,0.10531024748371674

"Pasture access and adaptive capacity in reindeer herding districts in Nordland, Northern Norway","Resource access and livelihood flexibility have been identified in the literature as two critical determinants of adaptive capacity. This paper shows that these aspects play important roles in reindeer herding in Nordland County, Norway, in terms of resilience to changes in socialecological systems. Throughout history, reindeer herders have been able to draw on a broad range of adaptation options, but increased pasture fragmentation and loss of grazing land increasingly affect herders’ adaptability to weather variability and climate change impacts. Our analysis of empirical material from three adjacent reindeer herding districts illustrates the linkages between socio-economic and environmental exposure sensitivities, how the herders adapt by exploring patterns of differential adaptive capacity, and how adaptive capacity is impacted. Two socio-economic (pasture encroachment and insufficient human resources) and two environmental (locked pastures and predation) exposure sensitivities emerged as the most prominent affecting pasture access, which was the most critical factor for ensuring the adaptive capacity of reindeer herders. Flexibility to alternate between adaptation strategies was another important characteristic. Adapting to these exposure sensitivities engenders benefits and unintended negative consequences for the herders. The key components to adaptive capacity identified in this paper provide an evidence-based focus for management action by those seeking to improve resilience of socio-ecological systems at the community level. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group",0.5818458551649262,0.4191148920975777,0.2335977244499226,0.544669925443878,0.08001325678629329,0.0535647769537838,0.11935540664678963
Do forest decision-makers in Southeastern Norway adapt forest management to climate change?,"To study whether, why, and how forestry decision-makers in Southeastern Norway adapt to climate change, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews in focus groups consisting of non-industrial private forest owners, forest managers, and forest advisors. Our results show that a majority of the participants believed in climate change as a phenomenon, and had experienced events or observed changes that they attributed to climate change. However, we found little evidence of concern regarding climate change impacts on forest ecosystems and forestry among the participants. Instead, the majority regarded climate change more as an opportunity for the Norwegian forest-based sector than a threat. A minority had implemented proactive practices motivated by climate change but in all but one case, the adjustments were adaptation of forest infrastructure. In general, the participants agreed that the uncertainty associated with the effects of climate change and the (economical) uncertainty associated with adaptation of forest ecosystems were too large to change forest management practices at present. However, many participants, in particular the managers, are already adapting in response to experienced problems, such as increased frequency and duration of periods with low carrying capacity of the ground implying reduced or no accessibility within and to stands.",0.49436884517940866,0.29031587702009154,0.3222161126311748,0.26134808474685894,0.05165348703313492,0.03581422147243231,0.034906467248651915
"In the wake of winston – climate change, mobility and resiliency in FIJI","When tropical cyclone Winston hit Fiji on 20 February 2016, it became the strongest storm recorded in the southern hemisphere and the second strongest storm ever recorded in the world. Forty-four people died as a result of the superstorm, and the ongoing governmental recovery plans have estimated nearly three billion Fijian dollars (£1.1 billion) in damages. Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, in a national address following Winston, stated ‘almost no part of our nation has been left unscarred’. This paper explores the adaptation measures for extreme weather and climate change in Fiji following Winston, as well as the author’s experiences both as a survivor of Winston and as a volunteer aid-relief worker living in Suva, the Fijian capital, at the time of the superstorm. Notably, Winston struck 5 days after Fiji became the first nation to ratify the United Nations Climate deal agreed to by 195 nations in Paris in December 2015. Many Pacific island nations have played a vital role in leading the global dialogue on climate change. In the lead up to the Paris summit, Prime Minister Bainimarama, stressed that ‘unless the world acts decisively in the coming weeks to begin addressing the greatest challenge of our age, then the Pacific, as we know it, is doomed.’ This is undoubtedly true and a global response is desperately needed, but equally true is the importance for such a reaction to be a cultural and faith-integrated process across multiple scales, ranging from village and community to regional, in scope. One critical aspect of extreme weather and climate change response in the Pacific is migration. However, the impacts of migration include organizing, adaptation and urban poverty, a further source of vulnerability. Consequently, human mobility in response to extreme weather and climate change is far more complex than originally addressed and is deserving of deeper consideration. © 2017 WIT Press,",0.18254572493691526,0.5060817248911494,0.16106657058731122,0.34787261534370456,0.2754109333041951,0.13166439764001509,0.27592142881313675

Conservation of biodiversity in the pacific islands of oceania: Challenges and opportunities,"Pacific Island biodiversity has a notorious record of decline and extinction which continues due to habitat loss and degradation, invasive species, overexploitation, pollution, disease and human-forced climate change. In terrestrial systems, these global and local pressures are more acute because of relatively small land to sea area, high endemism and poor adaptations to resist predation. Regional policy and learning frameworks exist to combat biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, but implementation remains patchy across the 22 Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) within Oceania. PICTs are challenged by small, under-resourced government departments, limited data, and strong political will for rapid economic development at the cost of ecological sustainability. In this synthesis of the special issue, we identify the challenges and opportunities for biodiversity conservation on Pacific islands. We identified bright spots of implementation occurring through regional initiatives, knowledge-sharing networks, and community-based management. The challenge looms large, given the relatively small-scale efforts compared to the core drive for development of natural resources which continues to pervade island communities. Five key initiatives promise improved conservation effectiveness: 1) alignment of national biodiversity strategies to the Aichi Targets, under the Convention on Biological Diversity; 2) increased engagement with local communities to promote wise stewardship and local environmental monitoring; 3) dissemination of best practice guidelines for management through learning networks; 4) cost-benefit analyses that drive investment in biosecurity and invasive control; and 5) implementation of integrated island management that accounts for the multiple synergistic benefits of ecosystem management (e.g., climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction, improved health).",0.23307766405383265,0.39625350489289896,0.20099593630636362,0.3565768009374753,0.19205533004018302,0.11332258052522937,0.15599039171647677
Managing drought-sensitive forests under global change. Low competition enhances long-term growth and water uptake in Abies pinsapo,"Understanding forest responses to the current climate change requires to investigate the effects of competition, buffering or enhancing process of forests decline. Here we attempt to place intra-specific competition in a climate change context, using as experimental system the drought-sensitive fir Abies pinsapo. We conducted a decade-long (2004-2015) investigation at four permanent plots (two thinned plots and two controls), where all trees were identified, tagged and mapped. Experimental thinning was performed attempting to enhance stand structure diversity by (1) reducing tree competition, (2) increasing the equitability of size classes (i.e. diversity) and (3) randomizing tree spatial pattern. We focus on tree basal area increment and sap flow density, as regards microclimate and competition, to quantify the extent to that thinning alleviates drought in the remaining trees. The results support that lower competition fosters short- to long-term tree-level physiological responses, specifically, improved growth and water uptake in the remaining trees. Density reduction provides a promising strategy for minimizing climate change effects on drought-sensitive tree species by improving resources availability to the remaining trees. Nevertheless, our results also support a higher air temperature and soil water depletion according to density reduction, suggesting that lower competition might also increase soil and understory evapotranspiration. Adaptive management, as the experimental thinning reported here, may increase tree-level resources availability, but the long-term stand-level effectiveness of this approach at sustaining forest ecosystem functioning remains uncertain.",0.7111200544836458,0.23420591371966373,0.19860546277613142,0.2972654251564581,0.04488434320572649,0.04652290599152235,0.19130474748266055
"Legitimate adaptive flood risk governance beyond the dikes: the cases of Hamburg, Helsinki and Rotterdam","It has recently been recommended that a shift from traditional flood prevention to more adaptive strategies is made, focusing on the reduction in and recovery from flood impacts as a means to improve resilience to climate impacts. This shift has had implications for the public-private divide in adaptive flood risk governance. In an urban context, it means that private actors such as developers and residents come into play, necessitating governance arrangements which cross the public-private divide. The division of responsibilities for water safety between the public and private sectors affects the way legitimacy is gained for these arrangements and raises new legitimacy issues. The paper offers an analysis of public and private responsibilities in adaptive flood risk governance arrangements, as well as of the legitimacy of the arrangements in the light of the public-private divide. A comparative case study is presented for three urban regeneration projects in un-embanked areas in Hamburg, Germany, Helsinki, Finland, and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, where adaptive strategies have been applied. The results show that network arrangements with joint public-private responsibilities use direct forms of participation and deliberation, but that these do not necessarily lead to more legitimate arrangements in the eyes of stakeholders as is often suggested in the literature. Both network and more public hierarchical arrangements can be perceived as quite legitimate under certain conditions.",0.10778132232924854,0.4183369100251656,0.1644799193377006,0.19085574054752968,0.15399961816413577,0.6703326481851896,0.42494004670023056
Resilience of the poorest: coping strategies and indigenous knowledge of living with the floods in Northern Namibia,"In Northern Namibia, the climate is highly polarised between dry and wet seasons, and local communities have lived with these varying weather extremes for centuries. However, the recent changes in socio-environmental dynamics-associated with urbanisation, inappropriate spatial planning, and population growth-have disturbed the river system in the area. These changes, together with torrential seasonal rains, have aggravated the social impacts of the flood events. By using various qualitative and quantitative data sources, and comparative analyses between the flood dynamics in urban and rural environments, this research studies local residents' coping strategies to endure the irregular flood events from the perspective of socio-ecological resilience. Particular interest is placed on the learning processes that enhance the residents' capability to cope and the role of indigenous knowledge. Indigenous knowledge (IK) has been emphasised as a source of resilience in both theory and practice, as it is built upon learning from past experiences of natural hazards. The findings reveal that the floods are a result of complex and relational development without the necessary linear relationship between the causes and effects. The abrupt socio-ecological changes, together with the multiple stressors related to poverty, have made residents more vulnerable to the flood events and attenuated the communities' coping strategies based on IK. Instead of focusing on the communities' capacity to self-organise, the focus of resilience building needs to be directed to emphasising the broader socio-political processes, which are making the communities vulnerable in the first place.",0.1605212091188658,0.4319292927018215,0.15924627760263538,0.39544698347158114,0.11305672233252116,0.16567003850636705,0.638879953438669
FARMERS' ADAPTATION TO GROUNDWATER SHORTAGE IN THE DRY AREAS: IMPROVING APPROPRIATION OR ENHANCING ACCOMMODATION?,"The objective of this paper is to identify farmers' strategies to adapt to groundwater shortage in vulnerable arid areas of south Tunisia. In the selected area, the potential of rainfed agriculture is very limited and groundwater is the only source of irrigation. With intensive overuse of groundwater signs of groundwater table depletion are starting to appear and farmers are becoming more concerned about water shortage. Based on a survey among farmers, we proceeded with a 'principal component factors' analysis followed by a 'hierarchical clustering' using Ward's method, in order to investigate different farmers' adaptation behaviour when faced with groundwater shortage. A set of relevant variables were used for this purpose. The cluster analysis generates three groups of farmers based on their irrigation practices, types of irrigation investment, and other related structural variables. A first group is formed by large farmerswho combine both expansive strategies, by investing in enhancing groundwater appropriation, and accommodating strategies, by enhancing on-farm management of the available resource. The second type of farmers are small and mainly focus on expansive strategies, while the third group is also composed of small farmers demonstrating purely contractive strategies, referring to reduced scale of farm operation.

Irrigation as an adaptive strategy to climate change: an economic perspective on Brazilian agriculture,This paper analyzes the potential effects of climate change on Brazilian agriculture by considering irrigation as an adaptive strategy. Investigations were performed to determine how climatic variability influences irrigation and whether this adaptive measure actually reduces producers' vulnerability to climate change. We used a simultaneous equations model with endogenous switching to account for the heterogeneity in the decision of whether to use adaptive measures. We compared the expected land values under the actual and counterfactual cases of farm households that either adapt or do not adapt to climate change. Simulation results show that irrigation can be an effective tool for counteracting the harmful effects of climate change. The income of farmers tends to increase on lands where irrigation technologies are practiced. These conclusions confirm the need to invest in adaptation strategies to prepare Brazil for coping with the adverse effects of global climate change.,0.8425729443329938,0.2561623046604836,0.12122428952179606,0.3815524308086333,0.03363661910769739,0.030791771308179734,0.08035845807973241
Adaptive Capacity of Water Governance: Cases From the Alps and the Andes,"The Alps and the Andes are both considered water towers in their respective continents and are thus significant not only for their own water needs but also for those of lowland regions farther downstream. As climate change impacts on the hydrology of mountain regions are increasingly observed, attention is turning to the adaptive capacity of the water governance regimes in mountain communities. This paper explores the adaptive capacity of two contrasting water governance regimes in the Swiss Alps and the Chilean Andes. It assesses adaptive capacity by analyzing a set of governance-related adaptive capacity indicators in the context of recent extreme events, which serve as proxies for future climate change. Across these highly contrasted governance contexts, analysis reveals both similar and distinct institutional challenges for developing and mobilizing adaptive capacity in relation to climatic uncertainty and change. It also identifies emergent tensions related to temporal and spatial scales. Conclusions point to the need to focus on challenges relating to trust, integration of hydroclimatic information, and flexibility and iterativity of rules and plans across governance scales to better manage the exacerbating impacts of both climate variability and climate change.",0.39639530796437156,0.33953860787946394,0.14679836357933138,0.33512695973734663,0.10952264946728581,0.19316620925725506,0.5642012969127461
Using practical and social information to influence flood adaptation behavior,"As the prospect for more frequent and severe extreme weather events gains scientific support, many nations are evaluating mitigation and adaptation options. Insurance and home retrofits could reduce household welfare losses due to flood events. Yet even after disasters, households often fail to take risk mitigation actions. This paper presents the first randomized field experiment that tests the effect of information provision on household uptake of flood insurance and home retrofits. A sample of 364 flood-prone households in Bangkok was randomly split into treatment and control groups. The treatment group received practical details on home retrofits and flood insurance as well as social information regarding the insurance purchase decisions of peers. Results indicate that the information intervention increased insurance purchases by about five percentage points, while no effect was detected for home retrofits. This effect is nearly equal to the increase in uptake that the national insurance program in Thailand has achieved through all other means since its establishment in 2012. If scaled up to include all uninsured, flood-prone households in Bangkok, nearly 70,000 additional households could be insured. The results suggest that well-designed information interventions could increase uptake of flood insurance, without additional premium subsidies or mandates.",0.22662158075333294,0.36028532912773303,0.06223264930388669,0.31714797955174,0.12470006684604516,0.3533755064158254,0.44742320021367127
"One Risk Replaces Another Floods, Evictions and Policies on Jakarta's Riverbanks","It has long been recognised that poor, marginalised groups are the most vulnerable to hazards related to climate change. Several recent studies have suggested that such communities may be doubly vulnerable when interventions are carried out to make climate-change-related adaptations. Climate-change interventions may be ""maladaptive"" and may further ""injure"" vulnerable communities. Although such findings are troubling, little empirical research has been conducted to explore how and where climate change interventions and discourses are shaping and being shaped by social stratification, inclusion and exclusion. This article therefore aims to contribute to our understanding of the negative (side-)effects of climate change interventions for vulnerable social groups. We investigate this issue in the context of climate change and increased flood risk in Jakarta, Indonesia. Our analysis of two cases of intervention shows how these are ""maladaptations"". Flood policies in Jakarta are clearly failing to mitigate risk for the city's poorest populations and are instead compounding the risks they face with those of eviction and increased poverty. The data on which this paper is based were collected during a total of one-and-a-half years of anthropological fieldwork conducted by the authors between 2010 and 2015.",0.2947031538586007,0.4256953523209721,0.09544087793817181,0.3588822186858706,0.0941868450549014,0.24375829594765128,0.21058302395715742
Women and water management in times of climate change: participatory and inclusive processes,"This paper focuses on community engagement, and particularly the inclusion of women, in water management as a response to climate change. Addressing water-related problems is central to climate change adaptation, and civil society, marginalized populations and women, in particular, must be involved. This is for both moral and pragmatic reasons: not only are the marginalized the first and worst affected by extreme weather events, but they also possess local ecological, social and political knowledge which can inform and contribute significantly to climate change adaptation strategies. Because of their social roles and position worldwide, women are greatly affected by water scarcity and flooding, and tend to be gravely impacted by poor water management, yet they face great difficulties in participating effectively in governance bodies. Sustainable long-term management of water resources in the face of climate change requires the participation of women, who possess knowledge of effective social technologies for coping with and adapting to climate change. Community-based environmental education is therefore required in order to expand the equitable involvement of women in water-related climate change adaptation activities and policy development. Environmental non-governmental organizations worldwide, working on shoestring budgets at the local level, are developing a range of methods to organize, raise consciousness and confidence, and help local activists create successful climate defense programs. This paper discusses South North initiatives and models for community-based environmental and climate change education which are using the democratic opening provided by watershed-based governance structures to broaden grassroots participation, especially of women, in political processes. We outline the activities and results of two international projects: the Sister Watersheds project, with Brazilian and Canadian partners (2002-2008); and a Climate Change Adaptation in Africa project with partners in Canada, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa (2010-2012).

Does External Funding Help Adaptation? Evidence from Community-Based Water Management in the Colombian Andes,"Despite debate regarding whether, and in what form, communities need external support for adaptation to environmental change, few studies have examined how external funding impacts adaptation decisions in rural resource-dependent communities. In this article, we use quantitative and qualitative methods to assess how different funding sources influence the initiative to adapt to water scarcity in the Colombian Andes. We compare efforts to adapt to water scarcity in 111 rural Andean communities with varied dependence on external funding for water management activities. Findings suggest that despite efforts to use their own internal resources, communities often need external support to finance adaptation strategies. However, not all external financial support positively impacts a community's abilities to adapt. Results show the importance of community-driven requests for external support. In cases where external support was unsolicited, the results show a decline, or ""crowding-out,"" in community efforts to adapt. In contrast, in cases where communities initiated the request for external support to fund their own projects, findings show that external intervention is more likely to enhance or ""crowds-in"" community-driven adaptation.",0.49360584046555855,0.3829424137536576,0.13283839693781913,0.361883709758141,0.10642313522366595,0.09801113849541238,0.28961963757465725
"Floods and mangrove forests, friends or foes? Perceptions of relationships and risks in Cameroon coastal mangroves","Faced with the growing influence of climate change on climate driven perturbations such as flooding and biodiversity loss, managing the relationship between mangroves and their environment has become imperative for their protection. Hampering this is the fact that the full scope of the threats faced by specific mangrove forests is not yet well documented. Amongst some uncertainties is the nature of the relationship/interaction of mangroves with climate driven perturbations prevalent in their habitat such as coastal floods. We investigated the relationship between coastal flooding and mangrove forest stabilization, identify perceptions of flood risk and responses to offset identified effects. Random household surveys were carried out within four communities purposively sampled within the Cap Cameroon. Coastal changes were investigated over a period of 43 years (1965-2008). Seasonal flooding improved access to mangrove forests and hence promoted their exploitation for non-timber forest products (NTFPs) such as fuel wood and mangrove poles. 989 ha of mangrove forests were estimated to be lost over a period of 43 years in Cap Cameroon with implications on forest resources base, ecosystem stability, and livelihoods. Alternative livelihood activities were found to be carried out to moderate interruptions in fishing, with associated implications for mangrove forest dynamics. Respondents were of the opinion that risks associated with floods and mangrove deforestation will pose a major challenge for sustainable management of mangroves. These locally relevant perceptions and responses should however enable the identification of pertinent needs, challenges and opportunities to inform and orient effective decision-making, and to facilitate the development and participation in adaptive management strategies.

Farming the Floodplain: Ecological and Agricultural Tradeoffs and Opportunities in River and Stream Governance in New England's Changing Climate,"In New England (United States) climate change models forecast increasingly intense, frequent floods. Communities in this region are already experiencing these changes, along with the negative consequences associated with them, such as inundation, erosion, natural habitat destruction, and property damage. As it is in many places around the world, agriculture in New England is often in floodplains, which means that farmers are at greater risk due to where they farm. These farmers are already adapting to the increased risk of flooding; however, some of their actions may affect communities downstream, both human and ecological. This case study examines the competing perspectives of farmers and other community stakeholders in New England as farmers work to adapt to increasing flood impacts. Our premise is that, considering the intensified pressures of climate change on agriculture near rivers and streams, we must find ways to allow farmers to adapt to protect their farms and downstream communities.",0.7552754819330749,0.2518629538380436,0.09798109835175071,0.3348703833500642,0.045564661359525485,0.06273420741899077,0.08552358929547763
Optimising drought adaptation by small-scale farmers in southern Africa through integration of indigenous and technologically-driven practices,"This paper reviews and synthesises research-based literature on drought adaptation practices among small-scale farmers in southern Africa. The paper reviews the existing literature in order to identify ways in which small-scale poor farmers in southern Africa adapt to the effects of drought. The paper further presents some constraints that limit small-scale farmers from adopting technologically-driven drought adaptation practices. The main message of this paper is that neither indigenous nor technologically-driven practices should be seen as panacea on their own, but integrating the two sets of practices could optimise adaptation by small-scale farmers. The material presented in this paper could be helpful to researchers, development planners and policy makers in their quest towards finding means of enhancing drought adaptation practices by small-scale farmers. © 2014 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.",0.9121010595354943,0.234135550169735,0.06456158496990841,0.5,0.04866809741501568,0.037457892341466806,0.06583878387459345
Attitudes of Farmers and Rural Area Residents Toward Climate Change Adaptation Measures: Their Preferences and Determinants of Their Attitudes,"In this study, data obtained from an online survey were analyzed to identify the perception gap between farmers and nonfarmers (rural area residents) toward climate change adaptation measures with conventional and new elements of the psychological mechanism. Key findings from the study were as follows. First, the perception of climate change risk and awareness of impacts of climate change had strong effects on the preferences for and willingness to participate in measures rather than trusting the government and values pertaining to the policy decision-making process. Second, farmers tended to prefer protection and transfer of risks (insurance) as climate change adaptation measures more than nonfarmers did. Farmers also tended to be unwilling to participate in withdrawal, reflecting the difficulty of relocating agricultural land. Third, farmers' willingness to participate in climate change adaptation measures was determined strongly by their preferences. Therefore, to increase preference, there needs to be communication about multiple risks including climate change risks associated with not only adjustment and protection, which tend to be preferred, but also withdrawal, which tends to not be preferred. Contrasting with these, nonfarmers tended to prefer any particular climate change adaptation measures statistically-significantly, but they tended to be willing to accept self-help absolutely and withdrawal relatively. Also, farmers' willingness to participate in climate change adaptation measures was determined strongly by their preference. One of the ways to increase the preference is communicating about the multiple risks including climate change risks associated with adjustment, protection and transfer which tend to be preferred more than nonfarmers did. Finally, trust in the government and values pertaining to the policy decision-making process did not necessarily have a serious impact on policy preferences and willingness to participate, both for farmers and nonfarmers. More analyses for other sectors will be needed for further study.",0.7601505103060777,0.24362327811620443,0.08177492982255127,0.2742186101835855,0.04643298026093109,0.09910520221376519,0.06632552199158696

Climate risks and forest practices: forest owners' acceptance of advice concerning climate change,"Based on qualitative interviews with Swedish forest owners this study focuses on climate change, risk management and forest governance from the perspective of the forest owners. The Swedish forest governance system has undergone extensive deregulation, with the result that social norms and knowledge dissemination are seen by the state as important means of influencing forest owners' understandings and practices. Drawing on Foucault's concept of governmentality this study contributes knowledge on how forest owners understand and manage climate-related risk and their acceptance of advice. From the interview study, three main conclusions can be drawn: (1) forest owners' considerations largely concern ordinary forestry activities; (2) knowledge about forest management and climate adaptation combines experiences and ideas from various sources; and (3) risk awareness and knowledge of ""best practices"" are not enough to ensure change in forestry practices. The results of this study show that the forest owners have to be selective and negotiate about what knowledge to consider relevant and meaningful for their own forest practice. Accordingly, local forest management can be understood as situated in a web of multifarious interests, claims, concerns and knowledges, where climate change adaptation is but one of several aspects that forest owners have to consider.",0.6838138485071966,0.2793305338316155,0.23719691126639858,0.20408193111211956,0.037043589502247475,0.03307871819310719,0.10656909020317297
"Climate variabilities and evolution of soil occupation in the Timia oasis in the Agadez Region, Niger","For decades, the arid and semi-Arid regions on Niger have experienced recurrent droughts that have led to crises in the morphogenetic processes. Climate degradation has resulted in reducing vegetation, resulting in the increase of water and wind erosion processes. This has also led to changes in land use. An analysis of diachronic satellite images helps understand the evolution of soil occupation and the changes in the state of its surface. This paper uses satellite images to investigate the evolution of land use in the oasis of Timia (Province of Iférouane in the Agadez Region, Niger). Since changes in soil transfers have had important consequences on the exploitation of natural resources, we also investigated the adaptation strategies developed by local populations. The methodology consisted in analyzing climate-related data to explore climate variability, examining satellite images of 1976, 1988 and 2010 to evaluate the transformations in land use, and carrying out socio-economic surveys to identify adaptation strategies adopted by local populations. © Geo-Eco-Trop 2017.

Promoting Resilient Livelihoods through Adaptive Social Protection: Lessons from 124 programmes in South Asia,"Adaptive Social Protection refers to efforts to integrate social protection (SP), disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA), the need for which is increasingly recognised by practitioners and academics. Relying on 124 agricultural programmes implemented in five countries in Asia, this article considers how these elements are being brought together, and explores the potential gains of these linkages. It shows that full integration is still relatively limited but that, when it occurs, it helps to shift the time horizon beyond short-term interventions aimed at supporting peoples' coping strategies and/or graduation objectives, towards longer-term interventions that can help promote transformation towards climate and disaster resilient livelihood options.",0.3910099595756042,0.42064942281950307,0.19057363324698934,0.45687405543228377,0.08687413047044436,0.18552393149694818,0.2688858499458992
Agricultural adaptation to drought in the Sri Lankan dry zone,"Droughts affect more people than any other natural disaster. Drought severity is not merely a function of precipitation; it emerges from a web of interrelations between human and natural systems. The impacts of drought are equally complex, shifting across temporal scales, economic sectors, and regions. Even in regions with similar hydroclimatic characteristics, there is tremendous variation in the effects of drought. This study combines satellite imagery, geospatial data, and qualitative data to identify the multi -scalar factors that drive variations in agricultural responses to drought. We analyzed eleven years of remotely sensed imagery to identify agricultural areas in which cultivation occurred during an extreme drought in Sri Lanka. We visited a subset of these communities and conducted interviews with officials and farmers to identify the factors that influenced agricultural adaptation. Results suggest that though structural factors such as infrastructural capacity and physical environment significantly affect agricultural adaptation, dynamic factors such as local control of water supply, perceived risk, community cohesion, and farmer experience explain significant variation in the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems.

"Agricultural policy informed by farmers' adaptation experience to climate change in Veneto, Italy","There is an increasing call for agricultural water management to adapt to climate change, yet efforts in this direction often consider only the policy dimension, or planned adaptation perspective. However, it is crucial to include an assessment of farmers' autonomous adaptation into the design and evaluation of rural policy measures. Amongst others, this helps avoid doubling efforts and ensure the effectiveness of the policies proposed. Moreover, farmers are the primary receivers of climate-proofing agricultural policies. Hence, to maximise a policy's success, it is fundamental to include farmers in its design phases. Farmers autonomously react to changes and policies should build on ongoing efforts. This work, carried out in the Veneto Region of Italy, proved the advantages of approaching adaptation as a continuum between autonomous and planned, rather than addressing the two separately. We first collected farmers' perceptions of and adaptations to change through an online questionnaire. We then identified the major determinants of their choice to adapt through a multinomial probit model. We analysed farmers' expectations of effectiveness of five different adaptation options for water conservation, via an ad-hoc online decision support system tool, mDSSweb. Our work provided policy makers with information on how different typologies of farmers are (not) adapting their practices to climate change. We clearly identified which groups of farmers the policies should target first and with what type of support. Both policy makers and farmers reacted positively to our approach and expressed interest in up-scaling it to become more inclusive.",0.8824992002479348,0.2192803720725188,0.08794564004841574,0.38135192839532855,0.02440704182491619,0.05910623087059337,0.0875113673834978
Ethnoveterinary of Sahrawi pastoralists of Western Sahara: camel diseases and remedies,"Background: Pastoral populations around the world hold complex and detailed ethnoveterinary knowledge, essential for the survival of their herds and securing their livelihood. In recent decades, several studies have given attention to local veterinary remedies and practices and their validation, and to the local conceptualization of livestock diseases. Despite this, relatively little has been reported on indigenous knowledge of camel diseases (e.g., aetiological factors, epidemiological patterns, symptoms, prevention and treatments). This paper focuses on the traditional knowledge of camel diseases and their treatments among Sahrawi nomads, detailing how this knowledge is powerfully reflected on pastoral adaptation strategies to the ecological system of Western Sahara. Methods: Between 2005 and 2010, freelisting exercise on camel diseases with 46 Sahrawi nomads and refugees, semi-structured interviews with 36 knowledgeable informants about camel diseases and associated treatments, and a voucher specimen collection of the plants and products cited were conducted in the territories administered by the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, Western Sahara. Analytical methods included standard ethnobiological, ethnobotanical and cultural consensus analyses. Results: In total, 42 camel diseases were freelisted by informants, with four (i.e., mange, dermatomycosis, respiratory infections, and mastitis) found to be culturally highly salient. These four represent the most common veterinary conditions experienced by Sahrawi pastoralists. In addition, 42 plant species belonging to 22 botanical families (Hammada scoparia, Acacia tortilis, Zygophyllum gaetulum, Nucularia perrinii, and Panicum turgidum among the species most used) were listed as used in the treatment of these diseases, as well as about 30 remedies of animal (e.g., from camels, donkeys, and/or spiny-tailed lizards) and mineral origin, and of cauterizations. Conclusions: This study provides an overall picture of the most important camel diseases and remedies as reported by Sahrawi informants, detailing how the vast knowledge that the Sahrawi hold on the health and disease of their camels is constructed through contrasts between their customary nomadic land (and associated climate, soils, grazing and therapeutic resources) and the surrounding areas (and associated diseases), which are traditionally used only in cases of drought.",0.7086885409537406,0.38237096767236256,0.14151950993258905,0.3895125360060714,0.07045835117730273,0.03473377692166398,0.07839984128683185
Strategies used by the saffron producers of Taliouine (Morocco) to adapt to climate change,"In Morocco, the mountainous regions extend over about 26% of the national territory where 30% of the total population live. They contain opportunities for agriculture, forestry, pastureland and mining. The production systems in these zones are characterised by crop diversification. However, these areas have become vulnerable to the effects of climate change. To understand these effects in relation to the population living in these areas, a study was carried out in the zone of Taliouine, in the Anti-Atlas. The vulnerability of crop productions to climate change was analysed and the different ways of adaptation adopted by farmers were identified. The work was done on saffron, the most profitable crop in the target area even though it requires much water. Our results show that the majority of the farmers surveyed had noticed variations in the climate of the region: irregularity of precipitation leading to a decrease in quantity and an uneven distribution throughout the year; rise in temperature; reduction in the cold period and less snow. These variations had impacts on the cropping system of saffron and its productivity. To cope with these effects, the farmers adopted various strategies: better management and use of water; diversification of agricultural activities; increase in the contribution of non-agricultural activities to their gross income; and seasonal migration.",0.9462639682067315,0.18567855777616005,0.09612965945727012,0.4656687097556021,0.032295817856765455,0.021141076113101984,0.0411671851559969
How Can African Agriculture Adapt to Climate Change? A Counterfactual Analysis from Ethiopia,"We analyze the impact of different adaptation strategies on crop net revenues in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia. We estimate a multinomial endogenous switching regression model of climate change adaptation and crop net revenues and implement a counterfactual analysis. Households data are combined with spatial climate data. We find that adaptation to climate change based upon a portfolio of strategies significantly increases farm net revenues. Changing crop varieties has a positive and significant impact on net revenues when coupled with water conservation strategies or soil conservation strategies, but not when implemented in isolation.",0.7854716476118793,0.2426189101218958,0.11740087136860883,0.45959636669030524,0.05161044569509167,0.04028357232408256,0.0563266752615792
"How do small-scale fishers adapt to environmental variability? Lessons from Baja California, Sur, Mexico","Many fisheries stocks and the livelihoods of those who make their living from fishing are in decline, and these declines are exacerbated by uncertainties associated with increased climate variability and change. Social scientists have long documented the importance of mobility and diversification in reducing the risk and uncertainty associated with climate variability, particularly in the context of small-scale fishing. However, it is unclear how these traditional mechanisms are buffering fishers against the varied stressors they currently face, including those associated with environmental variability. This paper examines how fishers on the southern gulf coast of the Mexican state of Baja California Sur perceive and respond to stressors associated with normal environmental variability, how their ability to adapt is spatially distributed, and what threats they perceive to their continued ability to adapt. Understanding the adaptation strategies and everyday vulnerabilities that fishers face can elucidate problems associated with current fisheries management and the underlying factors that cause vulnerability, and also help decision makers, including fishers themselves, develop more effective adaptation strategies in the face of climate change. © 2014, Sievanen; licensee Springer.",0.7666311021640981,0.3727160622838458,0.11446284224165146,0.5295246842993417,0.2835815901018806,0.04184309011294764,0.06249297970802748
Do climate factors matter for producers’ irrigation practices decisions?,"The study examines whether climatic factors play a role in producers’ irrigation decisions. Empirical analysis uses a set of repeated cross-sectional farm level data collected in three American states: Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Empirical findings provide evidence that climatic conditions are factored into irrigation decisions. For example, higher mean temperature reduces the likelihood of using sprinkler irrigation in the study area. More importantly, findings of this study point to the importance of studying both long-term and short-term climate patterns. Long-term climate patterns weigh more in producers’ decisions regarding the use of sprinklers. Both long-term and short-term climate patterns seem to affect producers’ decisions on the use of WMPs. Producers may respond differently to similar changes in long-term and short-term climate patterns. For example, a higher occurrence of drought in the previous year predicts a higher rate of sprinklers, while an increasing trend of drought occurrence during the previous 30 years predicts the opposite. Our findings also highlight the importance of considering various aspects of the climate patterns. Average climate conditions, such as mean temperature and annual precipitation, and the occurrences of extreme weather events, such as droughts and intensive precipitation, have stronger predictive powers of producers’ irrigation decisions than the coefficients of variation. In the study area, the occurrence of intensive precipitation seems to have the strongest impact on producers’ irrigation decisions. © 2017",0.7568257513895016,0.251083201134869,0.08827938099396719,0.29542949757281023,0.052127403273792346,0.030682339597378122,0.19738525583146374
Adaptation of Periurban Cattle Production Systems to Environmental Changes: Feeding Strategies of Herdsmen in Southern Benin,"We undertook a survey of 112 cattle farms in the periphery of Cotonou in Benin, with the aim to characterize the diversity of the production systems and to better understand herders' feeding strategies and perspectives. We used the categorical component analysis and two-step clustering techniques to classify the farms into homogeneous groups. The adaptive strategy of a given farm was predicted through logistic regression analysis technique. Four distinct farm types were identified as follows: large integrated agro-silvopastoral (17%), small agro-silvopastoral (28%), pastoral (30%), and silvopastoral (25%). Irrespective of farm type, low availability, and difficult access to pasture due to increased crop/vegetable farming, climate variability and urbanization were commonly reported by all herders. Current coping strategies included the use of lowlands pastoral resources and exploring new grazing routes. Future strategies included moving animals towards rural locations and significantly (p < 0.001) depended on farm type and its proximity to urban centers.",0.9422914423605422,0.22743117007399088,0.10599041851098952,0.583031923556592,0.017220698253969716,0.019714749438986254,0.02320097232060071
Farm service agency employee intentions to use weather and climate data in professional services,"Agricultural service providers often work closely with producers, and are well positioned to include weather and climate change information in the services they provide. By doing so, they can help producers reduce risks due to climate variability and change. A national survey of United States Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency (FSA) field staff (n = 4621) was conducted in 2016. The survey was designed to assess FSA employees' use of climate and weather-related data and explore their perspectives on climate change, attitudes toward adaptation and concerns regarding climate- and weather-driven risks. Two structural equation models were developed to explore relationships between these factors, and to predict respondents' willingness to integrate climate and weather data into their professional services in the future. The two models were compared with assess the relative influence of respondents' current use of weather and climate information. Findings suggest that respondents' perceptions of weather-related risk in combination with their personal observations of weather variability help predict whether an individual intends to use weather and climate information in the future. Importantly, climate change belief is not a significant predictor of this intention; however, the belief that producers will have to adapt to climate change in order to remain viable is. Surprisingly, whether or not an individual currently uses weather and climate information is not a good predictor of whether they intend to in the future. This suggests that there are opportunities to increase employee exposure and proficiency with weather and climate information to meet the needs of American farmers by helping them to reduce risk.",0.7730833476843862,0.27809021507784176,0.13207147059380278,0.2565270788598468,0.041608160623181456,0.03595659103361133,0.058861593618198774
Agricultural adaptation to flood in lowland rice production areas of Central Vietnam: understanding the 'regenerated rice' ratoon system,"Vietnam is reported to be one of the most vulnerable countries to future climate change, particularly in relation to sea-level rise and extreme climatic events. Agricultural adaptation and mitigation will be crucial for maintaining food and fibre production. Areas in Central Vietnam are prone to flooding, particularly in the lowland rice production areas. This article presents a case study of how small-scale rice farmers in the lowland areas of Le Thuy district, Quang Binh province, have transitioned into a ratoon system, locally referred to as 're-generated rice', as a means of adapting to early flooding. While ratoon rice systems have been globally implemented, farmers in Le Thuy have adopted this system recently, based on their indigenous knowledge. The ratoon system was found to result in economic, social and environmental benefits for the surveyed households (N = 80), despite typically lower yields than the conventional system (approximately 70% of conventional). Through the sustainable livelihoods framework, findings show that the ratoon system is more economically efficient than the conventional and also allows farming households to spend more time on other income-generating, social or family activities, which is particularly important for balancing the gender division of labour. However, the new system tests the ability of the region to meet provincial level rice production targets, challenging conceptualizations of food security and livelihood security.",0.9065918558145052,0.2527077949038176,0.06419165392563375,0.4318174928151464,0.08947367513420046,0.0444813587628847,0.06814260702273026
"Farmers' adoption of water-saving irrigation technology alleviates water scarcity in metropolis suburbs: A case study of Beijing, China","Water scarcity has threatened the food security and been a critical concern in China. Promoting modern agricultural irrigation technologies has been identified as an important measure against water scarcity. The overall goal of this study was to analyze the adoption of water-saving irrigation technology by farmers and to identify the major influencing factors of this decision for metropolis suburbs. Based on a field survey of Beijing of China, the results showed that 53.1% of farmers adopted water-saving irrigation technologies to cope with water scarcity, most of which adopted engineering water-saving technologies. The number of adopted water-saving irrigation technologies followed a strong negative correlation with the share of adopters. Econometric analysis revealed that education, farm size, on-farm demonstration, cooperative, training, groundwater, access to information, water use associations, drought-prone area, neighboring farmers, and policy subsidies significantly improved the adaption to water scarcity. Age, production specialization, and cost posed a negative effect on famers' adoption of water-saving irrigation technologies. These results and implications provide an understanding of farmers' sustainable irrigation practices and offer an insight to influencing factors to frame improved strategies and policies that enable to cope with water scarcity of metropolis suburbs.",0.974625933149996,0.1319343715944375,0.10459292341758927,0.38147566016193435,0.005703066768745449,0.025250116621714818,0.9156624632605611
Modeling (Im) mobility: The decision to stay in disaster prone area amongs fishermen community in Semarang,"The existing literature on population immobility, especially immobility associated with climate change-related disaster, is very finite. Consequently, the understanding of population immobility in disaster-prone areas is still low. This article adds to the literature on population immobility by modeling decision to stay in the disaster-prone area amongst fishermen community in Tambak Lorok, Semarang. The survey was conducted among the residents of Kampung Tambak Lorok Semarang, which is prone to 3 disasters simultaneously i.e. sea level rise, land subsidence, and tidal inundation. The study sample was 235 heads of households selected using proportional sampling area technique. This study constructs three factors: place valuation, disaster adaptation, and stakeholder intervention. These three factors used as explanatory variables for modeling the decision to stay. The study employed a Confirmatory Factor Analysis using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyses the data and examines the logical relationship between those three factors in staying decision. Our results suggest that the place valuation and disaster adaptation significantly influence the decision to stay, while stakeholder interventions are influential but not significant. We concur that residents with positive place valuation and good disaster adaptation tend to stay although threatening by disaster. More broadly, this study contributes to our understanding of population immobility in the disaster-prone area by modeling the decision to stay. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",0.2788840738419079,0.3975547094610074,0.12579331173921574,0.30556103469598334,0.09070997181510289,0.14648111520053786,0.15784657084919915

"Farmers' perceptions of and adaptations to drought in Herat Province, Afghanistan","Drought is a significant natural hazard in Herat Province, Afghanistan. The objective of this study was to explore farmers' perceptions of the drought's prevalence and characteristics, its socioeconomic and environmental impacts, their strategies for coping with and mitigating it, and types of conflicts and resolution mechanisms. A questionnaire was completed by 147 farming households. The results indicate that farmers' perceptions regarding drought are in line with the results obtained using the precipitation data. Even though the respondents have religious belief in interpreting the weather related issues, they also perceived drought as the climatic and environmental factors such as increased temperature, decreased precipitation, and other factors like war, financial weakness, deforestation, over-exploitation of groundwater, lack of electricity supply etc. The results show that drought has had serious economic impacts, including loss of employment and reduction in crop yield and livestock production, which have reduced farmers' livelihood options and weakened their financial situation. Social impacts have included migration, a sense of hopelessness and loss, conflicts over water, health problems, impacts on the schooling of children, malnutrition, and limits to food options. Significant environmental impacts such as an increase in temperature, pasture and forest degradation, deterioration of water quality, damage to fish and wildlife habitats, and groundwater depletion were also reported. Farmers used local techniques to adapt to drought and lessen its effects. Farmers perceived irrigation water to be a major source of conflict. Local elders, water-user associations, and formal courts were reported to be the most successful conflict resolution methods. It is expected that the results of this study will support policy makers within government and development agencies in Afghanistan to develop future drought adaptation policies.",0.9667256052552107,0.24539016676100273,0.0873478684536167,0.3984544881322651,0.012395429193782361,0.017152378771550583,0.1065429419983632
BUILDING FARM-LEVEL CAPACITIES IN IRRIGATION WATER MANAGEMENT TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE,"Climate change characterized by global warming has become a hotspot of research in recent years for water resources, agriculture, ecology and other disciplines. In India, studies have shown an increasing trend in surface temperature, with decreasing trends in rainfall. Farmers are also more affected by the climate variability which has a serious influence on their production and income. The climate change and adaptation (ClimaAdapt) programme was implemented from 2012 to 2016 to build farm-level capacities and enhance the adaptive capacity of the agricultural and water sectors in the Krishna basin of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states. Water-saving interventions such as direct seeded rice, a modified system of rice intensification and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) of rice were implemented in a cluster approach and enhanced water productivity. The training and implementation programmes increased the adaptation and awareness of farmers. Water measurements were carried out by using flumes and ultrasonic sensors. The area under direct seeded rice has increased to 64% in the study district and 77% of the trained farmers are adopting the practice. Capacity building, implementation and science-policy linkages are the key pillars of the programme to improve the adaptive capacity and scaling-up of water management practices.

Local beliefs and strategies of adaptation to climate change in Korhogo (Ivory Coast),"Over the last decades, the area of Korhogo, Ivory Coast, has experienced climatic variations that disturbed populations&#39; agricultural activities. This study was conducted from March 2009 to February 2012 in order to identify the causes perceptible by the populations of the climate variability and environmental change, and their endogenous strategies of adaptation. A qualitative approach based on semi-structured interviews, life stories and focus group discussions has been used for data collection. The historical and comprehensive method enabled to establish a relationship between populations&#39; perceptions and beliefs and their endogenous strategies of adaptation. The populations notice an extension of the dry season at the expenses of the rainy season, advanced deterioration of vegetation, of the drying up of the sources of water supply (rivers, backwaters and wells), and disappearance of some wild animals like elephant and hyena and of some plant species used by sculptors and traditional healers. The survey also shows that populations&#39; adaptation strategies are mainly based on local traditional beliefs and knowledge which are at the same time a barrier and an opportunity for the adaptation to climate variability. This article shows the importance of taking into account local knowledge in order to develop efficient adaptation strategies.",0.8253133927921877,0.2946363641069211,0.09714182493147701,0.5,0.08835854335027207,0.040889603509436906,0.1293846192579695
Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States: Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates,"2016 was one of the warmest and driest summers on record throughout much of the Northeastern United States (Northeast). Additionally, historically low winter snowfall preceding the summer of 2016 exacerbated drought conditions and led to record low streamflows in some regions. Climate models suggest that short-term summer droughts could increase in frequency and continue to pose challenges to farmers and water resource managers in the Northeast. Here we focus on the impacts of the drought on farmers in New York State (NY), an economically important agricultural state in the Northeast. We found that in several regions across NY 2015-16 winter snowfall, and 2016 growing season precipitation and streamflows were near or below the 10th percentile of the previous 60 years; and 2016 air temperatures were near or above the 90th percentile of the previous 60 years. Based on survey results, more than 70% of the 275 farmers surveyed across NY reported rainfed field crop and pasture yield losses greater than 30%, with some loses over 90%. In the hardest hit Western region of NY, substantial crop losses (> 30%) were reported for fruit and vegetable crops on farms with irrigation, due to limited irrigation equipment and water supplies (e.g. low streamflows, dry ponds or wells). After what they experienced in 2016, 32% of the 75 farmers in follow-up interviews invested in irrigation equipment and water sources in 2016, and 32% said they plan to do so in 2017. Thirty-two percent of farmers in follow-up interviews said they plan to take measures to improve soil health and soil organic matter to improve water holding capacity and better prepare for drought. Model estimates suggest NY state-wide crop irrigation water use could increase by 3-8 times in dry years compared to average growing seasons, increasing seasonal usage by millions of cubic meters. This highlights the potential for significant increases in water withdrawals in NY, with implications for water resources, particularly as the climate changes.",0.9311414289563065,0.2013034668158078,0.10433876399787201,0.2515545528392685,0.021459399877378344,0.037313222094179435,0.35453946828118166
Pathways to transformational change in the face of climate impacts: an analytical framework,"Unprecedented impacts of climate change and climate variability in the twenty-first century are likely to require transformational social, organizational and human responses. Yet, little existing empirical work examines how decision-makers can facilitate such responses. This paper suggests that in order to assess whether responses to climate risks and threats are transformational, it is necessary to move away from a focus only on outcomes and scale and towards the multiple dimensions of social responses and the processes through which transformational changes are realized. In so doing, the paper seeks to move the discussion on transformational change towards the processes and sustainability of adaptation interventions, and the changes they trigger. Drawing on the literature on transformational change in organizational theory and social-ecological systems, the paper first develops a framework with which to examine and assess development and adaptation interventions. The framework is then applied to eight interventions made between 2005 and 2011 in diverse socioecological settings across Africa. All interventions were underpinned by participatory action research methodologies. Our analysis shows how a focus on change agents, generalizability of field-scale adaptation mechanisms and pathways, and sustainability of outcomes, combined with attention to the scale and scope of change processes, provides information that can inform policy on the kinds of intervention that are likely to support long-term and sustainable responses to climate impacts. Although several of the cases mainly illustrate incremental adaptations, use of the analytical framework pointed towards the wider processes of systems change that might lead to transformative trajectories.",0.35917092915745347,0.39554195865550257,0.14441402349893478,0.38270373079632136,0.05632051765113837,0.09457922376633572,0.05839204653668588

Factors affecting farmers' adaptation strategies to environmental degradation and climate change effects: A farm level study in bangladesh,"Offering a case study of coastal Bangladesh, this study examines the adaptation of agriculturalists to degrading environmental conditions likely to be caused or exacerbated under global climate change. It examines four central components: (1) the rate of self-reported adoption of adaptive mechanisms (coping strategies) as a result of changes in climate; (2) ranking the potential coping strategies based on their perceived importance to agricultural enterprises; (3) identification the socio-economic factors associated with adoption of coping strategies, and (4) ranking potential constraints to adoption of coping strategies based on farmers' reporting on the degree to which they face these constraints. As a preliminary matter, this paper also reports on the perceptions of farmers in the study about their experiences with climatic change. The research area is comprised of three villages in the coastal region (Sathkhira district), a geographic region which climate change literature has highlighted as prone to accelerated degradation. One-hundred (100) farmers participated in the project's survey, from which the data was used to calculate weighted indexes for rankings and to perform logistic regression. The rankings, model results, and descriptive statistics, are reported here. Results showed that a majority of the farmers self-identified as having engaged in adaptive behavior. Out of 14 adaptation strategies, irrigation ranked first among farm adaptive measures, while crop insurance has ranked as least utilized. The logit model explained that out of eight factors surveyed, age, education, family size, farm size, family income, and involvement in cooperatives were significantly related to self-reported adaptation. Despite different support and technological interventions being available, lack of available water, shortage of cultivable land, and unpredictable weather ranked highest as the respondent group's constraints to coping with environmental degradation and change effects. These results provide policy makers and development service providers with important insight, which can be used to better target interventions which build promote or facilitate the adoption of coping mechanisms with potential to build resiliency to changing climate and resulting environmental impacts. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",0.8718831755609402,0.2128270150362934,0.07087971259711003,0.6410736583708521,0.04719770075634759,0.026041349227378656,0.03845846857738241
"THE ROLE OF GROUNDWATER TO MITIGATE THE DROUGHT AND AS AN ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE PHITSANULOK IRRIGATION PROJECT, IN THE NAN BASIN, THAILAND","The Phitsanulok Irrigation Project is located in the Nan Basin of the Upper Central Plain of Thailand where farmers depended on both surface water and groundwater. Land use and climate changes are the important factors to determine the runoff from the watershed. The changes also affected to runoff volume/pattern to the dam operation and may cause flood and drought situations in the downstream area. Sirikit Dam is one of the biggest dams in Thailand which cover about 25 % of the runoff into the Central Plain where the Bangkok Capital is located. Though there is the Sirikit Dams storing water to be used during dry period but water allocation is limited and still caused water shortage during dry season. The study aims to determine the role of groundwater to mitigate the drought situation from the past and to study the groundwater use for adaptation to climate change in The Phitsanulok Irrigation Development Project. In this study, the relationship of recharge rate with climate data was developed in terms of precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature and soil type under monthly time series data and the study found that there were in good relationship. Groundwater will take an important role to alleviate from the water shortage situations in climate change conditions when compared with the situations based on the existing water use pattern. The limit of ground water to alleviate water shortage will be 80 and 77 MCM/year in average, in near future and far future periods to keep water table drawn down in the safe manner even when the Sirikit's reservoir operation rule is improved.",0.7973071962728144,0.24876674777691823,0.22634932001649063,0.2375864517220409,0.031734239356419953,0.0743027519647146,0.48119258499789636
Enhancing food security: Food crop portfolio choice in response to climatic risk in India,"Food security is highly sensitive to climate risks in rainfed areas, particularly in South Asia where agriculture is highly dependent on rainfall. About 56% of India's land mass is agricultural land, and only 43% is net cultivated area; 60% of India's total cropped area is still rain-fed and therefore dependent on the monsoon. Changes in climatic variables such as rainfall can have an adverse impact on output and income, food prices and human health, and the food security. This study considers the combination of food crop choices as one of the ex-ante risk management strategies and examines farm households' food crop portfolio choices as a response to climatic risk in semi-arid tropics of India. Unlike in other countries, intercropping and mixed cropping are prevalent among Indian farmers. Taking this into consideration and data from Indian farms findings show that farmers in semi-arid tropics of India are growing less risky food crop portfolio. Secondly, we find that in the presence of climatic risk, farmers tend to choose less risky crops and as a result less risky food crop portfolios. Finally, in the presence of climatic risk wealthy farmers and farmers with more cash on hand are more likely to choose relatively riskier food crop portfolio.",0.9797325403132848,0.22307205089181964,0.06793155097699342,0.5753262721379047,0.021315971149990363,0.010354103690579302,0.010827695874287262
The perception of and adaptation to climate variability/change in Ghana by small-scale and commercial farmers,"Effective adaptation to climate change and variability is contingent on the perceptions of farmers and the ability of policy makers to merge these with scientific knowledge systems. The study examined the differentiated knowledge, experiences and perceptions of small traditional farmers and modern commercial farmers and their adaptation influences using qualitative interviews. Farmers generally have very clear ideas of the trends in the parameters of climate change as they relate to farm productivity and other livelihoods. Commercial farmers had a better understanding of the science of climate change, but small farmers presented a localised explanation of observed climate changes. Non-climate factors influenced adaptation of both groups of farmers. The capacities of small farmers are lower than their commercial counterparts, but the risks associated with commercial farming are much higher owing to higher investments in uncertain physical and economic conditions. Differentiated policies are needed at climate proofing the investments and efforts of farmers.",0.9866808965334959,0.14758268732420982,0.0694579977841957,0.5309604121912755,0.020229151660547073,0.00937691199545501,0.026087277530675083
"Assessment of climate change vulnerability of farm households in Pyapon District, a delta region in Myanmar","Sea level rise causes saltwater intrusion and flooding of agricultural land and ultimately threatens the livelihoods of farm households in the delta region of Myanmar. Empirical research on the effects of climate change on the delta's agriculture and an assessment of the vulnerability are becoming necessary. This study explores the vulnerability of farm households to sea level rise using two methods: the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI), which is comprised of 37 indicators, and the Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index (SeVI), which contains 35 indicators. Interviews with 178 farmers were conducted in Bogale, Pyapon and Dedaye Townships in Pyapon District. In addition, 7 focus group discussions were performed, with at least 2 discussions in each Township. Both methods identify Bogale to be the most vulnerable Township, followed by Dedaye and Pyapon Townships. Following the LVI approach, Bogale Township has the highest sensitivity to climate effects and the highest exposure to natural hazards, but also a higher adaptive capacity than the other townships. In contrast using the SeVI approach, Bogale was found to have the highest sensitivity and exposure to natural hazards but the lowest adaptive capacity score. The study found that the climate change adaptation measures taken by the farmers are important to limit vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and thus promotion of the adaptive capacity of farmers is important for the delta region of Myanmar.",0.8423403583720301,0.29200595649298555,0.08647472574376694,0.5332768467896999,0.0968628389267322,0.058788466435505726,0.08716282460730841
Maize migration: key crop expands to higher altitudes under climate change in the Andes,"Climate change is expected to profoundly alter the growing conditions of agricultural crops, potentially causing decline in food production in several parts of the world. A switch from crops and crop varieties currently grown to others that are better adapted to new environmental conditions has been suggested as one possible adaptation strategy. While research has documented the upward migration of wild species linked to recent warming in mountain environments, there has been little empirical research on corresponding shifts in the ranges of cultivated species. This study examines changes in the elevation of maize cultivation on the slopes of Mt. Cotacachi, a volcano located in the Northern Ecuadorian highlands. The results show that during the past two decades, farmers in four communities have expanded maize cultivation an estimated 200-300 m in elevation, linked to their observations of climatic and environmental change. This suggests that in tropical mountain regions like the Andes that exhibit closely stacked agroecological zones, the upward movement of local crops and crop varieties constitutes one feasible locally based adaptive response to changes in growing conditions induced by global warming.",0.8761865753289825,0.19764237899190754,0.11244365082380534,0.46013174892982084,0.035964472047857174,0.018442209544045546,0.03221442665664553
Adaptation to Climate Change in Swedish Forestry,"Adaptation to climate change in forestry has become a growing concern, in part due to the impact of storms and other events that have raised the awareness of such risks amongst forest owners. Sweden is one of Europe's most densely-forested countries, with this sector playing a major role economically. However adaptation has, to a large extent, been limited to the provision of recommendations to forest managers, most of which have only been partially implemented. This paper summarizes research with direct implications for adaptation to climate change within the forestry sector in Sweden. The focus is based in particular on providing examples of adaptations that illustrate the specific Swedish orientation to adaptation, in line with its relatively intensive forest management system. The paper thus illustrates a specific Swedish orientation to adaptation through active management, which can be contrasted with approaches to adaptation in other forestry systems, in particular those with limited management or management based on maintaining natural forests in particular.",0.4201133084571197,0.3224916430542438,0.2607690372638181,0.20382848242856888,0.07292434509232637,0.10758737811186449,0.06221353504467274
Patterns of herders' adaptation to changes in social-ecological systems across northern China's grasslands over the past three decades,"Understanding the changes in herders' adaptation to environmental change can provide insight into humans' adaptive mechanisms to different social-ecological systems, and is also important for the optimal management of grasslands. However, the existing and emerging patterns of herders' adaptation to changes in social-ecological systems across different types of grasslands are poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic participatory investigation that was conducted to comprehensively understand herders' adaptation in this context over the past three decades. Three counties in Inner Mongolia grasslands were selected as the case study sites, located in meadow steppe, typical steppe and desert steppe respectively. Our results indicate that herders' perceptions partly fit with the reality of the actual changes. The majority of herders attributed their pasture's quality degradation to reduced precipitation rather than overgrazing, a contradictory perception to previous scientific observations (overgrazing > climate change). Moreover, herders' behaviour in relation to herbage storage and livestock structure had dramatically changed in terms of spatial and temporal patterns in Inner Mongolia, which benefited herders in production efficiency. Lambing time of sheep and goats occurred earlier than it did several decades ago across the three grassland types. This was attributed to a rise in temperature, increasing marketisation and developing infrastructure. In addition, there became evident a transformation in the animal husbandry production cycle from a two-year to one-year cycle. Our results highlighted that the transformation of herders' behavioural strategies resulted from variations in spatial and temporal patterns of climate change, pasture degradation, new policies and marketisation in pastoral areas. These strategies can be seen as key mechanisms in long-term adaptation to changes in social-ecological systems, which benefit herders' efficiency in grassland management.",0.7196596157037475,0.3433522265342923,0.20448063460355356,0.37421609294406083,0.06856139311473272,0.05345661718984117,0.04626362334881076
Simulating agricultural land-use adaptation decisions to climate change: An empirical agent-based modelling in northern Ghana,"In West Africa, the majority of regional climate projections for the region predict that the study area will become warmer and that precipitation patterns will be more erratic. The aim of this article is to examine local agricultural adaptation to climate change and variability in a semi-arid area of the Upper East Region of Ghana. This is performed by integrating the two-step decision making sub-models, Perception-of-Climate-Change and Adaptation-Choice-Strategies, to the Land Use Dynamic Simulator (LUDAS). The simulation results suggest that the land-use choices in the study area reflect a tendency towards increasing subsistence farming in an area where there has been a gradual trend away from traditional land uses such as cereal production to the cultivation of groundnut, rice, maize and soybean. Groundnut monoculture production has emerged locally as coping measure for dealing with increased climatic variability. In terms of livelihood strategy, there is an increasing contribution of rice and groundnut to household gross incomes. The predicted pattern of changes in gross household income under a scenario in which climate change is perceived by local farmers explicitly revealed the contribution of adaptation options to household livelihood strategy.",0.8889178516865954,0.2506385791681164,0.12318537229613888,0.5469796478004081,0.03605337925849477,0.02383036129466326,0.021525985153412627
Irrigation Technology Choice as Adaptation to Climate Change in the Western United States,"Several commentators have suggested adoption of improved irrigation will be important for agricultural adaptation to climate change. This study used data from a special tabulation of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey to examine how climate and other factors influence the choice of sprinkler versus gravity-flow irrigation across 17 western states. Because studies of irrigation technology adoption often concentrate on small geographic areas with the same climate, few have estimated effects of climate on irrigation technology choice. Results suggest sprinkler irrigation is a more promising climate adaptation in areas that are relatively cooler and where extreme precipitation events increase. Sprinkler adoption is less likely in warmer climates and under drier climate change scenarios. An implication is that for hot, arid parts of the West, other climate adaptation strategies may be more important to pursue. Consistent with several previous studies, sprinkler adoption was greater among farms that were larger, had higher water costs, and relied more on groundwater. Sprinkler adoption was also greater in states with a higher erosion index that captured effects of rainfall, field slope, and soil water-holding capacity, which also have been found to be important adoption predictors in a number of previous studies.",0.8636468009536133,0.23320454332011362,0.0722656568982652,0.2637962216476242,0.032321425796508776,0.0789103813200673,0.14692359539173155
Building climate change resilience through local cooperation: a Peruvian Andes case study,"Many of the problems faced by international projects intending to create adaptive social-ecological systems for climate change stem from lack of stakeholder engagement, limited understanding of local political, economic, and environmental complexities, and restricted time. Local organizations focused on conservation and development might have an advantage in creating adaptive social-ecological systems because they understand local processes and are involved with communities for extended periods of time. A local non-governmental organization, Asociacin Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN), works in twenty-one communities in the Andean highlands outside of Cusco to conserve the endangered Polylepis forests. As part of the conservation project, ECOAN supports community-led development projects such as building greenhouses. Data for this project were gathered through interviews (with community members in three different communities, ECOAN staff, and donors) and participant observation. This paper shows that ECOAN's extensive use of participation has led to community ownership of the conservation and development projects. The communities' close connections to the Polylepis project contribute to resilience through creating networks, extending the local environmental ethic to the Polylepis trees, supporting projects that diversify and strengthen community sustenance, and contributing to the growth of economic activities. This case study provides a positive example of the potential for local organizations and people to take charge of their own resiliency efforts where international projects and protocols may otherwise prove ineffective.",0.36453226603891276,0.4411564040391022,0.18367482643637884,0.4794546197523263,0.12165021091408715,0.04558857420724491,0.17505579382879177
Integrated Adaptation Management Approach toward Sustained Fish Production by Fish Farmers of Marilao-Meycauayan-Obando River System,"This study was conducted to profile the fish farm owners/operators (known as fish farmers) at the Marilao-Meycauayan-Obando River System (MMORS) and to determine their current fish farm management practices (FFMPs) and concerns encountered in fish farming. Characterizing the fish farmers enabled the formulation of appropriate adaptation interventions that may serve as inputs for management strategies and rehabilitation efforts to address water pollution. In doing so, sustainable fish production could be assured. Focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and a survey were conducted. The survey sampling size was proportionally allocated among municipalities covered in this study. Half of the respondents were full-time fish farmers and received an estimated monthly income of USD 125-250. The majority (60%) managed small ponds (4 ha and below), which were used for rearing and nursery or rearing and transition of fingerlings or fry. Many rented fish farms through lease agreement with private owners (78%); they mostly grew milkfish (74%) and tilapia (41%), but a few also raised prawns (18%) and shrimps (12%). The fish farmers' major issues include flooding due to changing climate patterns (74), water pollution (21), and presence of invasive species (20). Their adaptation strategies include technological changes including FFMPs. However, institutional arrangements are crucial to ensure sustainability and productivity. The study recommends the adoption of an integrated social-technological approach called CARE solution, which refer to Community Action by organizing the fishery sector; long-term Rehabilitation by integrating efforts of all stakeholders through the MMO Water Quality Management Area Board; and Enforcement of environmental laws. This approach is congruent with the Ecosystem Approach for Aquaculture that integrates ecosystem, human well-being and equity, and incorporates other sectors for aquaculture development and management. The fish farm management baseline study results could be an input in developing specific interventions using the CARE solution framework in the MMORS cleanup and rehabilitation. This approach could help in the design of interventions that aim to achieve enhanced socio-ecological health and ecosystem services for improved and sustained socioeconomic productivity.",0.8420418466484315,0.2240344815649821,0.17141512917117258,0.36192870966451535,0.07038374637395009,0.033314011569732196,0.06612264896828218
Drivers of change and adaptation pathways of agricultural systems facing increased salinity intrusion in coastal areas of the Mekong and Red River deltas in Vietnam,"Agricultural systems are increasingly considered complex adaptive systems. They are dependent on the integrated nature of biophysical and social sub-systems, continuously adapt to changing conditions and often display non-linear responses to various drivers of change at multiple scales. This research applied the lens of complex adaptive systems theory to analyze current and historical drivers of change and adaptation pathways of agricultural systems to increased salinity intrusion in coastal areas of the Red River and Mekong deltas in Vietnam since 1975, The analysis is based on 27 in-depth interviews with officials of local and national authorities as well as 198 semi-structured interviews and 11 focus group discussions conducted with farmers along three salinity transects in both deltas in 2015-2016. The results show that a dynamic interplay and feedback of various drivers of change such as policy intervention, farmers' desire for profit maximization, changing salinity conditions, and technological development at different levels of the deltaic social-ecological system have shaped the changes and adaptations in agricultural systems over the last decades. In response to increased salinity intrusion, as exemplified by the historic salinity levels recorded in the Mekong Delta in 2015-2016, various adaptation options have been considered. These include adaptations that would lock-in agricultural production in particular systems or constrain changes in others, which is potentially problematic in light of the high uncertainty related to future changes. The study recognizes the need to apply both incremental and transformative changes and select adaptation pathways which allow for continuous change or that are reversible in order to avoid lock-ins and address future challenges. Additionally, attention should be drawn to interactions and feedbacks in future changes within and across adaptation pathways in order to prevent further increases in salinity intrusion and lock-in effects in agricultural systems within the deltas.",0.7598602177862511,0.3108131401680972,0.19484897525722344,0.36956900237777957,0.2142365430515446,0.02983033455849809,0.08924642282619903
Agroforestry in Bolivia: opportunities and challenges in the context of food security and food sovereignty,"Agroforestry systems have long been implemented in Bolivia, but little is known about their overall current status. Interviews with farmers, policymakers and members of civil society organizations about the challenges and opportunities that agroforestry faces, as well as field visits to agroforestry projects revealed a wide range of agroforestry initiatives in Bolivia that provide ecosystem services, food and income to local families. All interviewees attributed a high potential to agroforestry, for example, to promote biodiversity, water conservation, food sovereignty and adaptation to climate change impacts. However, agroforestry initiatives lacked support because government incentives were channelled to cattle rearing and large-scale monocultures rather than diversified farming systems, and agroforestry initiatives tended to be small and isolated. A nationwide policy is needed which is coordinated with civil society organizations and individual farmers and strategically and efficiently supports agroforestry initiatives-especially in the most vulnerable first years of establishment-through extension services and access to materials, markets, knowledge and financial resources.",0.8115475387168966,0.2724107278371464,0.16290119317815735,0.5562878001087197,0.0499491236739356,0.034391013281909896,0.05927393001455562
Rainfall scarcity and its impacts on subsistence farming: the role of gender and religious rituals in adaptation to change,"The study examined the impacts of rainfall scarcity on subsistence crop production. It describes the importance of religious rituals performed by women as adaptation measures to erratic rainfall patterns. This study is motivated by observations that unpredictable rainfall has diverse impacts on food security in rural communities that still depend on subsistence economies to supplement food sources. Focus group discussions with 50 women aged between 35 and 78 years revealed that the women draw on cultural knowledge as subsistence crop producers. They depend on rain-making, seed-dressing and crop maintenance rituals to adapt to rainfall scarcity hazards such as drought. These measures ensure food self-sufficiency in the face of climate change. The findings of this study could be used to improve the status of women by fostering their participation and use of their indigenous knowledge to increase food security in development programmes intended to end hunger and famine in the rural areas.",0.940110844809315,0.29370272792459307,0.08402953873159401,0.5829207828078695,0.04170219854588391,0.01616973601650818,0.10054684498475404
Adoption status of direct seeded rice cultivation technology in Haryana,"The study focused on assessment of adoption of DSR cultivation technology in the state since it being a most feasible and sustainable alternative rice-ecosystem in view of depleting water resources, reduced labour use and climate risks being major concerns in conventional method of cultivation of rice. The overall adoption of DSR technology was low to moderate since 70% respondents belonged to these categories. The study revealed that method of sowing, depth of sowing, seed treatment, fiat pan nozzle use for spray, land preparation and use of recommended weedicides were highly adopted agronomic practices, whereas least adopted practices were like recommended seed rate; timely application of fertilizers and their recommended doses, and ferrous sulphate use only at deficiency syndrome not as per recommended schedule.",0.8864777970589257,0.22167777255705157,0.12301221452376468,0.4440698542882819,0.04461861673050006,0.046408069524211885,0.06309365342250237

Socio-hydrological Framework of Farmer-Drought Feedback: Darfur as a Case Study,"This paper attempts to conceptualize key socio-hydrological feedback loops between farmers and drought phenomena. To this end, two-fold aspects are considered for the Darfur region in the west of Sudan. The first one is the understanding of farmers' perception of the major drought conditions, i.e. changes in patterns of rainfall and increase in temperature, in the region in comparison to the observed trends and variability (meteorological records). The second aspect is the identification of the types of concordant adjustments in the farming practices those farmers have made in response to drought conditions. Scheduled interviews composed of 98 farmers formed the basis of establishing the socio-hydrological framework. The interview results are discussed under the reality of human conflict in the context of a prototype cause-effect approach to defining the framework of drivers, pressures, state, impacts and responses (DPSIR) in the farmer-drought system. Climate in the region shows different features of drought, including increasing rainfall variability, changes in wet-season structure to which crop growth is sensitive, and increasing temperatures. Farmers have stronger perception of changes in rainfall patterns than in temperature. They rank the former as the main factor behind the declining crop; however, the results also suggest poor soil fertility as additional important agent. To reduce the drought risk to farming in the region and enhance crop productivity, farmers use a variety of strategies, such as early planting, frequent weeding, diversification of crops, cultivation of early maturing varieties and soil conservation.

Hapa irrigation for promoting sustainable agricultural intensification: experience from Bankura district of India,"This research examines the implications of rainwater harvesting structure hapa in the Bankura district of West Bengal, India. The paper finds that proper management and harvesting of surface and subsurface runoffs in hapas can facilitate groundwater recharge and increase both net irrigated area and moisture in soil leading to higher cropping intensity and yield in dryland areas. However, dissected plateau and residual hillocks can reduce irrigation efficiency of hapas. Although sprinkler or drip irrigation along with cultivation of drought and lateritic resilient, low moisture crop can help in coping up with geophysical and climatic vulnerability, appropriate crop diversification is also necessary. There is also a need for regular maintenance and desiltation of hapas. The water user groups should play an active role for this, especially for hapas in common land. Further, scientific guidance is necessary for designing appropriate structure of hapas in different geo-physical conditions. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",0.8100014101052582,0.2660866353206677,0.12028438648463881,0.41673357020766655,0.050886395677344924,0.04492477654416902,0.2463187438303036
"Can more drought resistant crops promote more climate secure agriculture? Prospects and challenges of millet cultivation in Ananthapur, Andhra Pradesh","Amidst growing concerns about the threats posed by climate change for rural livelihoods, policy makers have given increasing attention to the need for more climate secure agriculture. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities of encouraging the cultivation of millets, a class of coarse grain cereals that are both water efficient and drought resistant, which are prominently grown in rainfed regions of the developing world. Based on a qualitative study in the Ananthapur District of Andhra Pradesh, India, we explore how millets factor into households’ production strategies and their role as a risk response strategy. Millets, we found, play an important role in mitigating households’ exposure to climate risk, both by diversifying production portfolios and as a contingency crop to confront delayed rains at planting time. Nonetheless, there remain important limitations for the viability of millets due to their low income generating capacity. To have a more significant impact on welfare and sustainability, policy needs to address the structural conditions of vulnerability that limit the viability of more secure livelihoods. We explore some of the ways that state intervention can make millets more viable by enhancing their terms of marketability and by providing other kinds of support. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",0.7009631547662153,0.2924243373744042,0.08847949419810451,0.4809796986188775,0.053962585327597797,0.06584037149550524,0.10360185171355017
"Perceived impacts of climate change, coastal development and policy on oyster harvesting in the Southeastern United States","Oyster harvest has long been an important industry of the eastern coast of the United States. However, coastal development, overfishing and climate change are threatening this industry and way of life. This study examines the perspectives of oyster harvesters and merchants in Brunswick County, North Carolina, USA to explore their capacity to adapt to these changing conditions. Using in-person, semi-structured interviews researchers collected information from seventeen interviewees, generating qualitative data that were analyzed using MAXQDA software. From the data collected several themes emerged revealing mixed sentiments on the impacts of climate change but a widespread sense that development and regulations threaten livelihoods and cultural heritage. This social-ecological system (SES), created through centuries of regulation, is experiencing rapid population growth with concurrent coastal development; it also includes oyster industry workers who have limited voice in decision-making but are affected by the political ecology of the region. Deliberately including oyster harvesters and merchants when formulating and implementing policy can help to strengthen the adaptive capacity of this SES while sustaining Brunswick County's coastal heritage.

"Inuit Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), Subsistence Hunting and Adaptation to Climate Change in the Canadian Arctic","This paper examines the role of Inuit traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in adaptation to climate change in the Canadian Arctic. It focuses on Inuit relationships with the Arctic environment, including hunting knowledge and land skills, and examines their roles in adaptation to biophysical changes that affect subsistence hunting. In several instances, TEK underpins competency in subsistence and adaptations to changing conditions, which includes flexibility with regard to seasonal cycles of hunting and resource use, hazard avoidance through detailed knowledge of the environment and understanding of ecosystem processes, and emergency preparedness, e.g., knowing what supplies to take when traveling and how to respond in emergency situations. Despite the documented importance of TEK in adaptation and in maintaining a level of competency in subsistence, the relationships between TEK and adaptation to climate change are not well defined in the scholarly literature. This paper aims to conceptualize the relationships between TEK and adaptation to climate change by di-awing on case study research with Inuit in the Canadian Arctic. TEK is considered an element of adaptive capacity (or resilience) that is expressed as adaptation if TEK is drawn upon to adapt to changing conditions. This capacity depends on the development, accumulation, and transmission of TEK within and among generations.",0.3346818722249916,0.4322597872962034,0.21144683775136303,0.3830228411626185,0.19111885493366543,0.04872689576061409,0.09967133961697833
EXAMINING THE DRIVERS OF AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTATION AMONG SMALLHOLDER FARMERS IN MALAWI,"Smallholder farmers in Malawi are faced with the challenge of managing complex and dynamic farming systems while also adapting to change within volatile agroecological conditions. Moreover, management decisions are influenced by a combination of local knowledge, expert recommendations and on-farm experimentation. Although many smallholder farmers actively experiment with new crops and technologies, little is known about the prevalence of experimentation or the types of experiments farmers conduct. This study examined the decision-making processes of experimenting farmers to explore the drivers of on-farm experimentation. Using a mixed-methods design that incorporated field observations, survey data and in-depth interviews, we identified numerous examples of experiments with new crops, varieties and techniques that had been executed either independently or through participation in an agricultural development project. Results of quantitative and qualitative analysis reveal that smallholder farmers in Malawi across a range of socioeconomic characteristics are inclined to experiment, and gender roles in agricultural experimentation vary widely. While experimental methods differ between farmers, there are commonalities in the drivers of experimentation, including adapting to climate change, improving soil health, improving nutrition and generating income. Smallholders have a great capacity for experimentation, and their knowledge, experience, preferences and priorities - if properly understood and incorporated - could ultimately benefit both future agricultural development projects and their participants.",0.9240375140937985,0.22037961554021634,0.09926124055677563,0.5,0.02711876191998715,0.030287402208817427,0.03541852764966596
"Farm-level adaptation to climate change in Western Bangladesh: An analysis of adaptation dynamics, profitability and risks","Using long-term district-level climate data and a case study from a drought-prone village in western Bangladesh, this research explored trends in climate change, and analysed farmers' adaptation dynamics, profitability and risks. This is the first study of its kind for drought-prone areas in Bangladesh. Farmers perceived climate changes included increases in temperature and decreases in rainfall which were as consistent with the trends of Chuadanga climate records. Farmers' adaptation measures included changes in cropping systems, cropping calendars, crop varieties, agronomic practices, crop diversification and improved animal'husbandry. Reducing environmental stress, ensuring self-sufficiency in staple crops (mainly rice) and other crop production practices, and enhancing economic viability of farm enterprises have underpinned these adaptations. Off-farm and non-farm wage employment, temporary migration, self-employment and educating children, constituted the core non-farm adaptation strategies. Emerging cropping systems like maize/cucumber and maize/stem amaranth/rice were economically more viable than the traditional rice/rice and rice/maize systems. Despite some uncertainties, farming was preferred to off-farm work, generating higher returns to labour for all cropping systems. Limited access to stress-tolerant varieties, extension services and affordable agricultural credit, combined with high production costs, variability in crop yields and output mites, are the main barriers to adaptation. Stronger agricultural research and support services, affordable credit, community-focussed farming education and training are critically important for effective adaptation to climate change.

Livelihood diversification as an adaptation approach to change in the pastoral Hindu-Kush Himalayan region,"Migratory livestock raising has been one of the most important livelihood options for people residing in high mountain areas and has made a significant contribution to the economy of the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, both in terms of supporting households and in export earnings. However, in recent decades, changes in the socioeconomic situation and increasing climate variability have led to a need to enhance adaptation by building the resilience of local socio-ecological systems, including economic diversification and sustainable management of natural resources. Based on semi-structured interviews with pastoral communities in six countries within the pastoral HKH region, this paper discusses the situation, trends and driving forces behind the diversification of pastoral livelihood. For internal diversification the study highlights the need for enhancement of pastoral livelihoods through value-adding activities in the pastoral sectors. For external diversification changes on policy changes are needed to support free out-migration, market exploitation, and multiple resource use. Finally the paper highlights the role of education in determining household adaptation strategies in the face of various socio-ecological pressures and recommends integrating innovative and indigenous knowledge to develop appropriate methods for risk management and resource management in the pastoral HKH region.",0.779734612640516,0.33324616583228683,0.2424165309840106,0.6100950350788223,0.06195138653633149,0.030778648229420533,0.10217065889144183
Climate variability and status of the production and diversity of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) in the arid zone of northwest Benin,"Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an important staple food in semi-arid tropics which contribute to food security and poverty alleviation in Benin. However, its production is seriously facing enormous abiotic and biotic stresses including climate variability. To document its cultivar diversity, the impact of climate change on its production and diversity, the adaptation strategies developed by farmers and the performance of landraces, 22 villages were randomly selected and surveyed in the Department of Atakora in the northwest of Benin using participatory research appraisals (fields and granaries visit, individual and group survey using questionnaires, Four cells or distribution and extent analysis, etc.). Data were analysed through descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, means, etc.) to generate summaries and tables at different (villages, individuals) levels and also through multivariate analysis (cluster analysis) and the results figures. In total 8 constraints affecting sorghum production were recorded among which striga proliferation, soil poverty and climate change effects (drought; excess of rain; delay, insufficient and irregular rainfall, etc.) were the most important. Subject to synonyms, 89 sorghum landraces were inventoried and their number varied from 4 to 17 (7 on average) per village. The Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H) estimated at 3.02 indicated high sorghum diversity in the study area. Many landraces were threatened. The relatively high rates (16.7-88.2 %; 40.9 % on average) of cultivars loss recorded per village are proofs of menace of genetic erosion and necessity of developing conservation strategies. Inadaptability of cultivars to climate variability (39.6 % of abandoned landraces) was among others the most important reason justifying the loss of diversity. Crop rotations, growing of early maturing and/or drought tolerant landraces, establishment of fields in lowlands are the most important strategies developed by farmers to mitigate impacts of climate change (low productivity, increase of damages from storage insects, early drying of plant leaves etc.) on the crop. Participatory evaluation of the existing landraces led to the identification of some high-performing ones that are resistant/tolerant to diverse abiotic and biotic stresses. Farmers' cultivars preference criteria were identified and prioritized. Results of this study are useful to policy makers, agricultural extension services of the different districts, genetic resources specialists and breeders in order to improve sorghum production in Benin.",0.9623402430876578,0.19341069987786103,0.08418701793761015,0.5466907450578072,0.016564494728116358,0.025035957525938048,0.019083582263034353
Moving the Conversation on Climate Change and Inequality to the Local: Socio-ecological Vulnerability in Agricultural Tanzania.,"Climate change is expected to shift seasonality in Tanzania, while smallholder farmers' livelihoods and the economy rely upon the success of rainfed agriculture. However, we should not a priori assume doomsday climate vulnerability scenarios of drought and devastation in the rural global South nor, on the other hand, that farmers will optimally employ local knowledge for effective adaptation. Drawing from qualitative fieldwork in two Tanzanian communities, I question these grand narratives of devastation and local adaptive capacity and introduce an approach that brings inequality to the center. Poorer nations are most vulnerable to climate change, but they are not homogenous and neither are the smallholder farmers living within them. I present evidence on the crucial context-specific dimensions of socio-ecological vulnerability for these smallholder farmers-1) water resources and access to them; 2) agricultural knowledge, including farmers' own knowledge and their interactions with sources like government-run agricultural extension and NGOs; and 3) existing drought-coping strategies-and the heterogeneity among farmers across these dimensions. Ultimately, this case demonstrates how climate change can reproduce existing inequalities within nations by drawing upon how farmers currently respond to drought as evidence. I present the difficult and somewhat bleak contexts within which the farmers are coping, but also illustrate the agency that farmers exhibit in response to these conditions and the adaptive capacity they possess. Finally, I call for more sub-national research on climate and inequality by sociologists and draw connections among within-nation inequality, climate change, and agricultural development initiatives.",0.9677637627671,0.22232657961924904,0.0854538024510294,0.5721868292609734,0.020846182072811144,0.01443548398032079,0.07917284621315043
"Analysis of Farmer's Choices for Climate Change Adaptation Practices in South-Western Uganda, 1980-2009","Climate change is a serious threat to the livelihoods of rural communities, particularly in mountainous areas because they are very sensitive to such changes. In this study, we assessed the household determinants to climate change adaptation drawing from a case study of agricultural adaptation in the Mount Rwenzori area of South Western Uganda. The study identified the major adaptation practices that are adopted by farmers to cope with the impacts of climate change and using available on-farm technologies. A total of 143 smallholder farmers were sampled and interviewed using field based questionnaires, field observations, and key informant interviews. Data was cleaned, entered and analysed using SPSS and Stata software for descriptive statistics. Thereafter, a Multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the drivers of farmers' choice for adaptation practices, factors influencing the choice of adaptation, and barriers. The major adaptation practices that were identified included; use of different crop varieties, tree planting, soil and water conservation, early and late planting, and furrow irrigation. Discrete choice model results indicated the age of the household head, experience in farming, household size, climate change shocks, land size, use of agricultural inputs, landscape position (location), and crop yield varied significantly (p > 0.05), which influenced farmers' choice of climate change adaptation practices. The main barriers to adaptation included inadequate information on adaptation methods and financial constraints, leading us to conclude that contextual adaptation practices are more desirable for adoption to farmers. Adapting to climate change needs support from government and other stakeholders, however the implementation is more successful when appropriate and suitable choices are employed.",0.9861090329934207,0.14742944139057368,0.08951457094074447,0.5965521484477585,0.01065872920503761,0.011298685887425452,0.012022861033494257
Agriculture under changing climate conditions and adaptation options in the Koshi Basin,"Using biophysical and social analysis methods, this paper evaluated agricultural practices under changing climate in the Koshi Basin and assessed adaptation options. Agricultural trend analysis showed that in the recent three to four decades, the total cultivated area had declined in all parts of the basin except in the Nepal Mountain Region. Household survey results also confirmed such decline and further revealed shifts towards non-agricultural activities. Climate trend analysis showed changes in the frequency of wet and dry days in study districts, implying an increasing chance of flood and drought events. Household surveys further revealed that, in general, people perceived a decline in agricultural water availability and an increase in drought and flood events. The direct impacts of these changes were reduced crop yield, increased fallow lands, displacement of people from settlement areas, sedimentation of cultivable land and damage to properties. Household surveys showed that despite the perceived impacts on agriculture and livelihoods, only limited adaptation options are currently practised. Adaptation efforts are constrained by several factors, including: finance; technical knowledge; lack of awareness about adaptation options; lack of collective action; unclear property rights; and ineffective role of state agencies.",0.8166741953407849,0.2450179711911387,0.1094781242835516,0.4345753254452021,0.057041376244556144,0.0606335610748616,0.3096847957114069
Impact of climate change on brackish water aquaculture development in the coastal areas of Niger Delta,"The issue of climate change has generated a lot of concern among the general public in Niger Delta region in recent time. It has been described in different ways by many people based on their views, perception and understanding. However, little considerations have been given to the impact of climate change on brackish water aquaculture in the coastal areas of Niger Delta. This study therefore, review critically, based on existing literature and field experience, the causes of climate change, impact of climate change on aquaculture production such as: increase in temperature, flooding of ponds, increase in water turbidity, heavy siltation of pond bottom, introduction of new species, collapse of farms infrastructure and fluctuations in salinity levels. Also, various adaptation and mitigation strategies that will ameliorate the impact of climate change in aquaculture operations, namely: reduction in human activities that are inimical to stable climate, selection of good site suitable for fish farming, provision of shading materials for fish cultured in tanks, raising of pond dykes, good management practices and improvement of monitoring and early warning systems are explicitly elucidated. As these strategies will go a long way in minimizing the impact of this menace, in the brackish water zone of the region. Moreover, efforts should be made by relevant institutions and agencies to come up with coordinated plans and policies that will reduce the effects of climate change on brackish water aquaculture in the coastal areas of Niger Delta. © 2015 Academic Journals Inc.",0.6759078895238749,0.2192883422845705,0.15652391439148786,0.24803149265580438,0.14983678916319945,0.11549772669671811,0.20358805952628561
A guide towards climate change adaptation in the livestock sector: adaptation options and the role of robust decision-making tools for their economic appraisal,"Economic appraisal and technical effectiveness of adaptation options are key criteria for judging climate change adaptation investment decisions in all sectors. Yet relatively little methodological guidance exists for determining the most appropriate appraisal techniques for different adaptation options. This paper provides adaptation options and scopes relevant appraisal methods in agriculture focussing on livestock production specifically. We find that for many adaptation options for livestock agriculture, standard (expected) cost-benefit analysis is an appropriate tool. For adaptation options requiring long lead times or those with long lifetimes, techniques incorporating uncertainty ('robust' methods) are more suitable, including real options analysis, portfolio analysis and robust decision-making. From a comprehensive list of adaptation options in the livestock sector, we identify the most appropriate appraisal technique for each option and describe how the robust appraisal tools could be applied to heat stress, flood risk and water management.",0.5110198073077394,0.3094086973114401,0.15045890027738748,0.26720593108762275,0.08162283263208503,0.18810004379708248,0.10667056941284289
Improving a pavement-watering method on the basis of pavement surface temperature measurements,"Pavement-watering has been studied since the 1990's and is currently considered a promising tool for urban heat island reduction and climate change adaptation. However, possible future water resource availability problems require that water consumption be optimized. Although pavement heat flux can be studied to improve pavement-watering methods (frequency and water consumption), these measurements are costly and require invasive construction work to install appropriate sensors in a dense urban environment. Therefore, we analyzed infrared camera measurements of pavement surface temperatures in search of alternative information relevant to this goal. Firstly, surface temperature reductions of up to 4. °C during shading and 13. °C during insolation were found. Secondly, the infrared camera successfully detected temperature spikes indicative of surface drying and can therefore be used to optimize the watering frequency. Measurements made every 5. min or less are recommended to minimize relevant data loss. Finally, if the water retaining capacity of the studied pavement is known, optimization of total water consumption is possible on the sole basis of surface temperature measurements. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",0.34559898863776045,0.32782595364083317,0.12957083657395083,0.23407475874228817,0.06781864532951659,0.2547927906163844,0.6073986898511131
"Exploring relationship between social inequality and adaptations to climate change: evidence from urban household surveys in the Yangtze River delta, China","This research enhances our understanding of the complex relationship between climate change, social inequality, and adaption, in urban areas. It is novel, being the first research in this area to be based on a conceptual econometric framework within which multiple stages are explicitly developed, and for which empirical evidence is gathered. We use this approach to examine the role of material, social status, and power inequality in influencing spontaneous adaptation choices in urban settings of China's Yangtze River delta. This framework differentiates two vital stages in adaptation decision making at the household level which allows us to examine, first, how social inequality shapes the severity of climate impact and, second, how social inequality interacts with this experience to influence responses to these impacts. We pilot this approach in selected metropolitan areas of Shanghai and Nanjing. Our results show that all dimensions of social inequality are significantly associated with experiences of climate change and adaptation choice. Application of our conceptual framework provides policymakers and planners with a new and useful tool that can be used to formulate better policy measures that either enable the disadvantaged to adapt in situ or provide these groups with real opportunities and capacities to migrate.",0.19091135491368705,0.4678266687208498,0.13457392143264774,0.3092488447781358,0.11648638071285387,0.2048829610036141,0.11324835948174493
From Risk Governance to City-Citizen Collaboration: Capitalizing on individual adaptation to climate change,"Urban societies are increasingly affected by climatic variability and extremes. In theory, adaptation policy creates the conditions needed to support autonomous adaptation - or deliver public adaptation if autonomous adaptation fails to develop. However, little attention has been given to autonomous adaptation by private households and individuals, and how it is taken into account in cities' strategic adaptation planning. Against this background, this paper examines the synergies between measures taken by city authorities and citizens, and, more specifically, how public adaptation planning enhances or inhibits private (individual) adaptation. Based on a literature review and an in-depth study of German municipalities, existing types of city-citizen interaction are systematized. The results show that targeted city-citizen collaboration for climate change adaptation is practically non-existent. City authorities rarely pay sufficient attention to financial and structural aid for individual adaptation. Conversely, the available municipal support for individual adaptation has little take-up by members of the public. Furthermore, urban policy and planning often counteract collaboration and the implementation of measures that meet citizens' capacities and needs. The paper concludes that improving city-citizen collaboration for adaptation co-production is an important step in fostering transformative adaptation, if the barriers and driving forces identified in the study are addressed. The framework that is presented advances theory on city-citizen interactions for adaptation co-production, providing a basis for related analyses, action and further research. (c) 2016 The Authors.

Factors contributing to business actions in response to climate change in Korea,"Climate change is a growing problem and has been highlighted as a global issue. Empirical evidence increasingly indicates its obvious potential risks to humans and society. As members of this society, business organizations face greatly diverse climate change-related risks that they must recognize and respond to. However, gaps exist between scientific evidence and the actions of business organizations. Few empirical studies have examined the business organizations' actions taken in response to climate change in Korea. This paper addresses this critical gap in the climate change literature by examining business organizations' behaviors and identifying the factors influencing their actions. We employ statistical models to compare corporate climate change actions, and we explain their variations using survey data. The results indicate that despite increasing concerns about climate change, businesses have implemented very limited precautionary mitigation and adaptation actions. In addition, the concerns of the businesses about future climate change impact, organizational capacity (leadership, staff capacity, existence of a relevant division or department), and business size are significant factors with respect to the implementation of climate change actions.",0.34095748641365653,0.3040397501882687,0.12478862156394284,0.26396128536083624,0.06953632634351593,0.08891587080539129,0.08667872514713258
Assessing the economy-wide effects of climate change adaptation options of land transport systems in Austria,"Due to climate change, transport systems are expected to become increasingly stressed by extreme weather and gradual climatic changes, resulting in direct costs within the affected sectors as well as indirect costs from sectoral interlinkages. To reduce these costs, sector-specific climate change adaptation measures are needed, raising the question of the net benefits of adaptation at a macroeconomic level. However, despite their importance such assessments of impacts and adaptation at the macrolevel are scarce and coarse in their implementation. This paper contributes to fill this research gap by analyzing specific adaptation measures for the road and rail sectors in Austria using a computable general equilibrium model. The findings are as follows: First, direct impact costs more than double due to macroeconomic linkages. Hence, the indirect costs are found to be larger than the direct costs. Second, when analyzing adaptation measures for the road and rail sectors, without capturing any indirect effects, benefit-cost ratios imply a clear benefit only for the rail sector. However, when indirect effects via sectoral interlinkages are also captured, adaptation measures in both sectors, road and rail, clearly pay off. Climate change-induced GDP and welfare losses are reduced by 55 and 34% and lead to positive employment effects. Third, even at rather low damage reduction potentials, adaptation leads to a net benefit at the macroeconomic level.",0.25300632695475916,0.30292457180789484,0.1365715437727265,0.23744692938408105,0.05827824827398886,0.30613612907256676,0.1810843167883002
Measuring climatic impacts on energy consumption: A review of the empirical literature,"This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between climate and the energy sector. In particular, we primarily discuss empirical papers published in peer-reviewed economics journals focusing on how climate affects energy expenditures and consumption. Climate will affect energy consumption by changing how consumers respond to short run weather shocks (the intensive margin) as well as how people will adapt in the long run (the extensive margin). Along the intensive margin, further research that uses household and firm-level panel data of energy consumption may help identify how energy consumers around the world respond to weather shocks. Research on technology adoption, e.g. air conditioners, will further our understanding of the extensive margin adjustments and their costs. We also note that most of the literature focuses on the residential sector. Similar studies are urgently needed for the industrial and commercial sectors. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Local level climate justice? Adaptation finance and vulnerability reduction,"Climate change creates a double inequality through the inverse distribution of risk and responsibility. Developed states are responsible, but are forecast to confront only moderate adverse effects; least developed states are not culpable and yet experience significant threats to livelihoods, assets and security. Adaptation finance addresses inequity by developed states facilitating/funding behaviour adjustments necessary for exposed communities to lessen climate risk. This article investigates the ground-level effectiveness of adaptation finance in climate vulnerable villages across Malawi, while controlling for disparities in vulnerability. Malawi and selected districts are both climate vulnerable and significant recipients of adaptation finance. This concludes a larger top-down multi-scalar analysis of climate justice, which applies the distribution and effectiveness of adaptation finance as a proxy. The study avails of participatory assessments to compare actions of villages receiving adaptation finance with those engaging in autonomous and informal adaptations. Adaptation finance villages: (a) address more climate related risks; and (b) enhance agency, security and sustainably lessen climate vulnerability. Conversely, informal practice villages attend to a lower proportion of climate risks and often develop short-term strategies with less enduring vulnerability reduction. Vulnerable communities receiving adaptation finance do change behaviours to reduce climate risk and thus secure local level climate justice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Discovering and characterizing farm households' resilience under water scarcity,"Water scarcity at an alarming rate has been a limiting factor for sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid environments of the world. It has resulted in a number of problems such as poverty and food insecurity among farm households. Therefore, building and improving resilience, as a way to mitigate the impacts of water scarcity, is important for farm households. But one of the significant steps for planning to improve farm households' resilience under water scarcity is investigation of the current level of resilience of these households and understanding their variances. Therefore, this study offers a classification of farm households' diversity based on resilience. Primary data were collected from 260 randomly selected farm households in 21 villages around Parishan wetland, Iran. Farm Household Resilience Scale was used to measure resilience. Cluster analysis suggested three groups: highly, medium-, and low-resilient farm households. The results of comparing three groups revealed that highly resilient farm households characterize with higher risk management, more agricultural water security, more positive psychological traits, and better knowledge management. Also, they had better water quality, attended more agricultural extension activities, and used modern irrigation systems. Farm households' resilience map using GIS software illustrated that there is a relationship between resilience and farm location from the wetland. The findings of this study could be used by planner and policy-makers to improve farm households' resilience in arid and semi-arid environments. Improvement in knowledge management system is recommended as one of the most effective policy instruments in building resilience.",0.9066655407118713,0.2322415976236782,0.0908799698982931,0.5489041516445936,0.042761721506184486,0.0463813524974892,0.19183160168704014

Social protection as a strategy to address climate-induced migration,"Purpose - This paper aims to discuss the roles of social protection in reducing and facilitating climate-induced migration. Social protection gained attention in the international climate negotiations with the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage. Yet, its potential to address migration, considered as a key issue in the loss and damage debate, has not been sufficiently explored. This paper aims at identifying key characteristics of social protection schemes which could effectively address climate-induced migration and attempts to derive recommendations for policy design. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the existing literature, the paper links empirical evidence on the effects of social protection to climate-related drivers of migration and the needs of vulnerable populations. This approach allows conceptually identifying characteristics of effective social protection policies. Findings - Findings indicate that social protection can be part of a proactive approach to managing climate-induced migration both in rural and urban areas. In particular, public work programmes offer solutions to different migration outcomes, from no to permanent migration. Benefits are achieved when programmes explicitly integrate climate change impacts into their design. Social protection can provide temporary support to facilitate migration, in situ adaptation or integration and adaptation in destination areas. It is no substitution for but can help trigger sustainable adaptation solutions. Originality/value - The paper helps close research gaps regarding the potential roles and channels of social protection for addressing and facilitating climate-induced migration and providing public support in destination, mostly in urban areas.",0.11233220718817366,0.410020096484041,0.10931169800126399,0.4551954101968861,0.11542909540844758,0.22384913136771378,0.08736528185584172

"Linking Coastal Disasters and Migration: A Case Study of Kutubdia Island, Bangladesh","On 4 August 2012, the southeastern part of Kutubdia Island, Bangladesh, experienced coastal erosion and flooding associated with tidal waves, storms, and continuous heavy rainfall for two days. This provided a unique opportunity to study the relationship between rapid-onset disasters and migration decisions of individual households perpetually living under environmental risk. Using Kutubdia Island as a case study, this article examines the migration decisions of respondents in the immediate aftermath of two extreme natural events. Relevant data were primarily collected from a questionnaire survey conducted nearly two months after the occurrence of the event. The study's findings support the view that both environmental and nonenvironmental factors lead to migration.

"Social solidarity, collective identity, resilient communities: Two case studies from the rural U.S. and Uruguay","Worldwide, communities face disruptions driven by phenomena such as climate change and globalization. Socio-ecological resilience theorists have called for greater attention to the social dynamics that inform whether and how communities are reorganized and sustained in response to such challenges. Scholars increasingly stress that social heterogeneities provide resources that communities can mobilize to adapt and sustain themselves in response to disruptions. Utilizing the sociological literature that emphasizes that social solidarities and collective identities are centrally important to community responses to socio-ecological disruptions, we argue that solidarities grounded in collective identities can act as important mediators between social heterogeneity and resilience. Drawing on qualitative data from rural communities in the central United States and southwestern Uruguay, we explore how group solidarity enabled individuals to more effectively draw on their diverse knowledges, skills, and resources to sustain their communities. Linked by a collective identity grounded in rurality, in each setting, individuals effectively worked together to adapt to emerging socio-ecological disruptions. These results suggest that we can better understand how social heterogeneities inform resilience by considering how solidarities grounded in collective identities influence whether and how individuals can successfully cooperate to rearrange and sustain their communities. When working with rural communities, specifically, it will be especially important to account for solidarities and collective identities tied to rurality. © 2018 by the authors.",0.3630879606781502,0.4613982871884012,0.11802015043995764,0.48470507147702485,0.06107153574668754,0.12427128156015983,0.14889308089212233
"Transformations for Resilient Rural Futures: The Case of Kaikura, Aotearoa-New Zealand","On 14 November 2016, a magnitude (M-w) 7.8 earthquake struck the small coastal settlement of Kaikura, Aotearoa-New Zealand. With an economy based on tourism, agriculture, and fishing, Kaikura was immediately faced with significant logistical, economic, and social challenges caused by damage to critical infrastructure and lifelines, essential to its main industries. Massive landslips cut off road and rail access, stranding hundreds of tourists, and halting the collection, processing and distribution of agricultural products. At the coast, the seabed rose two metres, limiting harbour-access to high tide, with implications for whale watching tours and commercial fisheries. Throughout the region there was significant damage to homes, businesses, and farmland, leaving owners and residents facing an uncertain future. This paper uses qualitative case study analysis to explore post-quake transformations in a rural context. The aim is to gain insight into the distinctive dynamics of disaster response mechanisms, focusing on two initiatives that have emerged in direct response to the disaster. The first examines the ways in which agriculture, food harvesting, production and distribution are being reimagined with the potential to enhance regional food security. The second examines the rescaling of power in decision-making processes following the disaster, specifically examining the ways in which rural actors are leveraging networks to meet their needs and the consequences of that repositioning on rural (and national) governance arrangements. In these and other ways, the local economy is being revitalised, and regional resilience enhanced through diversification, capitalising not on the disaster but the region's natural, social, and cultural capital. Drawing on insights and experience of local stakeholders, policy- and decision-makers, and community representatives we highlight the diverse ways in which these endeavours are an attempt to create something new, revealing also the barriers which needed to be overcome to reshape local livelihoods. Results reveal that the process of transformation as part of rural recovery must be grounded in the lived reality of local residents and their understanding of place, incorporating and building on regional social, environmental, and economic characteristics. In this, the need to respond rapidly to realise opportunities must be balanced with the community-centric approach, with greater recognition given to the contested nature of the decisions to be made. Insights from the case examples can inform preparedness and recovery planning elsewhere, and provide a rich, real-time example of the ways in which disasters can create opportunities for reimagining resilient futures.",0.16147036515287883,0.4809843141400921,0.12415740659558193,0.44357239559016576,0.2945519671840248,0.17495842582972732,0.16416390009630716
Climate-adaptive community water management for food security: Experiences from the UNDP community water initiative,"Facing the double menace of climate change and water crisis, poor communities are now encountering ever more severe challenges in ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Hence, communities have to manage these challenges by adopting a comprehensive approach that not only enhances water resource management, but also adapts agricultural activities to climate variability. Implemented by the Global Environment Facility's Small Grants Programme, the Community Water Initiative (CWI) has adopted a distinctive approach to support demand-driven, innovative, low cost and community-based water resource management for food security. Experiences from CWI show that a comprehensive, locally adapted approach that integrates water resources management, poverty reduction, climate adaptation and community empowerment provides a good model for sustainable development in poor rural areas.",0.7147105177172366,0.2658373158709645,0.14417514116762328,0.372009282284651,0.06760738349600698,0.06022031347070691,0.5773849774284573
Voluntary relocation as an adaptation strategy to extreme weather events,"Migration out of hazard-prone areas presents significant opportunities for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Alongside and intermingled with opportunistic migration there has always been relocation to escape, particularly from calamity, disaster and warfare. As climate change is considered a likely driver of migration, the literature encompasses a debate as to whether or not migration can be considered to be adaptation. This paper investigates the concept of voluntary within-country migration as an adaptation strategy to reduce disaster risk in Australia. We refer to this internal migration as relocation. The paper examines results of research carried out in Australia at the time of recent and extensive disasters, where opportunities were presented to examine household attitudes towards relocation in the face of future disasters of similar extent. Individuals' attitudes towards relocation were ascertained within an adaptation and mitigation context, at a time of emerging longer term climate change government policy that advocates retreat from hazard prone locations. The paper examines demographic data to reveal who is likely to leave or stay. Policy implications of relocation strategies as climate change adaptation strategy within a developed nation are discussed. This research concludes that relocation is a strategy available to some as part of an extensive range of responses to extreme weather events but undertaking unsupported resettlement is not always an option for reasons of family commitment, livelihood opportunities, financial constraints and emotional lies. Those who remain, and those who leave a hazard prone location may both demonstrate a capacity for adaptation and resilience. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate change-induced heat risks for migrant populations working at brick kilns in India: a transdisciplinary approach,"During the summer of 2015, India was hit by a scorching heat wave that melted pavements in Delhi and caused thousands of deaths, mainly among the most marginalized populations. One such group facing growing heat risks from both occupational and meteorological causes are migrant brick kiln workers. This study evaluates both current heat risks and the potential future impacts of heat caused by climate change, for the people working at brick kilns in India. A case study of heat stress faced by people working at brick kilns near Chennai, India, is the anchor point around which a transdisciplinary approach was applied. Around Chennai, the situation is alarming since occupational heat exposure in the hot season from March to July is already at the upper limits of what humans can tolerate before risking serious impairment. The aim of the study was to identify new pathways for change and soft solutions by both reframing the problem and expanding the solution space being considered in order to improve the quality of life for the migrant populations at the brick kilns. Technical solutions evaluated include the use of sun-dried mud bricks and other locally ""appropriate technologies"" that could mitigate the worsening of climate change-induced heat. Socio-cultural solutions discussed for empowering the people who work at the brick kilns include participatory approaches such as open re-localization, and rights-based approaches including the environmental sustainability and the human rights-based approach framework. Our analysis suggests that an integrative, transdisciplinary approach could incorporate a more holistic range of technical and socio-culturally informed solutions in order to protect the health of people threatened by India's brick kiln industry.",0.2609435053630447,0.46295724484968537,0.08621952374114582,0.23758125686221018,0.05252049010028922,0.11398063404184094,0.02857811355180055
Health-risk perception and its mediating effect on protective behavioral adaptation to heat waves,"Ensuring spontaneously adjusting behaviors of the public in their daily life in response to heat waves is an important aspect of successful public health intervention under climate change. However, the current response behavior guidance released by the government is insufficient because of the limited understanding of public perceptions of heat-related risk and the motivating factors for the public's diverse adaptive behaviors. Here, we conducted a survey on the behavioral adaptations of 3065 urban residents in response to heat waves in Jinan, which is a typical city suffering from a hot climate. We provided evidence on the current state of residents' perception of heat waves and the mechanism of how risk perception mediates individual behavioral intentions upon exposure to high ambient temperatures. We found that the mediating effects of risk perception varied significantly with respect to different types of adaptive behaviors. Concern behaviors appeared be motivated completely by the mediating effects of perceived concern (b = 0.45, p < 0.01 for concerns about health guidelines; b = 0.36, p < 0.01 for concerns about the weather forecast) and severity (b = 0.11, p < 0.01 for concerns about health guidelines), while outdoor activity could be consciously adjusted according to temperature changes without those mediating effects (p > 0.05). Indoor cooling behaviors and transportation behaviors are partially mediated by risk perception (b = -0.04, p < 0.01; b = 0.08, p < 0.01; b = 0.08, p < 0.01 for indoor fan usage, use of air-conditioned buses, and use of private cars, respectively). The conclusions could help determine more targeted and detailed interventions to enhance public behavioral adjustments, including participation in adaption to and emergency preparedness for extreme temperature under the ongoing climate changes.",0.17208538269238646,0.4443759955228996,0.10406266395957199,0.22546488072351129,0.01870396503648646,0.2441418784498281,0.04032936560364459
Socio-Economic Impact of and Adaptation to Extreme Heat and Cold of Farmers in the Food Bowl of Nepal,"Farmers worldwide have to deal with increasing climate variability and weather extremes. Most of the previous research has focused on impacts on agricultural production, but little is known about the related social and economic impacts on farmers. In this study, we investigated the social and economic impact of extreme weather events (EWE) on farmers in Nepal, and explored how they coped with and adapted to heat waves and cold spells between 2012 and 2017. To address these aims, we conducted a survey of 350 farms randomly selected from the Bardiya and Banke districts of the Terai lowlands of Nepal. They were specifically asked to rate the impacts of extreme temperatures, as well as their effect on labour productivity and collective farmer health, and the detailed preventative measures they had implemented. About 84% of the farmers self-reported moderate or severe heat stress during the last five years, and about 85%, moderate or severe cold stress. Likewise, the majority of respondents reported that both farmer health and labour productivity had been compromised by EWEs. Productivity loss had a strong association with the perceived levels of heat and cold stress, which, in turn, were more likely to be reported by farmers with previous EWE experience. Potentially due to the increased care required during EWEs, those farmers with livestock reported increased heat and cold stress, as, surprisingly, did those who had implemented adaptation measures. Farmers seemed to be less prepared for potential threats of cold spells than heat waves, and therefore less likely to adopt coping strategies, since these are a recent phenomenon. This study identified some limitations. The cross sectional and self-reported data, as a common source of information to estimate health impact, level of heat/cold stress and labour productivity loss. Community-based education/community engagement programs could be developed to facilitate proactive adaptation.",0.7341697620973732,0.36130990359432386,0.06364068899212787,0.3508603688136645,0.02043412495772056,0.04673573689598651,0.02350207593920496
National-level progress on adaptation,"It is increasingly evident that adaptation will figure prominently in the post-2015 United Nations climate change agreement(1,2). As adaptation obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change evolve, more rigorous approaches to measuring adaptation progress among parties will be critical. In this Letter we elaborate on an emerging area of research referred to as 'adaptation tracking', which has potential to inform development of a global adaptation monitoring framework(3). We evaluate this potential by presenting evidence on policy change for 41 high-income countries between 2010 and 2014. We examine whether countries that were in early stages of adaptation planning in 2010 are making progress to close adaptation gaps, and how the landscape of adaptation in these countries has evolved. In total we find an 87% increase in reported adaptation policies and measures, and evidence that implementation of concrete adaptation initiatives is growing. Reflecting on the strengths and challenges of this early methodology, we further discuss how adaptation tracking practices could guide development of a robust framework for monitoring global adaptation progress and inform future research on policy change across countries.",0.28088267892834895,0.39135124268201826,0.21441793646325866,0.27818340128856034,0.163121327620921,0.22921293877292204,0.054593015891708264

Intergovernmental relations for public health adaptation to climate change in the federalist states of Canada and Germany,"Climate change is a significant threat to public health, and governments at all scales will need to adapt to protect the health of their populations. The impacts of climate change are highly localized and thus federal systems theoretically have the inherent advantage of allowing for regional diversity and policy experimentation in adaptation. However, there are also higher levels of conflict and stalemates in federal systems than in unitary systems, complicating intergovernmental relations and coordination necessary for public health adaptation. We examine how intergovernmental dynamics are patterned across national, regional and local levels of government for public health adaptation to climate change, drawing upon semi-structured interviews (n = 28) in comparative embedded case studies of Canada and Germany. We find that coordination between levels of government specifically for climate change and health is rare, but climate change issues are occasionally discussed through working groups or through existing methods of public health coordination. These findings have implications for national and regional governments in federal systems seeking to enable sub-national public health adaptation to climate change and create synergies between levels of government.",0.11609890180999702,0.5,0.13169503655592213,0.24408224553179267,0.055307631586060446,0.25649145637814214,0.036194991358109156
Climate change and occupational heat stress risks and adaptation strategies of mining workers: Perspectives of supervisors and other stakeholders in Ghana,"Increasing air temperatures as a result of climate change are worsening the impact of heat exposure on working populations, including mining workers, who are at risk of suffering heat-related illnesses, injury and death. However, inadequate awareness of climate change-related occupational heat stress risks and adaptation strategies have been shown to render occupational heat stress management ineffective. A concurrent mixed-methods approach was used to assess the perceptions of climate change and occupational heat stress risks and adaptation strategies of mining workers among supervisory personnel and other stakeholders in Ghana. Questionnaires and interviews were used to elicit data from 19 respondents. Data were processed and interpreted using descriptive statistics, chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, and thematic analysis. Supervisors' climate change risks perception was adequate, and their concern about workplace heat exposure risks was moderate. Mining workers' occupational heat stress risks experiences were linked to heat-related illness and minor injuries. Mining workers' adaptation strategies included water intake, use of cooling mechanisms, work-break practices, and clothing use. The related differences in job experience in the distribution of climate change risk perception and occupational heat stress risk experiences, and the difference in educational attainment in the distribution of adaptation strategies of occupational heat stress were significant (p < 0.05). Hence, an effective workplace heat management policy requires adequate understanding of occupational heat stress risks and adaptation policies and continued education and training for mining workers.",0.4317132921793769,0.4427747582737249,0.05588096802779233,0.23834513410154579,0.02856799550031565,0.11149323570585619,0.02042681798333819
Drivers and temporality of internal migration in the context of slow-onset natural hazards: Insights from north-west rural Bangladesh,"This paper examines the association between slow-onset natural hazards and the temporal aspects of human mobility-that is, short-term and long-term internal migration in the context of north-west Bangladesh. The paper contributes to the current understanding on the multiple stressors influencing individual's decisions to migrate from their rural origin, while examining the interplay between factors such as tipping points of migration (identified as drivers of migration), socio-demographic variables, and the contexts of slow-onset natural hazards. The analysis is based on empirical data relating to disadvantaged internal migrants or their household members living in drought-prone and riverine areas. A binary logistic regression model is used to analyse how various factors influence the temporality of migration. Key findings indicate that in the context of the natural hazards studied, financial stress at the household level and lack of economic resources are strongly associated with people's decisions to migrate for the-long or short-term. Based on such findings, the paper argues for diversified policy interventions for different groups of internal migrants in order to address difficulties associated with their mobility to and settlement at new locations.",0.313648718495395,0.3845981130438512,0.05671904411058635,0.5944250464835832,0.11469303426849335,0.07178999134815084,0.16666384108292073
Development and Validation of a Behavioural Index for Adaptation to High Summer Temperatures among Urban Dwellers,"One of the consequences of climate change is the growing number of extreme weather events, including heat waves, which have substantial impacts on the health of populations. From a public health standpoint, it is vital to ensure that people can adapt to high heat, particularly in cities where heat islands abound. Identifying indicators to include in a parsimonious index would help better differentiate individuals who adapt well to heat from those who do not adapt as well. This study aimed at developing and validating a summer heat adaptation index for residents of the 10 largest cities in the province of Quebec, Canada. A sample of 2000 adults in 2015 and 1030 adults in 2016 completed a telephone questionnaire addressing their adoption (or non-adoption) of behaviours recommended by public health agencies to protect themselves during periods of high temperature, and their perceptions of how high summer heat affects their mental and physical health. Item analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, multiple correspondence analysis, measurement invariance analyses and criterion-validity analyses were used to develop a 12-behaviour heat adaptation index for distinguishing between individuals who adapt well to high temperatures and those who do not adapt as well. The results indicated that the measurement and the factor structure of the index were invariant (equivalent) across the two independent samples of participants who completed the questionnaire at different times one year apart, an important prerequisite for unambiguous interpretation of index scores across groups and over time. The results also showed that individuals who perceived more adverse effects on their physical or mental health adopted more preventive behaviours during periods of high temperatures and humidity conditions compared to those who felt lesser or no effects. This study thus presents support for the validity of the index that could be used in future studies to monitor preventive behaviours adoption during summer periods of high temperature.",0.17131852809242354,0.5336031764472655,0.05018576418936131,0.17962043366999,0.02890445246779806,0.29271734709783936,0.02703352611122819
Changes in winter conditions impact forest management in north temperate forests,"Climate change may impact forest management activities with important implications for forest ecosystems. However, most climate change research on forests has focused on climate-driven shifts in species ranges, forest carbon, and hydrology. To examine how climate change may alter timber harvesting and forest operations in north temperate forests, we asked: 1) How have winter conditions changed over the past 60 years? 2) Have changes in winter weather altered timber harvest patterns on public forestlands? 3) What are the implications of changes in winter weather conditions for timber harvest operations in the context of the economic, ecological, and social goals of forest management? Using meteorological information from Climate Data Online and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models we document substantial changes in winter conditions in Wisconsin, including a two- to three-week shortening of frozen ground conditions from 1948 to 2012. Increases in minimum and mean soil temperatures were spatially heterogeneous. Analysis of timber harvest records identified a shift toward greater harvest of jack pine and red pine and less harvest of aspen, black spruce, hemlock, red maple, and white spruce in years with less frozen ground or snow duration. Interviews suggested that frozen ground is a mediating condition that enables low-impact timber harvesting. Climate change may alter frozen ground conditions with complex implications for forest management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Adaptive Capacity of the Monterey Bay Wetfish Fisheries: Proactive Responses to the 2015-16 El Nino Event,"Natural resource sustainability depends on adaptive capacity: the latent ability of a social-ecological system to rely on or implement effective strategies to cope with disturbances. We propose and implement a new three-step framework for studying a social-ecological system's adaptive capacity that consists of assessment, strategy identification, and activation. We apply this framework to analyze the adaptive capacity of the Monterey Bay wetfish fisheries community in response to a significant stressor in the system: El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We conducted 49 semi-structured interviews with participants engaged in these fisheries and/or providing ENSO information. Of the 67 social-ecological strategies identified through a literature review, we found 42 contribute to high adaptive capacity to ENSO. The most influential strategies were matching formal and informal rules to system dynamics, diversifying livelihoods, enhancing economic safety nets, social learning, and accessing early warning systems. Our findings suggest approaches for enhancing adaptive capacity in other resource systems.",0.5900995772717578,0.4098390737337235,0.26202012696498617,0.39975573982320445,0.11876453354669818,0.049220189376887366,0.10150932384929612
"""I know, therefore I adapt?"" Complexities of individual adaptation to climate-induced forest dieback in Alaska","Individual actions to avoid, benefit from, or cope with climate change impacts partly shape adaptation; much research on adaptation has focused at the systems level, overlooking drivers of individual responses. Theoretical frameworks and empirical studies of environmental behavior identify a complex web of cognitive, affective, and evaluative factors that motivate stewardship. We explore the relationship between knowledge of, and adaptation to, widespread, climate-induced tree mortality to understand the cognitive (i.e., knowledge and learning), affective (i.e., attitudes and place attachment), and evaluative (i.e., use values) factors that influence how individuals respond to climate-change impacts. From 43 semistructured interviews with forest managers and users in a temperate forest, we identified distinct responses to local, climate-induced environmental changes that we then categorized as either behavioral or psychological adaptations. Interviewees developed a depth of knowledge about the dieback through a combination of direct, place-based experiences and indirect, mediated learning through social interactions. Knowing that the dieback was associated with climate change led to different adaptive responses among the interviewees, although knowledge alone did not explain this variation. Forest users reported psychological adaptations to process negative attitudes; these adaptations were spurred by knowledge of the causes, losses of intangible values, and impacts to a species to which they held attachment. Behavioral adaptations exclusive to a high level of knowledge included actions such as using the forests to educate others or changing transportation behaviors to reduce personal energy consumption. Managers integrated awareness of the dieback and its dynamics across spatial scales into current management objectives. Our findings suggest that adaptive management may occur from the bottom up, as individual managers implement new practices in advance of policies. As knowledge of climate-change impacts in local environments increases, resource users may benefit from programs and educational interventions that facilitate coping strategies.",0.29572578713173026,0.40247349632716206,0.29987228727140475,0.2523416388382648,0.1329553543703035,0.08155788419235088,0.1387939151297846
Urban flooding and ground-related homes in Canada: an overview,"Urban flooding associated with extreme precipitation is a significant cause of disaster damages for municipalities, homeowners and insurers in Canada. Several approaches have been applied to reduce urban flood risk at the municipal and homeowner scales, including addressing inflow/infiltration in wastewater systems, accommodating extreme stormwater flows in subdivision design and protecting individual homes from flooding. Insurers have also engaged in managing urban flood risk through interactions with individual policyholders and initiatives aimed at better understanding urban flood risk and risk mitigation options. Requiring mitigation measures at the time of the construction of homes, improving insurance data, application of incentives for appropriate private side retrofits, and improved collaboration between insurers and municipalities for identification of urban flood risk areas provide additional opportunities for urban flood risk reduction. Further, senior levels of governments should support inflow/infiltration reduction and application of climate change information to improve the planning and design of municipal infrastructure.",0.036056081903618364,0.32801279933849775,0.1080047424349491,0.12754845160999467,0.08516823428807044,0.9162805691410716,0.5866756821839416
Survey Results of Green Infrastructure Implementation in New Jersey,"An online survey was undertaken to document the extent of green infrastructure (GI) installations throughout New Jersey at the municipal level and to determine the barriers to implementation of these techniques for the state's municipalities. An in-depth online survey was sent to various officials in each of the state's municipalities. Responses were received from 147 (26%) of New Jersey's 565 municipalities. Of the respondents, 108 (74%) already had at least one GI practice installed in their town, with rain gardens being the most popular practice with installations in 91 municipalities (62%). Reducing stormwater runoff was the most common primary motivating factor for GI installations with 19 affirmative responses (13%), while climate change adaptation was not chosen by any respondents. Funding was stated as the primary barrier to GI installation, but many municipalities had not applied for grants to defray costs. Despite the lack of state incentives and inconsistent municipal conformance with components of the state stormwater rules, the movement to manage stormwater through the use of GI techniques appears to be steadily moving forward in New Jersey.

Development and validation of five behavioral indices of flood adaptation,"Background: In the current context of climate change, climate forecasts for the province of Quebec (Canada) are a lengthening of the thunderstorm season and an increase in episodes of intense precipitations. These changes in the distribution of precipitations could heighten the intensity or frequency of floods, a natural hazard that concerns 80% of Quebec's riverside municipalities. For the health and safety of the at-risk population, it is very important to make sure they have acquired necessary adaptive behaviors against flooding hazard. However, there has been no assessment of these flood adaptation behaviors to date. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop and validate five indices of adaptation to flooding. Methods: A sample of 1951 adults completed a questionnaire by phone. The questionnaire, specifically developed for this study, measured whether they did or did not adopt the behaviors that are proposed by public health officials to protect themselves against flooding. Results: The results of the item, confirmatory factor, and multiple correspondence analyses contributed to the development of five indices corresponding to the adaptation behaviors to adopt according to the chronology of events: (a) pre-alert preventive behaviors, (b) behaviors to carry out after the alert is issued, (c) behaviors to adopt during a flood not requiring evacuation, (d) behaviors to adopt during a flood requiring evacuation, and (e) post-flood behaviors. The results of this study also showed that people who perceive a risk of flooding in their home in the next 5 years tend to adopt more preventive behaviors and adaptation behaviors than those who perceive little or no risk at all. They also reveal that people who feel more adverse effects on their physical or mental health tend to adopt more adaptive behaviors than those who feel little or no adverse effects on their health. Conclusion: Across a series of psychometric analyses, the results showed that these flood adaptation indices could properly measure a vast range of adaptive behaviors according to the chronology of events. Therefore, researchers, public health agencies, and professionals can use them to monitor the evolution of individuals' adaptive behaviors during floods.",0.12567367401751875,0.4388978631363979,0.09678182092572993,0.25650647696773526,0.04489983185378667,0.21911721541821116,0.22963674275454227
Hydroclimate Variability in Snow-Fed River Systems: Local Water Managers' Perspectives on Adapting to the New Normal,"Between water years 2012 and 2017, the Truckee-Carson river system in the western United States experienced both historic-low and record-high Sierra Nevada snowpack, anomalously warm temperatures, and winter and spring flooding. As part of an ongoing collaborative modeling research program in the river system, researchers conduct annual interviews with key local water managers to characterize local climate adaptation strategies and implementation barriers, and identify science information needs to prioritize ongoing research activities. This article presents new findings from a third wave of interviews conducted with the same water managers following the historic 2017 wet year. Comparison of these data suggests that managers increased their adaptation efforts described during previous consecutive drought years (2015 and 2016). In 2017, comparatively fewer managers described climate uncertainty as an implementation barrier, exemplifying recent hydroclimate variability as the ""new normal"" climate for which they should plan. An assessment of recent conditions reveals that recent water years bound historical observations and are consistent with estimated paleoclimate extremes in terms of magnitude, but not persistence, of both dry and wet conditions. Comparison to projected future climate conditions affirms managers' perspectives that increased hydroclimate variability, inclusive of drought and flood extremes, defines the new normal climate anticipated for the region. To support long-term adaptation planning, managers requested that researchers prioritize simulations of alternative water management strategies that account for nonstationary climate patterns and quantify implications system-wide. This article illustrates how interdisciplinary research that integrates local knowledge with applied climate science research can support adaptive water management in snow-fed river systems.",0.452608475376483,0.2899530508140354,0.21863811552153836,0.2158301074366805,0.06146406262913945,0.1420921422394981,0.8109989253974053
Vulnerability of specialty crops to short-term climatic variability and adaptation strategies in the Midwestern USA,"While the Midwestern USA ranks among the world's most important corn-soybean production regions, the area also produces a variety of high-value specialty crops. These crops are an important component of the region's rural economy with an estimated value of $1.8 billion in 2012. More profitable per-acre than many row crops, specialty crops also have higher production-related risks. They are generally more sensitive to climatic stressors and require more comprehensive management compared to traditional row crops. Temperature and precipitation fluctuations across the Midwest directly impact specialty crop production quantity and quality and indirectly influence the timing of crucial farm operations and the economic impacts of pests, weeds, and diseases. Increasingly variable weather and climate change pose a serious threat to specialty crop production in the Midwest. In this article, we assess how climate variability and observed climatic trends are impacting Midwestern specialty crop production using USDA Risk Management Agency data. In addition, we review current trends in grower perceptions of risks associated with a changing climate and assess sustainable adaptation strategies. Our results indicate that weather-induced losses vary by state with excessive moisture resulting in the highest total number of claims across all Midwestern states followed by freeze and drought events. Overall, specialty crop growers are aware of the increased production risk under a changing climate and have identified the need for crop-specific weather, production, and financial risk management tools and increased crop insurance coverage.",0.9427829954899345,0.21218894914606368,0.09608449553721501,0.4765136789419374,0.012465877468551967,0.0268674596205616,0.026104503848794286
"A Survey-Based Assessment of Cattle Producers' Adaptation to Climate Change in British Columbia, Canada","A quantitative analysis of the British Columbia, Canada cattle ranching community in light of global climate change provides insight as to how stakeholder needs and observations can be included in future planning. More than 63% of the 239 survey respondents believe that human activities are increasing the rate at which global climate changes occur, and 60% of 231 respondents adapted their management because of climate change. Cattle ranchers operating for less than 20 years were more likely to agree that human activities are increasing the rate of global climate change compared with those operating more than 40 years. This may reflect the fact that the concept of climate change has gained more public acceptance in the past 2 decades and would likely be perceived as a legitimate risk to an operation by those in this category in comparison with those who have been operating for a long period of time and tend to rely on experiential or embedded knowledge. Regional analysis showed that the most northerly region is more likely to have noticed change in climate compared with one of the most southern regions. With respect to operation of scale in terms of head of cattle, those ranches with more than 50 head of cattle identified water availability as a significant challenge to operations. Family succession planning was identified as a greater challenge for those operating their ranch for more than 40 years, compared with those operating less than 20 years. Adaptation to climate change included accessing available forage and providing a water source for cattle. Experiential and scientific knowledge will be crucial to future planning to reduce the vulnerability of the ranching industry and building adaptive capacity. (C) 2015 Society for Range Management.

"Developing and Implementing Climate Change Adaptation Options in Forest Ecosystems: A Case Study in Southwestern Oregon, USA","Climate change will likely have significant effects on forest ecosystems worldwide. In Mediterranean regions, such as that in southwestern Oregon, USA, changes will likely be driven mainly by wildfire and drought. To minimize the negative effects of climate change, resource managers require tools and information to assess climate change vulnerabilities and to develop and implement adaptation actions. We developed an approach to facilitate development and implementation of climate change adaptation options in forest management. This approach, applied in a southwestern Oregon study region, involved establishment of a science-manager partnership, a science-based assessment of forest and woodland vulnerabilities to climate change, climate change education in multiple formats, hands-on development of adaptation options, and application of tools to incorporate climate change in planned projects. Through this approach, we improved local manager understanding of the potential effects of climate change in southwestern Oregon, and enabled evaluation of proposed management activities in the context of climatic stressors. Engaging managers throughout the project increased ownership of the process and outcomes, as well as the applicability of the adaptation options toe-ground actions.

Climate action co-benefits and integrated community planning: Uncovering the synergies and trade-offs,"Engaging in climate action through integrated sustainability strategies can yield benefits for communities in more effective ways than through compartmentalized approaches. Such strategies can result in co-benefits, that is, community benefits that occur from acting on climate change that extend beyond mitigation and adaptation. For example, creating more walkable cities can be a strategy for reducing greenhouse gases, but can also lead to healthier communities. Climate strategies with co-benefits can result in ""win-win"" situations and thus improve practices for integrated community planning. However, this planning approach also presents challenges because it requires understanding complex relationships between community development practices and identifying synergies. In addition, some co-benefit strategies may also have associated challenges and trade-offs. This research examines climate action cobenefits and trade-offs in order to develop a comprehensive picture of the relationships and potential effects of implementing certain plans and strategies. The research consisted of collecting data on climate action efforts occurring in eleven BC (Canada) communities and coding it to identify climate strategies, co-benefits, challenges, and trade-offs. Relationships between codes were then identified through a coding matrix, and these were used to build a series of models that illustrate co-benefits, challenges, and trade-offs associated with local climate action. Each model centered on a particular area of climate action, including energy innovation, urban densification, mixed-use and downtown revitalization, building stock, ecological capital, trails and transportation, and waste and water. The models provide a holistic impression of the advantages and disadvantages associated with different plans and strategies, which in turn can guide both quantitative analyses and qualitative explorations that contribute toward integrated community planning and decision-making. © Common Ground Research Networks, Robert Newell, Ann Dale, Mark Roseland.",0.3003243784816284,0.3508269417839394,0.11215368289201749,0.3035419758002463,0.07680457596179027,0.2586791211058529,0.09818872645747295
Extreme Heat Awareness and Protective Behaviors in New York City,"Heat waves can be lethal and routinely prompt public warnings about the dangers of heat. With climate change, extreme heat events will become more frequent and intense. However, little is known about public awareness of heat warnings or behaviors during hot weather. Awareness of heat warnings, prevention behaviors, and air conditioning (AC) prevalence and use in New York City were assessed using quantitative and qualitative methods. A random sample telephone survey was conducted in September 2011 among 719 adults and follow-up focus groups were held in winter 2012 among seniors and potential senior caregivers. During summer 2011, 79 % of adults heard or saw a heat warning. Of the 24 % who were seniors or in fair or poor health, 34 % did not own AC or never/rarely used it on hot days. Of this subgroup, 30 % were unaware of warnings, and 49 % stay home during hot weather. Reasons for not using AC during hot weather include disliking AC (29 %), not feeling hot (19 %), and a preference for fans (18 %). Seniors in the focus groups did not perceive themselves to be at risk, and often did not identify AC as an important health protection strategy. While heat warnings are received by most New Yorkers, AC cost, risk perception problems, and a preference for staying home leave many at risk during heat waves. Improving AC access and risk communications will help better protect the most vulnerable during heat waves.",0.11880644358181142,0.4762476390597491,0.04473618855364411,0.11588787886565165,0.022963504447054764,0.33561949185179196,0.04706128529626825
"Coastal climate adaptation in port-cities: adaptation deficits, barriers, and challenges ahead","Port cities are on the frontline of emerging coastal risks related to climate change, sea-level rise, and human impacts on coastal zones. This article addresses the need for adaptation in port cities. It reviews key meanings of coastal climate adaptation, and its inherent complexity and uncertainties. It then provides an overview of the current status of coastal climate adaptation, discusses ‘adaptation deficits’ in port cities, and describes barriers to adaptation. Subsequently, it highlights the need for adaptive (coastal) planning and management in the face of changing and uncertain future conditions. Finally, it points out research needs and challenges regarding adaptation in port cities, namely the need for localized risk assessments, the need to reduce adaptation deficits, the need to mainstream adaptation into spatial planning, the need for advanced studies on adaptation measures, the need for integrated efforts, the need for adaptive planning approaches for dealing with changing risks over time, under uncertainty in highly dynamic environments. © 2019, © 2019 Newcastle University.",0.06765771305384267,0.4344582943785816,0.10704743392900293,0.20122493684481443,0.4882453578206234,0.6670593440476289,0.1415539958589882
"Coastal adaptation, government-subsidized insurance, and perverse incentives to stay","The law should be a critical tool in promoting and directing climate change adaptation in the USA. This should be particularly true in the nation's extensive coastal zone, much of which is subject to increasing rates of sea level rise, coastal erosion, increasing numbers of increasingly powerful storms, and saltwater intrusion. However, significant coastal infrastructure hampers many coastal adaptation strategies by making retreat both expensive and politically unpalatable. This article examines the specific role of insurance and other financing programs in coastal adaptation strategies. Insurance operates primarily to mitigate risk. The article focuses specifically on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is now driven by coastal catastrophes and is close to bankruptcy; Florida's decision to provide state-financed insurance to coastal property owners in the wake of the 2004-2005 hurricane season; and, conversely, the decisions of other states to use state and federal financing instead to facilitate coastal adaptation, including buyouts of transitioning coastal properties.",0.13819528447742602,0.42518660524111546,0.08481488774543966,0.21720511555025498,0.8064122997332293,0.7300510298166258,0.212839496060698
"Opportunities and barriers for urban adaptation to climate change in Latin America. Cases of Mexico City, Lima and Santiago de Chile","This paper analyzes opportunities and barriers for urban adaptation to climate change. A framework aiming at influencing decision-making was developed. Whether urban planners take action depends on three first-tier variables: information, resources, and incentives. These variables are themselves functions of underlying variables, including actor-specific characteristics of the decision-maker, the institutional environment, and the natural and socio-economic environment. The framework is applied in three case studies for Mexico City, Lima and Santiago, Chile, where anecdotal evidence has been gathered from expert interviews. The obtained results indicate that the relevant categories of barriers are mainly the same across the case studies.

Adaptation to drought in the Algerian steppe: The case of productive strategies of Hadj Mechri agro-pastoralists,"Inter-annual variability, which characterizes the climate of Northern Algeria, is accentuated by climate change. In the steppe, where agro-pastoral activities are strongly dependent on rainfall, the increase of rainfall variability augments the vulnerability of agro-pastoralists, particularly those weakly endowed with resources, and compromises reproduction of their farming systems. Faced with this situation, these agro-pastoralists develop different adaptation strategies. A study of crop-livestock production systems in two localities in the Wilaya of Laghouat, conducted between 2008 and 2010, found that those who remain on rangelands after droughts mobilize resources from business partners during wet years through different types of agrarian contracts. These contracts concern the keeping of livestock or partnerships in livestock and cereal production.",0.9118578354575081,0.245432893565549,0.10004764430244259,0.5418486706579521,0.03119376406808234,0.01521416508298632,0.026167201651491924
Rural household perceptions and adaptations to climate change based on an investigation and comparison of two middle and eastern villages in China,"The negative impact of climate change on rural householders is more direct and stronger than the effect on their counterparts in urban area, and their perception of climate change is an important prerequisite for adaptation strategies. There have been many related research studies on this subject, but very few have undertaken a typical household investigation. Furthermore, a micro empirical study based on a comparative study of rural households in different areas has not been reported. Two villages in a typical agricultural area in the inland central area of Henan Province and the eastern coastal area of Fujian Province were selected. The participatory rural appraisal (PRA) method was used, and 144 and 153 valid questionnaires were completed by central and eastern households, respectively. The structural differences in the perception of climate change and its impact, and their livelihood adaptations, are explored from the perspective of the household. The results showed that farmer perceptions of temperature and precipitation variation were direct and robust, and they had similarly strong views on the strength and the period of climate warming. However, inland farmers' perceptions were more sensitive to precipitation to some extent, and nearly half of the households attributed warming to human factors. The perceptions of human activities, such as industrial emissions, car increases, personal and family consumption, agricultural pollution, and rural construction, etc., were significantly different between inland and coastal villages. Overall, household perceptions were lower than expected; and the livelihood adaptation strategies were diverse. These included becoming migrant workers, changing cropping patterns, constructing infrastructure, and diversifying management, etc. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

Simultaneous modelling of the perception of and adaptation to climate change: The case of the maize producers in northern Benin,"In Benin, as in most developing countries, farmers are experiencing the need to adapt their farming systems to climate change, developing strategies to sustain their livelihoods. This paper aims at analysing the maize producers' adaptation to climate change. Accordingly, the farmers' perception of and adaptation to climate change were identified in order to analyse the underlining determinants. The study was conducted in the municipal areas of Malanville, Banikoara, Bembereke, and Natitingou, in northern Benin. A total of 336 farmers producing maize were randomly sampled and were then interviewed. Generally, maize producers in Northern Benin perceive climate change and adapt to it, primarily, through crop diversification and adjustment of cropping practices and agricultural calendar. A Heckman Probit model highlights that experience in agriculture and organisation membership were positively correlated with both perception of and adaptation to climate change. In addition, running a side activity, accessing credit, and having contact with agricultural extension services had positive effects on the farmers' decision to adapt to climate change.

Results indicated that among the six zones, Southern zone was highly vulnerable to climate change. The climate change impact in the study region was mostly related to increased water stress. Among different coping strategies, majority of the respondents (54.44%) were found to adopt drought tolerant/resistantcrop varieties that could withstand water stress meanwhile maintaining crop productivity. Another major strategy adopted to cope with the increased water stress was growing of alternative crops. It could be concluded that appropriate crop improvement strategies and relevant crop insurance policies could protect the interest of the farmers in vulnerable regions growing crops.",0.9300365115239707,0.18699836800823924,0.06303519429605267,0.5205083799540302,0.020237956142213378,0.03004491236418225,0.07343336854735054
Effect of governmental regulation on farmers' response behavior of drought resistance: An empirical study of North China Plain,"Agricultural production will be confronted with more serious challenges under climate change. Understanding households' adaptive behaviors and the influence of government policies on them is the fundamental step to improve relevant policies for enhancing farmers' ability of adaptation against drought. The econometrics method is used in this study to evaluate the farmers' adaptive behaviors and their influencing factors, especially the regulation of government policies, like early-warning and policy supports, based on a household and village survey in three provinces of the North China Plain (NCP). The results show that: (1) Most of households are apt to take adaptive measures when facing drought; and the more serious droughts are, the more the adaption measures will be taken. (2) The adaptation behaviors of farmers are affected by the regulation of government policies. The enthusiasm to take adaptations of households can be enhanced obviously by the governments' early-warning information and relevant policy supports, especially when the warning information is released by multiple channels and the subsides or multiple supports are provided by the township government and the village. However, most of the households have no support from governments at all levels. Besides, TV as the present main channel has very little effect on the farmers' hehaviors. (3) Adaptive behaviors vary along with households' characteristics. Farmers who live in irrigated areas, and who have more agricultural members in the family with larger cultivated land block acreage, are more inclined to take adaptive measures. These findings can provide references for the government to take measures to combat drought. © 2017, Science Press.

"An Evaluation of Climate Change Effects on Fishermen and Adaption Strategies in Central Region, Ghana","Government parastatals, nongovernmental organizations and civil societies in Ghana seem to have little access to detailed climate projections and seemingly little understanding of the uncertainties surrounding coastal climate change impacts and adaptations. The study examines climate change effects and adaption strategies of fishermen in the Central Region of Ghana. Through the application of mixed method qualitative and quantitative research, a sample of 116 fishermen were selected through multiphase sampling in three randomly selected administrative assemblies on the coast of the Central Region of Ghana. Respondents were sampled using accidental sampling technique from two randomly selected communities in each assembly. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using structured interview schedule. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics including frequency counts and percentages. The study revealed that erratic rainfall, strong wind/storm with high tides, hot sunshine and high temperatures, drought and flood and heavy precipitation were the main climate effects experienced by the respondents. The negative impacts of climate change experienced by respondents in the fishing business include increasing risk and uncertainty in fishing, fluctuation in fish and wild stock distributions, reduction in the duration of fishing seasons and high fish spoilage and mortality. These effects, the respondents opined, lead to low productivity, reduced income, food insecurity and labour emigration. The respondents have therefore resorted to changing fishing methods, seasonal migrations and livelihoods diversification as responses to the climate change effects. Under-capitalization, limited information, poor marketing systems, lack of research and extension services were the main constraints faced by the fishermen in responding to the climate change effects. More reliable, effective and accessible measures of adaptation are therefore recommended to improve information and knowledge through outreach on various platforms by stakeholders in ensuring sustainable fishing behavior among fishermen. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",0.8478221146566913,0.2674909404307629,0.13482067143456603,0.42805837052117524,0.14877527081420835,0.03463721627384709,0.030419472431974615
The evaluation of famers’ climate change adaptation strategies in high-frigid ecological vulnerable region: A case of Gannan plateau,"Climate change is one of the most serious challenges that the world is facing in the 21st century. Because the farmers depend on the nature resource, they face various negative impacts of climate change, particularly in the high-frigid ecological vulnerable region. Consequently, climate change has strengthened the livelihood vulnerability of these farmers. The farmers themselves have devised various adaptation strategies to deal with climate change. Hence, it is important to determine how effective adaptation strategies are, and to assess their adaptation strategies. The Gannan Plateau was selected as a case study, and through a stratified random sampling survey and participatory rural appraisal, 548 households were investigated. We analyzed the characteristic of the farmer’s climate change adaptation strategies, evaluated the effects of these strategies with a fuzzy integrative evaluate method, and determine the most effective adaptation strategy with a multi- criteria decision-making analysis. The results showed that: (1) Most farmers of the Gannan Plateau combine different strategies for dealing with climate change, with 65.30% of the households being farmers and 30. 21% employing the ‘expansive and accommodating’ strategy. Furthermore, the choice in adaptation strategy of the farmers differed per area, In the ‘pure pasturing area’, the strategy most used was to reduce the livestock, whereas farmers in the ‘semi-farming- pasturing area’, used early pasture transfers, or regulated the timing of the farming season. In addition, famers in the ‘farming area’ also used early pasture transfers, regulated their farming session, or increased irrigation.(2) The overall effect of the adaptation strategies is moderately positive, with an average effect index of 3.43. From this index, the social efficiency index is the highest (3.63), and the economic efficiency is the lowest (3.25). The effect of adaptation strategies was highest in the ‘farming area’ (3.56), less strong in the ‘semi-farming-pasturing area’ (3.37), and worst in the ‘pure pasturing area’ (3.33). (3) The optimal adaptation strategy differed per area, and adjusting the agricultural and animal husbandry structure was the most optimal strategy in the ‘pure pasturing area’ and ‘semi-planting-pasturing area’. For the households of the ‘farming area’, improving agriculture and animal husbandry facilities was the optimal strategy. Finally, we propose some relevant advice to improve the effects of farmers’ adaptation strategies and discuss several issues require further attention in the future. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

Autonomous adaptation to climate change: experiences of rural entrepreneurs in Ecuador,"This work aims to strengthen the capacities of rural communities for autonomous adaptation to climate change, through the socialization of the experiences of Chumunde, Playa de Oro and San Miguel, in the province of Esmeraldas, Ecuador. The informants are 200 people who participated in a dialogue process approached from Social Ethnography, through participatory workshops, interviews and surveys. The Impact Measurement Model of Echavarren and the European Community Climate Adaptation Model are applied. The results allow us to infer that the population of the communities has managed to strengthen their capacities to start autonomous processes of adaptation to climate change through the dynamics of entrepreneurship. The biggest advance is the implementation of processes in the fields of protection of health and material goods. The weaknesses to overcome are linked to the lack of knowledge regarding regulations, and the lack of finances destined for prevention by the local government.",0.35631607794860226,0.4607944588014707,0.10648981890205088,0.3800387378009363,0.07116723608884037,0.09063061170730528,0.23144196948610263
Adaptation of agriculture to global change scenarios. Application of participatory methods in the Jucar River basin (Spain),"This paper develops a participatory methodology to integrate fanner's vision in the design of an adaptation strategy to global change in the Jucar River basin. It aims at answering three questions: How farmers perceive climate change impacts; which adaptation measures they consider, and how they assess these measures. Participatory workshops with different actors were held in two areas (La Ribera and La Mancha Oriental). This methodology has allowed identifying the local impacts and consequences of global change, and the difficulties of the adaptation processes to climate change scenarios.",0.530867772482287,0.36999381070787174,0.1572392972819919,0.3014741350566979,0.07378000179743184,0.11770196885358342,0.15729107940929973
Ecological effects of climate change and livelihood adaptations in typical fishing areas: Perceptions of fishermen’s households,"Climate change has caused direct impacts on the global marine ecological environment, and it has caused tremendous negative impacts on fishery resources, fishery production, and the livelihood of fishermen. Conversely, fishermen’s families also affect the marine ecological environment by adapting their livelihoods to accommodate a climate change scenario. So far, there are few research achievements on the perceptions of livelihood, the livelihood adaptation of fishermen’s to climate change, and ecological effects, and there are few empirical research based on household. This work selects Yacheng, a town of Xiapu County in Fujian, as a study area. This is a typical fishing area located on the southeast coast of China, and the index of the perception of climate change’s impact was built using data from 158 families using the Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) to reveal the inherent connection between the index and livelihood capital. The adjustment of the adaptive strategies of fishermen’s families and the ecological effects of these strategies were further explored. The results showed that: (1) fishermen’s perceptions of climate change and its impacts are relatively strong; (2) the index of the perception of climate change’s impact and the livelihood capital of fishermen are correlated; (3) fishermen have mainly adjusted their livelihood strategies and diversified their incomes; and (4) the adjustment and adaptive strategies of fishermen’s livelihoods cause both positive and negative impacts on the marine ecological environment. Based on these results, we put forth some policy suggestions to provide a useful reference on coping with climate change for local fishing areas, and offer recommendations for protecting the security of fishermen’s livelihood, avoiding the risks of climate change, and protecting the marine ecological environment. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

"The phenomenon of climate change on the perception of Purépecha indigenous community of the municipality of Chilchota, Michoacan, Mexico","The aim of this research was to estimate the perception or knowledge about the phenomenon of climate change in the Purepecha’s indigenous population in the Municipality of Chilchota, Michoacan, Mexico. The latter, taking into account some adaptation mechanisms that the stakeholders may have, based on their current culture, traditions and knowledge. Different surveys were applied as a tool to obtain information. A total of 298 surveys were carried out and distributed in four communities of the municipality: Zopoco (49), Tanaquillo (50), Carapan (59), Ichan (37) and the municipal head Chilchota (103). Multivariate techniques were applied on the surveys to reduce the data structure into groups of variables. Results show that the indigenous population of the Chilchota municipality perceives local changes in the climate attributed to several anthropogenic actions developed in recent years (logging, trash burning, pollution, etc.). They do not associate such changes with the phenomenon of climate change. Agricultural planting schedules in the region have been adjusted as an adaptive measure to the perceived changes. These climate changes are consistent with the average annual temperature and precipitation behavior for the 1968-2007 periods. For this period the temperature showed an increase of 0.5 °C, meanwhile precipitation was reduced to 150 mm per year. © 2017, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmosfera, UNAM.

"Gender, Agrobiodiversity, and Climate Change: A Study of Adaptation Practices in the Nepal Himalayas","Gender is seminal to agrobiodiversity management, and inequities are likely to be exacerbated under a changing climate. Using in-depth interviews with farmers and officials from government and non-government organizations in Nepal, we explore how gender relations are influenced by wider socio-economic changes, and how alterations in gender relations shape responses to climate change. Combining feminist political ecology and critical social-ecological systems thinking, we analyze how gender and adaptation interact as households abandon certain crops, adopt high-yielding varieties and shift to cash crops. We argue that the prevailing development paradigm reinforces inequitable gender structures in agrobiodiversity management, undermining adaptation to the changing climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Flows of change: dynamic water rights and water access in peri-urban Kathmandu,"Urbanization and the changing climate are increasingly influencing people's access to land and water. Changes in use of, and rights and access to, land and water are most acutely experienced in peri-urban areas. We analyze these changes in peri-urban Kathmandu, Nepal. Increasing pressures on land and growing water needs of an expanding population in Kathmandu Valley are creating new patterns of water use, water-related conflicts, and (in) securities. We use two case studies that are characteristic of these changes, with a focus on the microlevel redefinitions of, and struggles about, rights, access, and notions of legitimate water use, and what these mean for water security and water conflict in a socially and institutionally complex and dynamic environment. Our findings show that these water-related changes cause contestations and conflicts between peri-urban water users. Amid increasing competition for water, people are using new sources and technologies, searching for negotiated solutions based on local norms and rights, and co-opting other water users through cooperation to create access opportunities and avoid conflicts. Our cases show self-restraint in practices of claiming or accessing water, while avoidance of conflicts also derives from an awareness of unequal power relations between user groups, past experiences of violence used against protesters, and lack of active intervention to regulate increasing exploitation of peri-urban land and water resources.",0.5175122953295226,0.2547096294424726,0.1751752917778403,0.2967612113569777,0.036954566009995124,0.20170680721508774,0.9485097819183449
Long-lasting income shocks and adaptations: Evidence from coral bleaching in Indonesia,"This paper explores how people adapt to climate shocks, specifically coral bleaching, that have long-lasting impacts on income. Caused mainly by abnormally high sea surface temperature, coral bleaching has significant effects on marine resources. Using panel data from Indonesia and exogenous variations in bleaching, I observe that fishery households in affected areas experienced a decrease in income relative to other households. Although consumption expenditures did not decline significantly in response to these income shocks, these households reduced their protein consumption in the short and long runs. Regarding labor market outcomes, the affected households tended to substantially increase their labor supply and switch industries only in the long run.",0.6170950398731216,0.335458802588535,0.0905189926369926,0.6032463431788122,0.07923451819448663,0.05065811088769196,0.060060636427496865
"Factors associated with farm-level variation, and farmers' perception and climate change adaptation in smallholder mixed-farming livestock production system in Nepal","To identify factors associated with farm-level variability, to understand farmers' perception on climate change impacts, and to assess livestock climate change adaptation, a full-fledged household survey was launched in May 2012 in the Thulokhola watershed of Nuwakot district in Nepal. Factors identified for farm-level variation included land holding size and land types (irrigated, non-irrigated), male and female labours in a household, number of goats and cattle owned, fodder and forages, forest products utilised, number of animal grazing days, and income diversification. Drought conditions, erratic rain events, livestock diseases and parasites, decreasing pregnancy rate in animals, fodder and water shortages, and forest degradation were major climate change impacts in this watershed. To cope with these impacts, farmers have practiced introducing new animal breeds, stall feeding, planting grasses, storing feed for feed shortage months, purchasing feed, constructing ponds, and installing pipelines for water supply. However, they are limited and lacking scientific rigors.",0.944152990596967,0.18264950727832854,0.13184253575217458,0.42777651825100843,0.02149556154652659,0.014660830772366346,0.09401572198866433

"Climatic impacts and responses of migratory and non-migratory fishers of the Padma River, Bangladesh","This study empirically assesses the impacts of climatic events on the inland fishers (i.e., migratory and non-migratory) in Bangladesh and explores their responses to those events. Here, the migratory refers to the fishers who change their fishing location seasonally and voluntarily, whereas the non-migratory fishers fish in the same area. It is assumed that there exist differences in both the impacts of an event and the responses to the event between migratory and non-migratory fishers and therefore, a 'difference triangle' conceptual framework is developed and tested empirically under this research. Employing mix-method (qualitative and quantitative), a field study was conducted during July-October 2015 from the Padma River depended fishers. Identified climatic events under this study are: storms, changes in rainfall and temperature and riverbank erosion. The migratory and non-migratory fishers were affected quite similarly by storms and changes in rainfall and temperature. However, riverbank erosion affected only non-migratory fishers. Both the migratory and non-migratory fishers adopted different strategies to cope with different climatic events, like, they took shelter in safe places, sold productive assets, reduced food consumption, took credit from informal sources and employed their school-going children. As adaptation strategies, they modernized their fishing boats, intensified fishing, built embankments and diversified livelihoods. Unlike the impacts, considerable differences were found in their coping and adaptation strategies. Comparing to non-migratory fishers, a smaller number of migratory fishers sold their assets, took informal credit and intensified fishing and diversified their livelihoods. The result of this study indicates the significance of differences in the impacts of climatic events for the migratory and non-migratory fishers and therefore, this research has policy implication for the betterment of fishers' community in general. © 2018 by the authors.",0.7638367685678663,0.36251810799691736,0.09560228167702359,0.6262350384455887,0.24872490119781673,0.04146648892271136,0.05460346764329153
