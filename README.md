# GAMI Machine replication

This project aims to assess the extent to which the GAMI systematic review project could be replicated using machine learning

The notebook `0_data_exploration.ipynb` opens the GAMI data from the master file and the reconciled file, examines pairs of coders, and provides some initial predictions on the sector variable.

To run the notebook you could try jupyter lab or jupyter notebook https://jupyter.org/install

the original GAMI data should be placed in the `data` folder, and the results of the predictions are stored in `results` folder
